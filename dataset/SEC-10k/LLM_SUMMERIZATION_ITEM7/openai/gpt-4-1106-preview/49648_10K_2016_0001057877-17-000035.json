MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in this report, the general financial condition and results of operations for IDACORP and its subsidiaries and Idaho Power and its subsidiary are discussed. While reading the MD&A, please refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of IDACORP and Idaho Power. Also refer to \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and Part I - Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" in this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this MD&A and elsewhere in this report.\nINTRODUCTION\nIDACORP is a holding company formed in 1998 whose principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power. IDACORP's common stock is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol IDA\u201d. Idaho Power is an electric utility whose rates and other matters are regulated by the IPUC, OPUC, and FERC. Idaho Power generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to customers in its Idaho and Oregon service territories, as well as from the wholesale sale and transmission of electricity. Idaho Power experiences its highest retail energy sales during the summer irrigation and cooling season, with a lower peak in the winter that generally results from heating demand. Idaho Power's rates are established through regulatory proceedings that affect its ability to recover its costs and the potential to earn a return on its investment.\nIdaho Power is the parent of IERCo, a joint venturer in BCC, which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger generating plant owned in part by Idaho Power. IDACORP's other subsidiaries include IFS, an investor in affordable housing and other real estate investments; Ida-West Energy Company, an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the PURPA; and IDACORP Energy Services Co. (IESCo), which is the former limited partner of, and successor by merger to, IDACORP Energy L.P., a marketer of energy commodities that wound down operations in 2003.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nManagement's Outlook\nCustomer growth in Idaho Power's service area continues to benefit Idaho Power's revenues. To encourage continued responsible and sustainable growth, and as part of its planning for the future, Idaho Power actively participates in and supports state and local economic development initiatives. At the same time that Idaho Power pursues customer growth, it must also plan for that growth. Idaho Power plans for infrastructure that will support anticipated growth and allow it to continue to provide reliable, fair-priced electric power to its customers. To that end, Idaho Power's noteworthy capital projects include the replacement of aging assets, upgrades to generation plants, a multi-year plan for replacement of underground conductor, ongoing system upgrades, and continued permitting of the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West 500-kV transmission lines. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates total capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion over the next five years.\nIdaho Power operates within what it believes to be a constructive regulatory framework, achieved through general rate cases, subject-specific rate filings, tariff riders, and cost recovery mechanisms that share risks and benefits with Idaho Power's customers. To complement the regulatory framework, Idaho Power focuses on controlling power supply, operating, maintenance, and capital costs through process review and improvement initiatives, and by empowering employees to identify new means to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, and enhance individual and enterprise performance for the benefit of IDACORP's shareholders, Idaho Power's customers, and other stakeholders. Idaho Power's base rates were most recently reset in 2012 through general rate cases in Idaho and Oregon. During 2017, Idaho Power will continue to assess the need to file a general rate case to reset base rates in the coming years in Idaho or Oregon.\nSeparately, during 2016, IDACORP continued to make meaningful progress toward its target dividend payout ratio of between 50 and 60 percent of sustainable IDACORP earnings, which expanded on the progress made in previous years. From 2012 through 2016, IDACORP's board of directors approved a collective 83 percent increase in the quarterly dividend, from $0.30 to $0.55 per share.\n2016 Accomplishments and 2017 Initiatives\nIDACORP's business strategy emphasizes Idaho Power as IDACORP's core business. For the past several years, Idaho Power has been executing its three-part strategy of responsible planning, responsible development and protection of resources, and responsible energy use. This strategy is described in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business\" of this report. Examples of IDACORP's and Idaho Power's achievements and recognitions during 2016 under its three-part business strategy include:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP achieved net income growth for a ninth consecutive year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP provided a 19 percent cumulative total shareholder return over the past three years, including share price appreciation and dividends paid, ranking in the 88th percentile among peers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased IDACORP's quarterly common stock dividend from $0.51 per share to $0.55 per share;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>produced the best year of performance for Idaho Power's electric system reliability since formal measurement began in 2006;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>executed on business optimization initiatives, focusing on improving operations and controlling expenditures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>made continued progress toward the permitting of the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West 500-kV transmission projects;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>achieved Idaho Power's CO2 emissions intensity reduction goal;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>earned the highest rolling 12-month customer relationship index score (Idaho Power's internal measure of customer satisfaction) ever recorded by the company; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Idaho Power tied for 5th place in the annual \"Best Energy Companies\" rankings published by Public Utilities Fortnightly.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2017, IDACORP and Idaho Power have established a number of organizational initiatives, including the following:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continue to execute on the three core focuses for 2017-improving Idaho Power's core business, growing revenues, and enhancing the brand and positioning the company for the future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continue to enhance and promote Idaho Power's safety culture;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>grow financial strength by supporting business development in Idaho Power's service area while actively managing costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continue upward progress within IDACORP's target dividend payout ratio range;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pursue responsible investments that address customer growth while improving reliability, enhancing Idaho Power customers' experience, increasing shareholder value, and managing carbon impacts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>integrate new renewable generation resources into Idaho Power's grid and continue progress toward participation in the Western EIM, anticipated to begin in the spring of 2018, which is expected to capture intra-hour market opportunities to help achieve greater reliability and improve system dispatch.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview of General Factors and Trends Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition are affected by a number of factors, and the impact of those factors is discussed in more detail later in this MD&A. To provide context for the discussion elsewhere in this report, some of the more notable factors include the following:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Regulation of Rates and Cost Recovery: The price that Idaho Power is authorized to charge for its electric and transmission service is a critical factor in determining IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. Those rates are established by state regulatory commissions and the FERC, and are intended to allow Idaho Power an opportunity to recover its expenses and earn a reasonable return on investment. Because of the significant impact of ratemaking decisions, and in pursuit of its goal of advancing a purposeful regulatory strategy, Idaho Power focuses on timely recovery of its costs through filings with the company's regulators, working to put in place innovative regulatory mechanisms, and on the prudent management of expenses and investments. Idaho Power has a regulatory settlement stipulation in Idaho that includes provisions for the accelerated amortization of certain tax credits to help achieve a minimum 9.5 percent return on year-end equity in the Idaho jurisdiction (Idaho ROE). During 2017, Idaho Power will continue to assess the need to file a general rate case to reset base rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Economic Conditions and Loads: Economic conditions impact consumer demand for electricity and revenues, collectability of accounts, the volume of off-system sales, and the need to construct and improve infrastructure, purchase power, and implement programs to meet customer load demands. In recent years, Idaho Power has seen growth in the number of customers in its service area-in 2016, its customer count grew by 1.8 percent-and in employment in Idaho Power's service area, which grew by approximately 3.5 percent in 2016 based on Idaho Department of Labor preliminary December 2016 data. Idaho Power expects its number of customers to continue to\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nincrease in the foreseeable future. Idaho Power has in recent years supported State of Idaho-coordinated efforts to promote economic development with an emphasis on attracting industrial and commercial customers to its service area.\nIn August 2016, Idaho Power began preparing its 2017 IRP, Idaho Power's long-term forecast of loads and resources. The load forecast assumptions Idaho Power expects to use in the 2017 IRP are included in the table below. For comparison purposes, the analogous average annual growth rates used in the prior two IRPs are included.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Forecast for 2016-2021 Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20-Year Forecast\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annual Growth Rate: Retail Sales\n(Billed MWh)\n</td> <td>Annual Growth Rate: Annual Peak\n(Peak Demand)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annual Growth Rate: Retail Sales\n(Billed MWh)\n</td> <td>Annual Growth Rate: Annual Peak\n(Peak Demand)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 IRP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3%\n</td> <td>1.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> <td>1.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 IRP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1%\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2%\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013 IRP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2%\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1%\n</td> <td>1.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rate Base Growth and Infrastructure Investment: As noted above, the rates established by the IPUC and OPUC are determined so as to provide an opportunity for Idaho Power to recover authorized operating expenses and earn a reasonable return on rate base.\u201d Rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost (net of accumulated depreciation) of utility plant in service, subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items. Over time, rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write-offs as authorized by the IPUC and OPUC. In recent years, Idaho Power has been pursuing significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure, including major ongoing transmission projects such as the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West projects, in an effort to ensure an adequate supply of electricity, to provide service to new customers, and to maintain system reliability. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and component replacement, and the company is undertaking a significant relicensing effort for the Hells Canyon Complex (HCC), its largest hydroelectric generation resource. Idaho Power expects to include completed capital projects in its next general rate case or, in circumstances where appropriate, a single-issue rate case for individual projects with a significant capital cost. Depending on the outcome of the regulatory process and items such as the rate of return authorized by the IPUC and OPUC, this growth in rate base has the potential to increase Idaho Power's revenues and earnings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Weather Conditions: Weather and agricultural growing conditions have a significant impact on Idaho Power's energy sales. Relatively low and high temperatures result in greater energy use for heating and cooling, respectively. During the agricultural growing season, which in large part occurs during the second and third quarters, irrigation customers use electricity to operate irrigation pumps, and weather conditions can impact the timing and extent of use of those pumps. Idaho Power also has tiered rates and seasonal rates, which contribute to increased revenues during higher-load periods, most notably during the third quarter of each year when overall customer demand is highest. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of weather on sales of energy to residential and small commercial customers is mitigated through the Idaho FCA mechanism.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFurther, as Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities comprise nearly one-half of Idaho Power's nameplate generation capacity, precipitation levels impact the mix of Idaho Power's generation resources. When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must rely on more expensive generation sources and purchased power. When favorable hydroelectric generating conditions exist for Idaho Power, they also may exist for other Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facility operators, lowering regional wholesale market prices and impacting the revenue Idaho Power receives from off-system sales of its excess power. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of this volatility is addressed through the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mitigation of Impact of Fuel and Purchased Power Expense: In addition to hydroelectric generation, Idaho Power relies significantly on coal and natural gas to fuel its generation facilities and power purchases in the wholesale markets. Fuel costs are impacted by electricity sales volumes, the terms of contracts for fuel, Idaho Power's generation capacity, the availability of hydroelectric generation resources, transmission capacity, energy market prices, and Idaho Power's hedging program for managing fuel costs. Recently, low natural gas prices have made operation of Idaho Power's natural gas power plants more economical, resulting in increased operation of those plants and decreased operation of coal-fired plants. Purchased power costs are impacted by the terms of contracts for purchased power, the rate of expansion of alternative energy generation sources such as wind or solar energy, and wholesale energy market\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nprices. The Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms mitigate in large part the potential adverse impacts of fluctuations in power supply costs to Idaho Power.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional elections: The recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation, and government policy. While it is uncertain whether and when any such changes will occur, they could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's businesses and the electric utility industry. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals discussed during and after the election that could have a material impact on IDACORP and Idaho Power include, but are not limited to, reform of the federal tax code; infrastructure renewal programs; and modifications to public company reporting requirements and environmental regulation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Regulatory and Environmental Compliance Costs: Idaho Power is subject to extensive federal and state laws, policies, and regulations, as well as regulatory actions and audits by agencies and quasi-governmental agencies, including the FERC and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Compliance with these requirements directly influences Idaho Power's operating environment and affects Idaho Power's operating costs. Environmental laws and regulations, in particular, may increase the cost of operating generation plants and constructing new facilities, require that Idaho Power install additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants, or require that Idaho Power cease operating certain generation plants. For instance, the Boardman coal-fired power plant, in which Idaho Power owns a 10-percent interest, is scheduled to cease coal-fired operations by the end of 2020, a decision driven in large part by the substantial cost of environmental controls required by existing regulations. Similarly, Idaho Power is assessing the early closure of the North Valmy coal-fired power plant, of which Idaho Power owns a 50-percent interest, and in October and November 2016 filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC, respectively, requesting accelerated depreciation of the facility. Idaho Power expects to spend a considerable amount on environmental compliance and controls in the next decade.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Water Management and Relicensing of the Hells Canyon Hydroelectric Project: Because of Idaho Power's reliance on stream flow in the Snake River and its tributaries, Idaho Power participates in numerous proceedings and venues that may affect its water rights, seeking to preserve the long-term availability of its rights for its hydroelectric projects. Also, Idaho Power is involved in renewing its long-term federal license for the HCC, its largest hydroelectric generation source. Given the number of parties and issues involved, Idaho Power's relicensing costs have been and will continue to be substantial. Idaho Power cannot currently determine the terms of, and costs associated with, any resulting long-term license.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSummary of 2016 Financial Results\nThe following is a summary of Idaho Power's net income, net income attributable to IDACORP, and IDACORP's earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands, except earnings per share amounts):\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Idaho Power net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to IDACORP, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average outstanding shares - diluted (000's)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IDACORP, Inc. earnings per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to IDACORP, Inc. for year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015 (items are in millions and are before tax unless otherwise noted):\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to IDACORP, Inc. - December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Idaho Power net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer growth, net of associated power supply costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Usage per customer, net of associated power supply costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating and maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other changes in operating revenues and expenses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Idaho Power operating income prior to sharing mechanisms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in operating income as a result of sharing mechanisms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Idaho Power operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total decrease in Idaho Power net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IESCo income from legal settlement (net of tax)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other changes (net of tax)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to IDACORP, Inc. - December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIDACORP's 2016 net income increased $3.6 million compared with 2015. While Idaho Power's 2016 net income was relatively flat, decreasing $1.7 million compared with 2015, net income from other subsidiaries increased IDACORP's net income by $5.3 million.\nContinued customer growth at Idaho Power increased operating income by $11.2 million, which was more than offset by a $14.7 million decrease from lower usage per customer in 2016 compared with 2015. Winter temperatures in 2016 were slightly colder than 2015, but milder summer temperatures in 2016 led to lower sales volumes, revenues, and operating income. Other operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses were $9.7 million higher in 2016 compared with 2015, largely related to higher variable labor-related costs.\nDuring 2015, Idaho Power recorded a total of $3.2 million as a provision against current revenue related to the October 2014 Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation that required sharing with Idaho customers of a portion of 2015 earnings that exceeded 10.0 percent. During 2016, no such sharing provision was recorded as Idaho Power's Idaho ROE did not exceed 10.0 percent. At December 31, 2016, the full $45 million of additional ADITC remains available for future use under the terms of the October 2014 Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation.\nIdaho Power's income tax expense was lower in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to greater net flow-through income tax benefits, additional share-based compensation tax benefits related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, and lower pretax income. These decreases were partially offset by a smaller flow-through benefit of a tax deductible make-whole premium that Idaho Power paid in connection with the early redemption of long-term debt in 2016 compared with the flow-through benefit of an early bond redemption in 2015.\nIDACORP's 2016 net income also included a $3.7 million increase, net of tax, in IESCo's earnings, a result of a December 2016 settlement relating to the California energy market proceedings. Refer to Note 10 - Contingencies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the settlement. IDACORP also benefited from distributions related to fully-amortized affordable housing investments at IFS, which reduced IDACORP's income tax expense.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section of the MD&A takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected IDACORP's and Idaho Power's earnings. In this analysis, the results for 2016 are compared with 2015 and the results for 2015 are compared with 2014.\nUtility Operations\nThe table below presents Idaho Power's energy sales and supply (in thousands of MWh) for the last three years.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General business sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-system sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total energy sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hydroelectric generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas and other generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total system generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(935\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,037\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total energy supply\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales Volume and Generation: In 2016, general business sales volumes decreased less than 1 percent compared with the prior year. Winter temperatures in 2016 were slightly colder than 2015, but milder summer temperatures in 2016 led to lower sales volumes. Also, a shorter irrigation season due to a later start in 2016 compared with 2015 resulted in lower usage per irrigation customer than during 2015.\nOff-system sales volumes decreased 68 thousand MWh, or 5 percent, during 2016 compared with 2015. Low wholesale market prices reduced economic benefits of operating Idaho Power's non-hydroelectric generation facilities for off-system sales.\nFavorable hydroelectric generating conditions from greater snowpack in the spring of 2016 compared with the spring of 2015 led to increased hydroelectric generation in 2016. Coal-fired generation decreased in 2016 compared with 2015 as low wholesale market prices led to an increase in purchased power.\nThe financial impacts of fluctuations in off-system sales, purchased power, fuel expense, and other power supply-related expenses are addressed in Idaho Power's Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms, which are described later in this MD&A.\nGeneral Business Revenues: The table below presents Idaho Power's general business revenues (in thousands), MWh sales (in thousands), and number of customers for the last three years.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>514,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>512,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>306,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,156,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,164,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,140,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for sharing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,999\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue related to HCC relicensing AFUDC(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,706\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,706\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,706\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general business revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,145,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,151,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,122,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume of Sales (MWh)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MWh sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of customers at year-end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>444,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>436,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>428,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>534,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>524,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Idaho Power is collecting approximately $10.7 million annually in the Idaho jurisdiction for AFUDC on HCC construction work in progress, but is deferring revenue recognition of the amounts collected until the license is issued and the accumulated license costs are placed in service.\nChanges in rates, changes in customer demand, and changes in FCA revenues are typically the primary causes of fluctuations in general business revenue from period to period. See \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for a list of rate changes implemented over the last three years. The primary influences on changes in customer demand for electricity are weather, economic conditions, and energy efficiency. Extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating, while moderate temperatures decrease sales. Precipitation levels and the timing of precipitation during the agricultural growing season also affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps. Boise, Idaho, weather-related information for the last three years is presented in the following table.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Normal(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Heating degree-days(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cooling degree-days(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Heating and cooling degree-days are common measures used in the utility industry to analyze the demand for electricity and indicate when a customer would use electricity for heating and air conditioning. A degree-day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from 65 degrees. Each degree of temperature above 65 degrees is counted as one cooling degree-day, and each degree of temperature below 65 degrees is counted as one heating degree-day. While Boise, Idaho weather conditions are not necessarily representative of weather conditions throughout Idaho Power's service area, the greater Boise area has the majority of Idaho Power's customers.\n(2) Normal heating degree-days and cooling degree-days elements are, by convention, the arithmetic mean of the elements computed over 30 consecutive years. The annual normal amounts are the sum of the 12 monthly normal amounts. These normal amounts are computed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nIdaho Power's rate structure provides for higher rates during the summer when system loads are at their highest, and includes tiers such that rates increase as a customer's consumption level increases. These seasonal and tiered rate structures contribute to seasonal fluctuations in revenues and earnings.\nGeneral Business Revenues - 2016 Compared with 2015: General business revenue decreased $5.0 million in 2016 compared with 2015.

Off-system sales volumes decreased 44 percent, as 2014 sales benefited from more favorable market conditions, at times, for selling power off-system. The average price of off-system sales transactions in 2015 was 29 percent lower than 2014, indicative of generally lower market prices in 2015.

Greater customer participation in energy efficiency programs increased revenue and corresponding expense in 2016 compared with 2015. Most energy efficiency activities are funded through a rider mechanism on customer bills. Energy efficiency program expenditures funded through the rider are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount of revenues recorded in other revenues, resulting in no net impact on earnings. The cumulative variance between expenditures and amounts collected through the rider is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability pending future collection from, or obligation to, customers. A liability balance indicates that Idaho Power has collected more than it has spent and an asset balance indicates that Idaho Power has spent more than it has collected. At December 31, 2016, Idaho Power's energy efficiency rider balances were a $5.6 million regulatory asset in the Oregon jurisdiction and a $10.7 million regulatory liability in the Idaho jurisdiction.\nOther Revenues - 2015 Compared with 2014: Other revenues increased $6.4 million, or 8 percent, in 2015.

The intermittent, non-dispatchable nature of the PURPA generation increases the likelihood that Idaho Power will at times be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources and may be required to sell its excess power in the wholesale power market at a significant loss. The other purchased power cost per MWh often exceeds the off-system sales revenue per MWh because Idaho Power generally needs to purchase more power during heavy load periods than during light load periods, and conversely has less energy available for off-system sales during heavy load periods than light load periods. Market energy prices are typically higher during heavy load periods than during light load periods. Also, in accordance with Idaho Power's risk management policy, Idaho Power may purchase or sell energy several months in advance of anticipated delivery. The regional energy market price is dynamic and additional energy purchase or sale transactions that Idaho Power makes at current market prices may be noticeably different than the advance purchase or sale transaction prices. Most of the non-PURPA purchased power and substantially all of the PURPA power purchase costs are recovered through base rates and Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nPurchased Power - 2016 Compared with 2015: Purchased power expense increased $19.3 million, or 9 percent, in 2016. The increase was due primarily to increased volumes purchased from both PURPA and non-PURPA sources attributable largely to lower market prices at times that encouraged market purchases rather than operating some generating units. Volume increases were partially offset by lower non-PURPA wholesale market prices.\nPurchased Power - 2015 Compared with 2014: Purchased power expense decreased $18.2 million, or 7 percent, in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to reduced volumes purchased from both PURPA and non-PURPA sources. Volume decreases were partially offset by increases in average prices of both PURPA and non-PURPA sources.\nFuel Expense: The table below presents Idaho Power's fuel expenses and thermal generation for the last three years (in thousands, except per MWh amounts):\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fuel expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MWh generated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MWh generated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh - Coal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh - Natural gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average, all sources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) 2015 excludes 147 MWh of generation from the Jim Bridger power plant for which costs were capitalized during feasibility testing of capital projects under contemplation.\n(2)Includes a negligible amount of expense and generation related to the Salmon diesel-fired generation plant.\nThe majority of the fuel for Idaho Power's jointly-owned coal-fired plants is purchased through long-term contracts, including purchases from BCC, a one-third owned joint venture of IERCo. The price of coal from BCC is subject to fluctuations in mine operating expenses, geologic conditions, and production levels. BCC supplies up to two-thirds of the coal used by the Jim Bridger plant. Natural gas is mainly purchased on the regional wholesale spot market at published index prices. In addition to commodity (variable) costs, both natural gas and coal expense include costs that are more fixed in nature for items such as capacity charges, transportation, and fuel handling. Period to period variances in fuel expense per MWh are noticeably impacted by these fixed charges when generation output is substantially different between the periods.\nFuel Expense - 2016 Compared with 2015: In 2016, fuel expense decreased $6.7 million, or 4 percent, compared with 2015, due principally to decreased output from coal-fired plants and natural gas plants during 2016. Overall generation decreased 15 percent due to a change in resource mix resulting from increased purchase requirements from cogeneration and small power production (CSPP) projects, resource constraints at various generating locations, including Langley and Bridger, due to scheduled maintenance and other factors, and more open market purchases for economic reasons. The volume decreases were partially offset by higher coal prices due to higher mining costs at BCC. The higher mining costs resulted in part due to issues with underground mining equipment that is no longer in service.\nFuel Expense - 2015 Compared with 2014: In 2015, fuel expense decreased $15.0 million, or 7 percent, compared with 2014, due principally to decreased output from coal-fired plants during 2015 combined with lower regional natural gas prices for fuel used at the natural gas plants. Overall generation decreased 4 percent due to lower system loads and lower wholesale energy prices. The expense per MWh for natural gas decreased approximately 30 percent in 2015 compared with 2014. These lower natural gas prices led to a shift of generation from coal-fired plants to natural gas plants.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms: Idaho Power's power supply costs (primarily purchased power and fuel expense, less off-system sales) can vary significantly from year to year. Volatility of power supply costs arises from factors such as weather conditions, wholesale market prices, volumes of power purchased and sold in the wholesale markets, Idaho Power's hydroelectric and thermal generation volumes and fuel costs, generation plant availability, and retail loads. To address the volatility of power supply costs, Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in the Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions allow Idaho Power to recover from, or refund to, customers most of the fluctuations in power supply costs. In the Idaho jurisdiction, the PCA includes a cost or benefit sharing ratio that allocates the deviations in net power supply expenses between customers (95 percent) and Idaho Power (5 percent), with the exception of PURPA power purchases and demand response program incentives, which are allocated 100 percent to customers. The Idaho deferral period, or PCA year, runs from April 1 through March 31. Amounts deferred during the PCA year are primarily recovered or refunded during the subsequent June 1 through May 31 period. Because of the power cost adjustment mechanisms, the primary financial impacts of power supply cost variations is that cash is paid out but recovery from customers does not occur until a future period, or cash that is collected is refunded to customers in a future period, resulting in fluctuations in operating cash flows from year to year.\nThe table that follows presents the components of the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms for the last three years (in thousands).\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Idaho power supply cost deferrals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,841\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48,104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of prior year authorized balances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total power cost adjustment expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,330\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe power supply accruals (deferrals) represent the portion of the power supply cost fluctuations accrued (deferred) under the power cost adjustment mechanisms. When actual power supply costs are higher than the amount forecasted in power cost adjustment rates, which was the case for all periods presented, most of the difference is deferred. The amortization of the prior year's balances represents the offset to the amounts being collected or refunded in the current PCA year that were deferred or accrued in the prior PCA year (the true-up component of the PCA).\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2016 Compared with 2015: Actual net power supply cost deferrals increased in 2016 relative to 2015, a change of $8.0 million-from $35.8 million to $43.8 million. The increase in the deferral is due in part to higher fuel costs related to coal and purchased power with less surplus sales than forecasted. The $38.5 million of amortization offsets the collection from customers of prior years' deferrals and was lower in 2016 as Idaho Power is amortizing a smaller deferral balance in the current year than the prior year.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2015 Compared with 2014: Actual net power supply cost deferrals decreased in 2015 relative to 2014, a change of $12.3 million-from $48.1 million to $35.8 million. Power supply costs collected through base rates increased on June 1, 2015, resulting in less costs needing to be recovered through the power cost adjustment mechanisms since that time. The $52.6 million million of amortization offsets the collection from customers of prior years' deferrals.\nOther Operations and Maintenance Expenses: The changes in other O&M expenses for the periods presented are discussed below.\nO&M - 2016 Compared with 2015: Other O&M expense increased by $9.7 million in 2016 compared with 2015, an increase of 3 percent, due primarily to the following factors:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>labor-related expenses increased $6.5 million, or 3 percent, in 2016 due to normal escalations in labor and benefits costs and higher variable employee costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>scheduled maintenance at the Langley Gulch natural gas-fired generation plant increased O&M expenses $1.6 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $1.1 million increase primarily related to transmission agreements entered into in October 2015, which also resulted in a corresponding increase in other revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nO&M - 2015 Compared with 2014: Other O&M expense decreased by $12.4 million in 2015 compared with 2014, a decrease of 3.5 percent, due to the following factors:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$16.7 million was recorded as additional pension expense in 2014 related to a December 2011 Idaho regulatory settlement agreement, which required sharing with Idaho customers of a portion of earnings in excess of a 10.0 percent Idaho ROE (thereby reducing customers' future pension obligations).

The decrease was primarily due to greater net flow-through income tax benefits at Idaho Power, a tax benefit from the adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation, distributions related to fully-amortized affordable housing investments at IDACORP, and lower Idaho Power pre-tax earnings in 2016.\nIncome tax expense in 2015 increased significantly compared with 2014, principally as a result of a 2014 flow-through tax benefit related to the cumulative impact of tax accounting method changes for Idaho Power's capitalized repairs deduction that did not recur in 2015. For additional information relating to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes, including the availability of tax credit carryforwards, see Note 2 - Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nIdaho Power continues to pursue significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure in an effort to ensure an adequate supply of electricity, to provide service to new customers, and to maintain system reliability. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and component replacement. Idaho Power's expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, excluding AFUDC, were $287 million in 2016, $284 million in 2015, and $265 million in 2014. Idaho Power expects these substantial capital expenditures to continue, with estimated total capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion expected over the period from 2017 through 2021.\nIdaho Power funds its liquidity needs for capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. As of February 17, 2017, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's access to debt, equity, and credit arrangements included:\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>their respective $100 million and $300 million revolving credit facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of debt securities and common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Idaho Power's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of first mortgage bonds and debt securities; $500 million is available for issuance pursuant to state regulatory authority; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP's and Idaho Power's issuance of commercial paper, which may be issued up to an amount equal to the available credit capacity under their respective credit facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on planned capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses for 2017, the companies believe they will be able to meet capital requirements and fund corporate expenses during 2017 with a combination of existing cash and operating cash flows generated by Idaho Power's utility business, together with proceeds from either draws on credit facilities or Idaho Power's issuance of debt securities. IDACORP and Idaho Power believe they could meet any short-term cash shortfall with existing credit facilities and expect to continue to manage short-term liquidity through commercial paper markets.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power monitor capital markets with a view toward opportunistic debt and equity transactions, taking into account current and potential future long-term needs. As a result, IDACORP may issue debt securities or common stock, and Idaho Power may issue debt securities, if the companies believe terms available in the capital markets are favorable and that issuances would be financially prudent. Idaho Power also periodically analyzes whether partial or full early redemption of one or more existing outstanding series of first mortgage bonds is desirable, and in some cases may refinance indebtedness with new indebtedness issued with more favorable terms. To that end, on March 10, 2016, Idaho Power issued $120 million in principal amount of 4.05% first mortgage bonds, Series J, maturing on March 1, 2046. On April 11, 2016, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to maturity, its $100 million in principal amount of 6.15% first mortgage bonds, Series H, due April 2019. In accordance with the redemption provisions of the original terms of the notes, the redemption included payment by Idaho Power of a make-whole premium of $14 million. The make-whole premium resulted in a current income tax deduction, which under Idaho Power's regulatory flow-through tax accounting produced an income tax benefit of approximately $5.6 million recorded in the second quarter of 2016. Idaho Power also expects to receive an incremental net benefit to net income as a result of the lower interest rate of the notes issued in March 2016 compared with the interest rate associated with the redeemed notes. Idaho Power used a portion of the net proceeds of the March 2016 sale of first mortgage bonds, medium-term notes to effect the redemption. The companies do not expect to redeem any existing outstanding debt during 2017.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power seek to maintain capital structures of approximately 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, and maintaining this ratio influences IDACORP's and Idaho Power's debt and equity issuance decisions. As of December 31, 2016, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's capital structures, as calculated for purposes of applicable debt covenants, were as follows:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIDACORP and Idaho Power generally maintain their cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, money market funds, and bank deposits.\nOperating Cash Flows\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's principal sources of cash flows from operations are Idaho Power's sales of electricity and transmission capacity. Significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of fuel and power, other operating expenses, interest, income taxes, and pension plan contributions. Operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather conditions, rates and the outcome of regulatory proceedings, and economic conditions. As fuel and purchased power are significant uses of cash, Idaho Power has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of the fluctuation in those costs. However, if actual costs rise above the level allowed in retail rates, deferral balances increase (reflected as a regulatory asset), negatively affecting operating cash flows until such time as those costs, with interest, are recovered from customers.\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating cash inflows in 2016 were $348 million and $311 million, respectively, a decrease of $5 million for IDACORP and $35 million decrease for Idaho Power when compared with 2015. Significant items that affected the companies' operating cash flows in 2016 relative to 2015 were as follows:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in regulatory assets and liabilities, mostly related to the relative amounts of power supply and fixed costs deferred and collected under the Idaho rate mechanisms, decreased operating cash inflows by $19 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in deferred taxes and in taxes accrued and receivable combined to decrease cash flows by $3 million and $34 million at IDACORP and Idaho Power, respectively;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Idaho Power received $24 million of distributions from IERCo's investment in BCC for 2016, compared with $11 million in 2015.

Idaho Power's construction expenditures, including the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction, were $297 million, $294 million, and $274 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. These capital expenditures were primarily for construction of utility infrastructure needed to address Idaho Power's aging plant and equipment, customer growth, and environmental and regulatory compliance requirements. As discussed in \"Capital Requirements\" below, Idaho Power received $8 million and $11 million in 2016 and 2015 from Boardman-to-Hemingway project joint permitting participants relating to a portion of these construction expenditures.\nIdaho Power has a Rabbi trust designated to provide funding for obligations of its nonqualified defined benefit plans. In the Rabbi trust, Idaho Power purchased $15 million, $14 million, and $8 million of available-for-sale securities in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In 2016 and 2015, Idaho Power received $16 million and $34 million, respectively, of proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities and used $10 million and $30 million of the proceeds, respectively, to acquire company-owned life insurance.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nFinancing activities provide supplemental cash for both day-to-day operations and capital requirements as needed. Idaho Power funds liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital, managing commodity price risk, and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. IDACORP funds its cash requirements, such as payment of taxes, capital contributions to Idaho Power, and non-utility operating expenses through cash flows from operations, commercial paper markets, sales of common stock, and credit facilities. The following are significant items and transactions that affected financing cash flows in 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>on March 10, 2016, Idaho Power issued $120 million in principal amount of 4.05% first mortgage bonds Series J, maturing March 1, 2046;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>on April 11, 2016, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to maturity, $100 million of its 6.15% first mortgage bonds, Series H, due April 1, 2019, and paid a related make-whole premium of $14 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>on March 6, 2015, Idaho Power issued $250 million in principal amount of 3.65% first mortgage bonds, Series J, maturing on March 1, 2045;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>on April 23, 2015, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to maturity, $120 million in principal amount of 6.025% first mortgage bonds, medium-term notes due July 2018, and paid a related make-whole premium of $18 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP and Idaho Power paid dividends of approximately $105 million, $97 million, and $88 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IDACORP's net change in commercial paper borrowings provided cash of $2 million in 2016 and used cash of $11 million and $23 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Idaho Power borrowed $22 million in commercial paper in December 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Programs and Available Liquidity\nIDACORP Equity Programs: In recent years IDACORP has entered into sales agency agreements under which IDACORP could offer and sell shares of its common stock from time to time through BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC as IDACORP's agent. The most recent agency agreement terminated in May 2016, but IDACORP may choose to enter into a new sales agency agreement in the future. On May 20, 2016, IDACORP filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which became effective upon filing, for the potential offer and sale of an unspecified amount of shares of common stock. As of the date of this report, IDACORP is assessing whether to execute a new sales agency agreement for the issuance and sale of common stock, as the company does not anticipate issuing any shares of its common stock outside of its equity or deferral compensation programs in 2017.\nSince 2012, IDACORP has not used original issue shares of common stock for the IDACORP, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan or the Idaho Power Company Employee Savings Plan, but instead plan administrators have used market purchases of IDACORP common stock. However, IDACORP may determine at any time to use original issuances of common stock under those plans. As noted above, an important component of that determination will be IDACORP's and Idaho Power's capital structure.\nIdaho Power First Mortgage Bonds: Idaho Power's issuance of long-term indebtedness is subject to the approval of the IPUC, OPUC, and Wyoming Public Service Commission (WPSC). In April and May 2016, Idaho Power received orders from the IPUC, OPUC, and WPSC authorizing Idaho Power to issue and sell from time to time up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities and first mortgage bonds, subject to conditions specified in the orders. Authority from the IPUC is effective through May 31, 2019, subject to extension upon request to the IPUC. The OPUC's and WPSC's orders do not impose a time limitation for issuances, but the OPUC order does impose a number of other conditions, including a requirement that the interest rates for the debt securities or first mortgage bonds fall within either (a) designated spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury rates or (b) a maximum interest rate limit of seven percent.\nOn September 27, 2016, Idaho Power entered into a selling agency agreement with seven banks named in the agreement in connection with the potential issuance and sale from time to time of up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds, secured medium term notes, Series K (Series K Notes), under Idaho Power's Indenture of Mortgage and Deed\nof Trust, dated as of October 1, 1937, as amended and supplemented (Indenture). At the same time, Idaho Power entered into the Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 1, 2016, to the Indenture (Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture). The Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture provides for, among other items, (a) the issuance of up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of Series K Notes pursuant to the Indenture and (b) the increase of the maximum amount of obligations to be secured by the Indenture to $2.5 billion (which maximum amount may be further increased or decreased by Idaho Power without the consent of the holders of first mortgage bonds). As of the date of this report, Idaho Power had not sold any first mortgage bonds, including Series K Notes, or debt securities under the selling agency agreement.\nThe issuance of first mortgage bonds requires that Idaho Power meet interest coverage and security provisions set forth in the Indenture. Future issuances of first mortgage bonds are subject to satisfaction of covenants and security provisions set forth in the Indenture, market conditions, regulatory authorizations, and covenants contained in other financing agreements.\nThe Indenture limits the amount of first mortgage bonds at any one time outstanding to $2.5 billion, and as a result the maximum amount of first mortgage bonds Idaho Power could issue as of December 31, 2016, was limited to approximately $759 million. Idaho Power may increase the $2.5 billion limit on the maximum amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding by filing a supplemental indenture with the trustee as provided in the Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust. Separately, the Indenture also limits the amount of additional first mortgage bonds that Idaho Power may issue to the sum of (a) the principal amount of retired first mortgage bonds and (b) 60 percent of total unfunded property additions, as defined in the Indenture. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power could issue approximately $1.7 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on retired first mortgage bonds and total unfunded property additions.\nRefer to Note 4 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information regarding long-term financing arrangements.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power Credit Facilities: In November 2015, IDACORP and Idaho Power entered into credit agreements for $100 million and $300 million credit facilities, respectively. These facilities replaced IDACORP's and Idaho Power's existing Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreements, dated October 26, 2011, as amended. Each of the credit facilities may be used for general corporate purposes and commercial paper back-up. IDACORP's facility permits borrowings under a revolving line of credit of up to $100 million at any one time outstanding, including swingline loans not to exceed $10 million at any time and letters of credit not to exceed $50 million at any time. IDACORP's facility may be increased, subject to specified conditions, to $150 million. Idaho Power's facility permits borrowings through the issuance of loans and standby letters of credit of up to $300 million at any one time outstanding, including swingline loans not to exceed $30 million at any one time and letters of credit not to exceed $100 million at any time. Idaho Power's facility may be increased, subject to specified conditions, to $450 million. The interest rates for any borrowings under the facilities are based on either (1) a floating rate that is equal to the highest of the prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.5 percent, or LIBOR rate plus 1.0 percent, or (2) the LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, provided that the federal funds rate and LIBOR rate will not be less than zero percent. The applicable margin is based on IDACORP's or Idaho Power's, as applicable, senior unsecured long-term indebtedness credit rating, as set forth on a schedule to the credit agreements. The companies also pay a facility fee based on the respective company's credit rating for senior unsecured long-term debt securities.\nEach facility contains a covenant requiring each company to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization equal to or less than 65 percent as of the end of each fiscal quarter. In determining the leverage ratio, consolidated indebtedness\u201d broadly includes all indebtedness of the respective borrower and its subsidiaries, including, in some instances, indebtedness evidenced by certain hybrid securities (as defined in the credit agreement). Consolidated total capitalization\u201d is calculated as the sum of all consolidated indebtedness, consolidated stockholders' equity of the borrower and its subsidiaries, and the aggregate value of outstanding hybrid securities. At December 31, 2016, the leverage ratios for IDACORP and Idaho Power were 45 percent and 47 percent, respectively. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to utilize the credit facilities is conditioned upon their continued compliance with the leverage ratio covenants included in the credit facilities. There are additional covenants, subject to exceptions, that prohibit certain mergers, acquisitions, and investments, restrict the creation of certain liens, and prohibit entering into any agreements restricting dividend payments from any material subsidiary. At December 31, 2016, IDACORP and Idaho Power believe they were in compliance with all facility covenants. Further, IDACORP and Idaho Power do not believe they will be in violation or breach of their respective debt covenants during 2017.\nThe events of default under both facilities include, without limitation, non-payment of principal, interest, or fees; materially false representations or warranties; breach of covenants; bankruptcy or insolvency events; condemnation of property; cross-default to certain other indebtedness; failure to pay certain judgments; change of control; failure of IDACORP to own free and\nclear of liens the voting stock of Idaho Power; the occurrence of specified events or the incurring of specified liabilities relating to benefit plans; and the incurring of certain environmental liabilities, subject, in certain instances, to cure periods.\nUpon any event of default relating to the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of IDACORP or Idaho Power or the appointment of a receiver, the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the applicable facility and to issue letters of credit will automatically terminate and all unpaid obligations will become due and payable. Upon any other event of default, the lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the outstanding loans or greater than 50 percent of the aggregate commitments (required lenders) or the administrative agent with the consent of the required lenders may terminate or suspend the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and to issue letters of credit under the facility and/or declare the obligations to be due and payable. During an event of default under the facilities, the lenders may, at their option, increase the applicable interest rates then in effect and the letter of credit fee by 2.0 percentage points per annum. A ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the cost of borrowing, but would not result in a default or acceleration of the debt under the facilities. However, if Idaho Power's ratings are downgraded below investment grade, Idaho Power must extend or renew its authority for borrowings under its IPUC and OPUC regulatory orders.\nWhile the credit facilities provide for an original maturity date of November 6, 2020, the credit agreements grant IDACORP and Idaho Power the right to request up to two one-year extensions, in each case subject to certain conditions. On November 7, 2016, IDACORP and Idaho Power executed the first extension agreement with the consent of all the lenders, extending the maturity date under both credit agreements to November 5, 2021. No other terms of the credit facilities, including the amount of permitted borrowing under the credit agreements, were affected by the extensions.\nWithout additional approval from the IPUC, the OPUC, and the WPSC, the aggregate amount of short-term borrowings by Idaho Power at any one time outstanding may not exceed $450 million. Idaho Power has obtained approval of the state public utility commissions of Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming for the issuance of short-term borrowings through November 2022.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power Commercial Paper: IDACORP and Idaho Power have commercial paper programs under which they issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the available capacity under their respective credit facilities, described above. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities are available to the companies to support borrowings under their commercial paper programs. The commercial paper issuances are used to provide an additional financing source for the companies' short-term liquidity needs. The maturities of the commercial paper issuances will vary, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. Individual instruments carry a fixed rate during their respective terms, although the interest rates are reflective of current market conditions, subjecting the companies to fluctuations in interest rates.\nAvailable Short-Term Borrowing Liquidity\nThe following table outlines available short-term borrowing liquidity as of the dates specified: Table 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,800\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Identified for other use(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net balance available\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Port of Morrow and American Falls bonds that Idaho Power could be required to purchase prior to maturity under the optional or mandatory purchase provisions of the bonds, if the remarketing agent for the bonds were unable to sell the bonds to third parties.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Holding company only.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below presents additional information about short-term commercial paper borrowing during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Table 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year end:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Daily average amount outstanding during the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate during the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum month-end balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Holding company only.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt February 17, 2017, IDACORP had no loans outstanding under its credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding, and Idaho Power had no loans outstanding under its credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding.\nImpact of Credit Ratings on Liquidity and Collateral Obligations\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, depends in part on their respective credit ratings. The following table outlines the ratings of Idaho Power's and IDACORP's securities, and the ratings outlook, by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services as of the date of this report:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Issuer Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Mortgage Bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>None\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Secured Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>None\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's Rating Services:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Credit Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese security ratings reflect the views of the ratings agencies. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings and, accordingly, each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nIdaho Power maintains margin agreements relating to its wholesale commodity contracts that allow performance assurance collateral to be requested of and/or posted with certain counterparties. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power had posted no performance assurance collateral. Should Idaho Power experience a reduction in its credit rating on its unsecured debt to below investment grade, Idaho Power could be subject to requests by its wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral, and counterparties to derivative instruments and other forward contracts could request immediate payment or demand immediate ongoing full daily collateralization on derivative instruments and contracts in net liability positions. Based upon Idaho Power's current energy and fuel portfolio and market conditions as of December 31, 2016, the amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a downgrade to below investment grade is approximately $11.6 million. To minimize capital requirements, Idaho Power actively monitors its portfolio exposure and the potential exposure to additional requests for performance assurance collateral through sensitivity analysis.\nCapital Requirements\nIdaho Power's construction expenditures, excluding AFUDC, were $287 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The table below presents Idaho Power's estimated cash requirements for construction, excluding AFUDC, for 2017 through 2021 (in millions of dollars). However, given the uncertainty associated with the timing of infrastructure projects and associated expenditures, actual expenditures and their timing could deviate substantially from those set forth in the table.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected capital expenditures (excluding AFUDC)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290-300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285-295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>900-950\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInfrastructure Projects: A significant portion of expected capital expenditures included in the five-year forecast above relate to a large number of small projects as Idaho Power continues to add to its system to accommodate growth and improve reliability and operational effectiveness. These projects involve significant capital expenditures. Examples of anticipated system enhancements planned for 2017 through 2021 and estimated costs include the following:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$35-$65 million per year for transmission system projects other than the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West projects;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$75-$95 million per year for construction and replacement of distribution lines and stations, including replacement of underground distribution cables;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$25-$45 million per year for ongoing improvements and replacements at coal- and natural gas-fired plants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$45-$65 million per year for hydroelectric plant improvement programs, including relicensing and mitigation costs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$45-$65 million per year for general plant improvements, such as land and buildings, vehicles, information technology, and communication equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Major Infrastructure Projects: Idaho Power has recently completed or is engaged in the development of a number of significant projects and has entered into arrangements with third parties for joint development of infrastructure projects. The most notable projects are described below.\nJim Bridger Plant Selective Catalytic Reduction Equipment: Idaho Power and the plant co-owners recently completed installation of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions at the Jim Bridger power plant, in order to comply with regional haze rules. The regional haze rules provided for installation of SCR on unit 3 and unit 4. The rules provide for an equivalent technology for NOx reductions on unit 2 by 2021 and unit 1 by 2022. Idaho Power has expended $100 million, excluding AFUDC, on SCR installation at units 3 and 4 through December 31, 2016. The unit 3 SCR was operating as of November 2015, and the unit 4 SCR was operating as of November 2016. In light of the uncertainty resulting from pending environmental regulation and the substantial estimated cost of the SCR installation, as of the date of this report, Idaho Power is assessing whether to move forward with the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger power plant. The expected capital expenditures in the table above do not include any estimated expenditures relating to the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2.\nBoardman-to-Hemingway Transmission Line: The Boardman-to-Hemingway line, a proposed 300-mile, 500-kV transmission project between a station near Boardman, Oregon, and the Hemingway station near Boise, Idaho, would provide transmission service to meet future resource needs. The Boardman-to-Hemingway line was included in the preferred resource portfolio in Idaho Power's 2015 IRP. In January 2012, Idaho Power entered into a joint funding agreement with PacifiCorp and the Bonneville Power Administration to pursue permitting of the project. The joint funding agreement provides that Idaho Power's interest in the permitting phase of the project would be approximately 21 percent, and that during future negotiations relating to construction of the transmission line Idaho Power would seek to retain that percentage interest in the completed project. Assuming both other participants fund their full share of the total cost of the permitting phase of the project, Idaho Power's estimated share of the cost of the permitting phase of the project is approximately $44 million, including Idaho Power's AFUDC. Total cost estimates for the project are between $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, including AFUDC. This cost estimate excludes the impacts of inflation and price changes of materials and labor resources that may occur following the date of the estimate. Idaho Power's share of the permitting phase of the project (excluding AFUDC) is included in the capital requirements table above in addition to approximately $45 million of Idaho Power's share of costs related to early construction efforts primarily included in the periods 2019-2021. These preliminary estimates of Idaho Power's share of early construction costs could significantly change as the construction timeline nears and as the project participants further align on future activities and estimates.\nApproximately $87 million has been expended on the Boardman-to-Hemingway project through December 31, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the joint funding arrangements, Idaho Power has received approximately $42 million of that amount as reimbursement from the project participants as of December 31, 2016. Idaho Power has accrued in receivables approximately $16 million more that will be billed by Idaho Power in the future to the project participants for expenses Idaho Power has incurred, for a total amount reimbursable by joint permitting participants of $58 million. In addition to the $58 million amount, $6 million is subject to reimbursement at a later date from the joint permitting participants, assuming their continued participation in the project, for expenses Idaho Power incurred prior to execution of the joint funding arrangements. Joint permitting participants are obligated to reimburse Idaho Power for their share of any future project permitting expenditures incurred by Idaho Power. Idaho Power plans to seek recovery of its share of project costs through the regulatory process.\nThe permitting phase of the Boardman-to-Hemingway project is subject to federal review and approval by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the U.S. Forest Service, the Department of the Navy, the Army Corps of Engineers, and certain other federal agencies. The BLM, as the lead federal agency on the National Environmental Policy Act review, issued a final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the project on November 25, 2016. As of the date of this report, the BLM's schedule provides for the issuance of a record of decision in 2017. In the separate Oregon state permitting process, Idaho Power expects its amended preliminary application for site certificate to be deemed complete by the Oregon Department of Energy in 2017. Idaho Power is unable to determine an in-service date for the line but, given the status of ongoing permitting activities, expects the in-service date would be in 2023 or beyond.\nGateway West Transmission Line: Idaho Power and PacifiCorp are pursuing the joint development of the Gateway West project, a 500-kV transmission project between a station located near Douglas, Wyoming and the Hemingway station. In January 2012, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp entered a joint funding agreement for permitting of the project. Idaho Power's estimated cost for the permitting phase of the Gateway West project is approximately $60 million, including AFUDC. Idaho Power has expended approximately $32 million on the permitting phase of the project through December 31, 2016. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates the total cost for its share of the project (including both permitting and construction) to be between $200 million and $400 million, including AFUDC. Idaho Power's share of the permitting phase of the project (excluding AFUDC) is included in the capital requirements table above in addition to approximately $35 million of Idaho Power's share of costs related to early construction efforts primarily in the periods 2019-2021. These preliminary estimates of Idaho Power's share of early construction costs could significantly change as the construction timeline nears and as the project participants further align on future activities and estimates.\nThe permitting phase of the Gateway West project is subject to review and approval of the BLM. The BLM released its record of decision in November 2013 for eight of the ten transmission line segments. On January 20, 2017, the BLM released its record of decision for the remaining two transmission line segments. In September 2016, the U.S. Department of Interior Board of Land Appeals affirmed the BLM's November 2013 record of decision, which was challenged by certain third-parties. In February 2017, the State of Idaho and others filed with the U.S. Department of Interior Board of Land Appeals notices of appeal and requests for a stay of the BLM's record of decision.\nHells Canyon Complex Relicensing: The HCC, located on the Snake River where it forms the border between Idaho and Oregon, provides approximately 68 percent of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating nameplate capacity and 32 percent of its total generating nameplate capacity. Idaho Power has been engaged in the process of obtaining from the FERC a new long-term license for the HCC. The past and anticipated future costs associated with obtaining a new long-term license for the HCC are significant. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates that the annual costs it will incur to obtain a new long-term license for the HCC, including AFUDC but excluding costs expected to be incurred for complying with the license after issuance, are likely to range from $25 million to $35 million until issuance of the license, which Idaho Power estimates will occur no earlier than 2021. Idaho Power expects that the annual capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses associated with compliance with the terms and conditions of the long-term license could also be substantial, but the company is currently unable to estimate those costs in light of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate terms and conditions that may be included in the license. Idaho Power intends to seek recovery of those relicensing and compliance costs in rates through the regulatory process. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for additional details relating to the relicensing process.\nEnvironmental Regulation Costs: Idaho Power anticipates that it will incur significant expenditures for the installation of environmental controls at its coal-fired plants and for its hydroelectric relicensing efforts. The near-term cost estimates for environmental matters are summarized in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business\" of this report. The capital portion of these amounts is included in the Capital Requirements table above but does not include costs related to possible changes in current or new environmental laws or regulations and enforcement policies that may be enacted in response to issues such as climate change and emissions from coal-fired and gas-fired generation plants.\nLong-Term Resource Planning: The IPUC and OPUC require that Idaho Power prepare biennially an IRP. Idaho Power filed its most recent IRP in June 2015 and expects to file its 2017 IRP in June 2017. The IRP seeks to forecast Idaho Power's loads and resources for a 20-year period, analyzes potential supply-side and demand-side resource options, and identifies potential near-term and long-term actions. The 2015 IRP included as near-term action items the continued permitting and planning for the Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission line and further investigation of the early retirement of the North Valmy power plant in collaboration with the plant's co-owner. Idaho Power filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC in October and November 2016, respectively, requesting accelerated depreciation of the North Valmy plant in connection with the potential early closure of the plant, which remain pending. The near-term action plan also included commencement of an economic evaluation of environmental control retrofits for units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger power plant. Additional information on Idaho Power's 2015 IRP and 2017 IRP is included in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business - Resource Planning\" in this report.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Contributions and Recovery\nIdaho Power contributed $40 million, $39 million, and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plan in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Idaho Power estimates that it has no minimum contribution requirement for 2017, though it plans to contribute between $20 million and $40 million to the pension plan during 2017. Idaho Power's contributions are made in a continued effort to balance the regulatory collection of these expenditures with the amount and timing of contributions to mitigate the cost of being in an underfunded position. In 2017 and beyond, Idaho Power expects continuing significant contribution obligations under the pension plan. Refer to Note 11 - \"Benefit Plans\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and the section titled \"Contractual Obligations\" below in this MD&A for information relating to those obligations.\nIdaho Power defers its Idaho-jurisdiction pension expense as a regulatory asset until recovered from Idaho customers. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power's deferral balance associated with the Idaho jurisdiction was $105 million. Deferred pension costs are expected to be amortized to expense to match the revenues received when contributions are recovered through rates. Idaho Power only records a carrying charge on the unrecovered balance of cash contributions. The IPUC has authorized Idaho Power to recover and amortize $17 million of deferred pension costs annually, and has applied $68 million against the deferred amount under its Idaho sharing mechanisms since 2011. The primary impact of pension contributions is on the timing of cash flows, as cost recovery lags behind the timing of contributions.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents IDACORP's and Idaho Power's contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2016, for the respective periods in which they are due:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future interest payments(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cogeneration and small power production(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel supply agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement benefit plans(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) For additional information, see Note 4 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Future interest payments are calculated based on the assumption that all debt is outstanding until maturity.

Other purchase obligations also includes Idaho Power's estimated proportionate funding obligation for goods and services under non-fuel purchase agreements at its jointly-owned generation facilities. In some instances, Idaho Power is not a direct party to an underlying purchase agreement, but is obligated under the instruments governing the joint ventures to reimburse the co-owner for payments the co-owner makes pursuant to the purchase agreement. Those estimated amounts have been included in the table above.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5) Idaho Power estimates pension contributions based on actuarial data.

For more information on pension and postretirement plans, refer to Note 11 - \"Benefit Plans\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividends\nThe amount and timing of dividends paid on IDACORP's common stock are within the discretion of IDACORP's board of directors. IDACORP's board of directors reviews the dividend rate periodically to determine its appropriateness in light of IDACORP's current and long-term financial position and results of operations, capital requirements, rating agency considerations, contractual and regulatory restrictions, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and Idaho Power in particular, competitive conditions, and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant. The ability of IDACORP to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power.\nIDACORP has a dividend policy that provides for a target long-term dividend payout ratio of between 50 and 60 percent of sustainable IDACORP earnings, with the flexibility to achieve that payout ratio over time and to adjust the payout ratio or to deviate from the target payout ratio from time to time based on the various factors that drive IDACORP's board of directors' dividend decisions. Notwithstanding the dividend policy adopted by IDACORP's board of directors, the dividends IDACORP pays remain in the discretion of the board of directors who, when evaluating the dividend amount, will continue to take into account the factors above, among others. In September of 2014, 2015, and 2016, IDACORP's board of directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share, $0.51 per share, and $0.55 per share of IDACORP common stock, respectively. IDACORP's dividends during 2016 were 53 percent of actual 2016 earnings.\nFor additional information relating to IDACORP and Idaho Power dividends, including restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends, see Note 6 - Common Stock\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nContingencies and Proceedings\nIDACORP and Idaho Power are involved in a number of litigation, alternative dispute resolution, and administrative proceedings, and are subject to claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, that could affect their future results of operations and financial condition. In many instances IDACORP and Idaho Power are unable to predict the outcomes of the matters or estimate the impact the proceedings may have on their financial positions, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIdaho Power is also actively monitoring various environmental regulations that may have a significant impact on its future operations. Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing, and compliance plans for these environmental matters, Idaho Power is unable to determine the financial impact of potential new regulations but does believe that future capital investment for infrastructure and modifications to its electric generating facilities to comply with these regulations could be significant.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough a self-bonding mechanism, Idaho Power guarantees its portion of reclamation activities and obligations at BCC, of which IERCo owns a one-third interest. This guarantee, which is renewed annually with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, was $71 million at December 31, 2016, representing IERCo's one-third share of BCC's total reclamation obligation of $212 million. BCC has a reclamation trust fund set aside specifically for the purpose of paying these reclamation costs. At December 31, 2016, the value of the reclamation trust fund totaled $78 million. During 2016, the reclamation trust fund distributed approximately $6 million for reclamation activity costs associated with the BCC surface mine. BCC periodically assesses the adequacy of the reclamation trust fund and its estimate of future reclamation costs. To ensure that the reclamation trust fund maintains adequate reserves, BCC adds a per-ton surcharge to coal sales. Because of the existence of the fund and the ability to apply a per-ton surcharge, the estimated fair value of this guarantee is minimal.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nIntroduction\nIdaho Power's regulatory strategy takes into consideration short-term and long-term needs for rate relief and involves several factors that can affect the timing of rate filings. These factors include, among others, in-service dates of major capital investments, the timing of changes in major revenue and expense items, and customer growth rates. Idaho Power's most recent general rate cases in Idaho and Oregon were filed during 2011, and Idaho Power filed a large single-issue rate case for the Langley Gulch power plant in Idaho and Oregon in 2012. These significant rate cases resulted in the resetting of base rates in both Idaho and Oregon during 2012. Idaho Power also reset its base-rate power supply expenses in the Idaho jurisdiction for purposes of updating the collection of costs through retail rates in 2014, but without a resulting net increase in rates. Between general rate cases, Idaho Power relies upon customer growth, power cost adjustment mechanisms, tariff riders, and other mechanisms to reduce the impact of regulatory lag, which refers to the period of time between making an investment or incurring an expense and recovering that investment or expense and earning a return. Management's regulatory focus in recent years has been largely on regulatory settlement stipulations and the design of rate mechanisms. During 2017, Idaho Power plans to continue to assess its need to file, and timing of, a general rate case in its two retail jurisdictions, based on its consideration of the factors described above.\nNotable Retail Rate Changes in Idaho and Oregon\nIncluded in the table that follows are notable regulatory developments during 2014, 2015, and 2016 that affected Idaho Power's results for the periods. Also refer to Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of regulatory mechanism and associated orders of the IPUC and OPUC, which should be read in conjunction with the discussion of regulatory matters in this MD&A.\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Annualized Revenue Impact (millions)(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014 Idaho FCA(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014 Idaho PCA(2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transfer of power supply costs from the Idaho PCA mechanism to Idaho base rates(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 Idaho FCA(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 Idaho PCA(2)(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 Idaho FCA(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 Idaho PCA(2)(6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) The annual amount collected in rates is typically not recovered on a linear basis (i.e., 1/12th per month), and is instead recovered in proportion to general business sales volumes.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) The rate changes for the Idaho PCA and FCA are applicable only for one-year periods.

In the general rate case, the IPUC issued an order approving a settlement stipulation that provided for an overall 7.86 percent authorized rate of return on an Idaho-jurisdiction rate base of approximately $2.36 billion. The settlement stipulation resulted in a $34.0 million overall increase in Idaho Power's annual Idaho-jurisdictional base rate revenues. Neither the IPUC's order nor the settlement stipulation specified an authorized rate of return on equity.\nEffective March 1, 2012, Idaho Power implemented new Oregon base rates resulting from its receipt of an order from the OPUC approving a settlement stipulation in its general rate case proceedings that provided for a $1.8 million base rate revenue increase, a rate of return on equity of 9.9 percent, and an overall rate of return of 7.757 percent in the Oregon jurisdiction.\nIdaho and Oregon base rates were subsequently adjusted again in 2012, in connection with Idaho Power's completion of the Langley Gulch power plant. In June 2012, the IPUC issued an order approving a $58.1 million increase in annual Idaho-jurisdiction base rate revenues, effective July 1, 2012, for inclusion of the investment and associated costs of the plant in rates. The order also provided for a $335.9 million increase in Idaho rate base. On September 20, 2012, the OPUC issued an order approving a $3.0 million increase in annual Oregon jurisdiction base rate revenues, effective October 1, 2012, for inclusion of the investment and associated costs of the plant in Oregon rates.\nIn March 2014, the IPUC issued an order approving Idaho Power's application requesting an increase of approximately $106 million in the normalized or \"base level\" net power supply expense on a total-system basis to be used to update base rates and in the determination of the PCA rate that became effective June 1, 2014. Approval of the order removed the Idaho-jurisdictional portion of those expenses (approximately $99 million) from collection via the PCA mechanism and instead results in collecting that portion through base rates.\nNon-Base Rate Idaho Regulatory Settlement Stipulations\nSettlement Stipulation for 2012 to 2014: In December 2011, the IPUC issued an order, separate from the then-pending Idaho general rate case proceeding, approving a settlement stipulation that allowed Idaho Power to, in certain circumstances, amortize additional ADITC if Idaho Power's actual Idaho ROE for 2012, 2013, or 2014 was less than 9.5 percent, to help achieve a 9.5 percent Idaho ROE for the applicable year. The more specific terms and conditions of the December 2011 Idaho settlement stipulation are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters - Notable Idaho Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Under the December 2011 settlement stipulation, when Idaho Power's actual Idaho ROE for any of those years exceeded 10.0 percent, Idaho Power was required to share a portion of its Idaho-jurisdiction earnings with Idaho customers.\nSettlement Stipulation for 2015 to 2019: In October 2014, the IPUC issued an order approving an extension, with modifications, of the terms of the December 2011 settlement stipulation for the period from 2015 through 2019, or until the terms are otherwise modified or terminated by order of the IPUC or the full $45 million of additional ADITC contemplated by the settlement stipulation has been amortized. The more specific terms and conditions of the October 2014 settlement stipulation are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters - Notable Idaho Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. IDACORP and Idaho Power believe that the terms allowing amortization of additional ADITC in the October 2014 settlement stipulation provide the companies with a greater degree of earnings stability than would be possible without the terms of the stipulation in effect.\nIn 2016, Idaho Power's Idaho ROE was between 9.5 and 10.0 percent, and thus Idaho Power recorded no additional ADITC amortization and no provision for sharing with customers. Accordingly, at December 31, 2016, the full $45 million of additional ADITC remains available for future use under the terms of the settlement stipulation.\nIdaho Power recorded the following for sharing with customers under the December 2011 and October 2014 Idaho Settlement Stipulations (in millions):\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded as Refunds to Customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded as a Pre-tax Charge to Pension Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$14.6\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nModifications to Idaho Annual Rate Adjustment Mechanisms\nPCA Mechanism: In July 2014, the IPUC opened a docket pursuant to which Idaho Power, the IPUC Staff, and other interested parties evaluated Idaho Power's application of the true-up component of the PCA mechanism. The July 2014 docket arose from a prior order of the IPUC, which noted that the IPUC Staff believed that Idaho Power's application of the true-up component introduced a line-loss bias that inflated the true-up revenue that Idaho Power collects under the PCA. In May 2015, the IPUC approved a settlement stipulation that modified the calculation of the true-up component of the PCA mechanism. The mechanics of the PCA mechanism and the terms of the PCA settlement stipulation are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nFCA Mechanism:Also in July 2014, the IPUC opened a docket to allow Idaho Power, the IPUC Staff, and other interested parties to further evaluate the IPUC Staff's concerns regarding the application of the FCA. Concerns cited included the application of weather-normalization, the customer count methodology, the rate adjustment cap, cross-subsidization issues, and whether the FCA is in fact effectively removing Idaho Power's disincentive to aggressively pursue energy efficiency programs.\nThe FCA is designed to remove Idaho Power's financial disincentive to invest in energy efficiency programs by separating (or decoupling) the recovery of fixed costs from the variable kilowatt-hour charge and linking it instead to a set amount per customer. Stated generally, under the FCA Idaho Power charges residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less \"actual fixed costs per customer\" than the base level of fixed costs that the IPUC authorized for recovery through rates in the last general rate case, and Idaho Power credits those customers when its \"actual fixed costs per customer\" recovered exceed that base level of fixed costs. The FCA is adjusted each year to collect, or refund, the difference between the authorized fixed-cost recovery amount and the actual fixed costs recovered by Idaho Power during the year.\nIn years when actual sales per customer are higher than weather-normalized sales due to high summer or low winter temperatures, Idaho Power expects that the new FCA methodology will be less favorable to Idaho Power than the prior methodology. Conversely, Idaho Power expects that the new FCA methodology will be more favorable to Idaho Power in years when actual sales per customer are lower than weather normalized sales due to cooler summer or warmer winter temperatures.\nDeferred Net Power Supply Costs\nDeferred power supply costs represent certain differences between Idaho Power's actual net power supply costs and the costs included in its retail rates, the latter being based on annual forecasts of power supply costs. Deferred power supply costs are recorded on the balance sheets for future recovery or refund through customer rates. Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions provide for annual adjustments to the rates charged to retail customers. The power cost adjustment mechanisms and associated financial impacts are described in \"Results of Operations\" in this MD&A and in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nFactors that have influenced power cost adjustment rate changes in recent years include year-to-year volatility in hydroelectric generation conditions, market energy prices and the volume of off-system sales, power purchase costs from renewable energy projects, and revenue sharing under Idaho regulatory settlement stipulations. From year to year, these factors can vary significantly, which can result in significant accruals and deferrals under the power cost adjustment mechanisms. The power cost adjustment rate changes reflected in the table under the heading \"Notable Retail Rate Changes in Idaho and Oregon\" are illustrative of the volatility of net power supply costs and the impact on power cost adjustment rates.\nAs noted above under the heading \"Idaho and Oregon General Rate Cases and Base Rate Adjustments,\" in light of the existence of permanent increases in power supply costs, in March 2014 the IPUC issued an order approving Idaho Power's application requesting recovery of a portion of its ongoing power supply costs through base rates rather than through the PCA mechanism.\nThe following table summarizes the change in deferred net power supply costs over the prior two years.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Oregon(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current period net power supply costs deferred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue sharing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,999\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,999\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy efficiency rider funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior amounts recovered through rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,519\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,294\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SO2 allowance and renewable energy certificate (REC) sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current period net power supply costs deferred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue sharing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy efficiency rider funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior amounts recovered through rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,818\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SO2 allowance and renewable energy certificate (REC) sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(915\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>683\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Oregon power supply cost deferrals are subject to a statute that specifically limits rate amortizations of deferred costs to six percent of gross Oregon revenue per year (approximately $3 million).

Idaho Power can defer costs incurred until the earlier of when Idaho Power requests recovery of the costs and the deferral balance or the end of 2018. Idaho Power anticipates that it will begin participating in the Western EIM in the spring of 2018. The Western EIM is intended to reduce the power supply costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, to integrate intermittent power from renewable generation sources more effectively, and to enhance reliability. Refer to Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to Idaho Power's anticipated participation in the Western EIM.\nOpen Access Transmission Tariff Rate Proceedings\nIdaho Power uses a formula rate for transmission service provided under its OATT, which allows transmission rates to be updated annually based primarily on financial and operational data Idaho Power files with the FERC. In August 2016, Idaho Power filed its 2016 final transmission rate with the FERC, reflecting a transmission rate of $25.52 per kW-year, to be effective for the period from October 1, 2016, to September 30, 2017. Idaho Power's final rate was based on a net annual transmission revenue requirement of $127.4 million. Historic OATT rate information is included in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nTransmission Revenues Associated with Asset Exchange Transaction\nEffective in October 2015, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp each transferred to the other certain interests in transmission-related equipment. In connection with that transaction, the companies terminated or amended a number of long-term agreements between Idaho Power and PacifiCorp related to the ownership and operation of transmission-related equipment and transmission services. In 2014, Idaho Power collected approximately $8 million in transmission revenues under long-term transmission agreements that were terminated in connection with the asset exchange transaction. As a result of the transaction and termination of those long-term transmission agreements, Idaho Power's OATT rate increased; however, in accordance with a FERC order, the current formula rate methodology will phase in the increase over a two-year period from October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2018.\nIn compliance with the IPUC's order approving the asset exchange transaction, Idaho Power submitted to the IPUC a request for verification that its regulatory accounting method reflecting a symmetrical tracking of changes in transmission revenues resulting specifically from the asset exchange with PacifiCorp complies with the IPUC's order. As an alternative proposed by Idaho Power to its symmetrical tracking, in August 2016, the IPUC ordered that any changes in transmission revenues resulting from the asset exchange will be addressed, prospectively, in Idaho Power's next general rate case.\nDepreciation Rate Requests\nIn October and November 2016, Idaho Power filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC, respectively, requesting authorization to (a) accelerate depreciation for the North Valmy coal-fired power plant, to allow the plant to be fully depreciated by December 31, 2025, (b) establish a balancing account to track the incremental costs and benefits associated with the accelerated depreciation date, and (c) adjust customer rates to recover the associated incremental annual levelized revenue requirement in an aggregate amount of $29.6 million. Idaho Power also filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC requesting approval to institute revised depreciation rates for Idaho Power's other electric plant-in-service and adjust base rates by an aggregate of $7.4 million to reflect the revised depreciation rates applied to electric plant-in-service balances subject to the most recent general rate case. The depreciation filings are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRelicensing of Hydroelectric Projects\nOverview: Idaho Power, like other utilities that operate non-federal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways, obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the FERC. These licenses have a term of 30 to 50 years depending on the size, complexity, and cost of the project. The expiration dates for the FERC licenses for each of the facilities are included in Part I - Item 2 - \"Properties\" in this report. Costs for the relicensing of Idaho Power's hydroelectric projects are recorded in construction work in progress until a new multi-year license is issued by the FERC, at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service. Idaho Power will submit relicensing costs and costs related to new licenses to regulators for recovery\nthrough the ratemaking process and, in December 2016, submitted a request for a determination of prudency, which is described below. As of December 31, 2016, relicensing costs of $249 million for the HCC, Idaho Power's largest hydroelectric complex and a major relicensing effort, were included in construction work in progress. As of the date of this report, the IPUC authorizes Idaho Power to include in its Idaho jurisdiction rates approximately $6.5 million annually ($10.7 million when grossed-up for the effect of income taxes) of AFUDC relating to the HCC relicensing project. Collecting these amounts now will reduce the amount collected in the future once the HCC relicensing costs are approved for recovery in base rates. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power's regulatory liability for collection of AFUDC relating to the HCC was $103 million. In addition to the discussion below, refer to \"Environmental Matters\" in this MD&A for a discussion of environmental compliance under FERC licenses for Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating plants.\nHells Canyon Complex: The HCC, located on the Snake River where it forms the border between Idaho and Oregon, provides approximately 68 percent of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating nameplate capacity and 32 percent of its total generating nameplate capacity. In July 2003, Idaho Power filed an application with the FERC for a new license in anticipation of the July 2005 expiration of the then-existing license. Since the expiration of that license, Idaho Power has been operating the project under annual licenses issued by the FERC. In December 2004, Idaho Power and eleven other parties, including National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), involved in the HCC relicensing process entered into an interim agreement that addresses the effects of the ongoing operations of the HCC on Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed species pending the relicensing of the project. In August 2007, the FERC Staff issued a final EIS for the HCC, which the FERC will use to determine whether, and under what conditions, to issue a new license for the project. The purpose of the final EIS is to inform the FERC, federal and state agencies, Native American tribes, and the public about the environmental effects of Idaho Power's operation of the HCC. Certain portions of the final EIS involve issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and formal consultations under the ESA, which remain unresolved.\nIn connection with its relicensing efforts, Idaho Power has filed water quality certification applications, required under Section 401 of the CWA, with the states of Idaho and Oregon requesting that each state certify that any discharges from the project comply with applicable state water quality standards. Section 401 of the CWA requires that a state either approve or deny a Section 401 water quality certification application within one year of the filing of the application or the state may be considered to have waived its certification authority under the CWA. As a consequence, Idaho Power has been filing and withdrawing its Section 401 certification applications with Oregon and Idaho on an annual basis while it has been working with the states to identify measures that will provide reasonable assurance that discharges from the HCC will adequately address applicable water quality standards. In the 2016 Section 401 certification application process, Oregon required Idaho Power to comply with fish passage and reintroduction conditions. Idaho's water quality certification, however, specifically forbids Idaho Power from reintroducing certain fish protected under the ESA, into Idaho's waters. On November 30, 2016, Idaho Power filed a petition with the FERC requesting that the FERC resolve the conflict between Oregon's and Idaho's conditions and declare that the FPA pre-empts the Oregon state law. In January 2017, the FERC issued an order denying Idaho Power's petition, stating that the petition for a declaratory order was premature, cannot realistically be considered separately from the issue of the states' certification authority under the CWA Section 401, and raises issues that are beyond the FERC's authority to decide. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power is considering other actions it may take to obtain a resolution of the issue.\nIn September 2007, in connection with the issuance of its final EIS, the FERC notified the NMFS and the USFWS of its determination that the licensing of the HCC was likely to adversely affect ESA-listed species, including the bull trout and fall Chinook salmon and steelhead, under the NMFS's and USFWS's jurisdiction and requested that the NMFS and USFWS initiate formal consultation under Section 7 of the ESA on the licensing of the HCC. Each of the NMFS and USFWS responded to the FERC that the conditions relating to the licensing of the HCC were not fully described or developed in the final EIS as the measures to address the water quality effects of the project were yet to be fully defined by the Section 401 certification process. The NMFS and USFWS therefore recommended that formal consultation under the ESA be delayed until the Section 401 certification process is completed.\nIdaho Power continues to work with Idaho and Oregon in the development of measures to provide reasonable assurance that any discharges from the HCC will comply with applicable state water quality standards so that appropriate water quality certifications can be issued for the project, and continues to cooperate with the USFWS, NMFS, and the FERC in an effort to address ESA concerns. Idaho Power has begun the process for construction of new aerated runners at the Brownlee project (part of the HCC) at an estimated cost of $50 million. The first of four units was installed in 2016 and Idaho Power plans to install one unit in each year from 2017 through 2019. Other measures that have been proposed or considered have included modification of spillways at two dams in the HCC to address total dissolved gas issues, and upstream watershed improvements or the installation of a temperature control structure to address water temperatures during a small portion of the year. If Idaho Power is required to take these or other additional measures to satisfy relicensing requirements, it could add substantially to\nproject costs. Idaho Power continues to work with the Oregon and Idaho Departments of Environmental Quality on the water quality certification issue and the water quality measures that will be required to obtain 401 certification.\nAs of the date of this report, Idaho Power is unable to predict the timing of issuance by the FERC of any license order or the ultimate capital investment and ongoing operating and maintenance costs Idaho Power will incur in complying with any new license. However, as of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates that the annual costs it will incur to obtain a new long-term license for the HCC, including AFUDC but excluding costs expected to be incurred for complying with the license after issuance, are likely to range from $25 million to $35 million until issuance of the license, which Idaho Power estimates will occur no earlier than 2021. In light of the costs incurred and the considerable passage of time, in December 2016, Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC requesting a determination that Idaho Power's expenditures of $220.8 million through year-end 2015 on relicensing of the HCC were prudently incurred, and thus eligible for future inclusion in retail rates.\nRenewable Energy Standards and Contracts\nRenewable Portfolio Standards: Numerous proponents have introduced legislation in the U.S. Congress that would require electric utilities to obtain a specified percentage of their electricity from renewable sources, commonly referred to as a \"renewable portfolio standard\" or \"RPS.\" However, as of the date of this report no federal or State of Idaho RPS is in effect. Idaho Power will be required to comply with a five- or ten-percent RPS in Oregon beginning in 2025 (depending on loads at that time), and Idaho Power expects to meet either RPS requirement with Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) obtained from the purchase of power from the Elkhorn Valley wind project.\nPursuant to an IPUC order, Idaho Power is selling its near-term RECs and returning to customers their share (shared 95% with customers in the Idaho jurisdiction) of those proceeds through the PCA. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, Idaho Power's REC sales totaled $1.0 million, $1.8 million, and $3.2 million, respectively. The comparative decrease in REC sales resulted primarily from the elimination of a REC purchase and sale agreement with a third party.\nWere Idaho Power to be subject to additional RPS legislation, it may cease in full or in part the sale of RECs it receives, seek to obtain RECs from additional projects, generate RECs from any REC-generating facilities it owns or may be required to construct in light of an RPS, or purchase RECs in the market. Historically, Idaho Power has generally not received the RECs associated with PURPA projects. However, an order issued by the IPUC in December 2012, described below, provides that Idaho Power will own a portion of the RECs generated by some PURPA projects. The required purchase of additional RECs to meet RPS requirements would increase Idaho Power's costs, which Idaho Power expects would be wholly or largely passed on to customers through rates and the power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nRenewable and Other Energy Contracts: Idaho Power has contracts for the purchase of power from both CSPP projects under PURPA and non-CSPP renewable generation sources such as biomass, wind, solar, small hydroelectric projects, and two geothermal projects. Idaho Power purchases wind power from both CSPP and non-CSPP facilities, including its largest non-CSPP wind power project-the Elkhorn Valley wind project with a 101-MW nameplate capacity. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power had contracts to purchase energy from 117 on-line CSPP projects, twelve additional projects expected to come on-line in 2017, and three projects expected to come on-line in 2019. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016, the resource type and nameplate capacity of Idaho Power's signed CSPP and non-CSPP related agreements. These agreements have original contract terms ranging from one to 35 years.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resource Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total On-line (MW)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Began operating during 2016 (MW)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Under Contract but not yet On-line (MW)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Projects under Contract (MW)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CSPP:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wind\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Solar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hydroelectric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CSPP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,132\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-CSPP:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wind\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Geothermal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-CSPP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll but three of the projects not yet on-line are expected to be on-line no later than mid-year 2017 (three solar projects are scheduled to be on-line in 2019).\nIn April 2015, Idaho Power made filings with the OPUC requesting, among other things, a reduction in the term of standard PURPA power purchase agreements from 20 years to two years for projects above 100 kW, in a manner consistent with its Idaho jurisdiction where the IPUC reduced the length of PURPA contracts that involve avoided-cost-based pricing to two years, and a temporary suspension of Idaho Power's obligation to enter into new fixed-price standard PURPA agreements during the pendency of the proceedings. In March 2016, the OPUC issued an order permanently reducing the eligibility cap for solar project standard contracts to 3 MW, with all other resource types retaining an eligibility cap of 10 MW. In its order, the OPUC retained the requirement for up to 20-year contract lengths for Oregon jurisdictional projects, comprised of 15 years of fixed prices and five years of market index prices.\nIn June 2016, the FERC held a technical conference on implementation issues under PURPA, including the mandatory power purchase obligation and the methods for determining avoided costs for those purchases. The conference also involved a discussion of PURPA project siting issues and minimum contract term lengths. In September 2016, the FERC filed a notice inviting post-technical conference comments on (1) the use of the \"one-mile rule\" to determine the size of an entity seeking certification as a small power production qualifying facility and (2) minimum standards for PURPA-purchase contracts. In November 2016, Idaho Power provided comments to the FERC specifically addressing Idaho Power's position regarding the two items of which the FERC invited comments. Idaho Power is unable to predict what policy or rulemaking actions or proceedings, if any, on PURPA-related issues will result from the technical conference.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nOverview\nIdaho Power is subject to a broad range of federal, state, regional, and local laws and regulations designed to protect, restore, and enhance the environment, including the CAA, the CWA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and the ESA, among other laws. These laws are administered by a number of federal, state, and local agencies. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and associated costs, these laws and regulations provide authority to regulators to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, injunctive relief, and other sanctions. Idaho Power's three co-owned coal-fired power plants and three natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants are subject to many of these regulations. Idaho Power's 17 hydroelectric projects are also further subject to a number of water discharge standards and other environmental requirements.\nCompliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may:\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increase the operating costs of generating plants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increase the construction costs and lead time for new facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>require the modification of existing generating plants, which could result in additional costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>require the curtailment or shut-down of existing generating plants; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reduce the output from current generating facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrent and future environmental laws and regulations will increase the cost of operating fossil fuel-fired generation plants and constructing new generation and transmission facilities, in large part through the substantial cost of permitting activities and the required installation of additional pollution control devices. In many parts of the United States, some higher-cost, high-emission coal-fired plants have ceased operation or the plant owners have announced a near-term cessation of operation, as the cost of compliance makes the plants uneconomical to operate. The decision to agree to cease operation of the Boardman coal-fired plant, in which Idaho Power owns a 10 percent interest, by the end of 2020, was based in part on the significant future cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC and OPUC in October and November 2016, respectively, requesting accelerated depreciation of the North Valmy plant in connection with the potential early closure of the plant. Additionally, in light of the uncertainty resulting from pending environmental regulation and the substantial estimated cost of SCR controls, Idaho Power is assessing whether to move forward with the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant.\nIn addition to increasing costs generally, these environmental laws and regulations could affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition if the costs associated with these environmental requirements and early plant retirements cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis. Part I, Item 1 - Business - Utility Operations - Environmental Regulation and Costs\u201d in this report includes a summary of Idaho Power's expected capital and operating expenditures for environmental matters during the period from 2017 to 2019. Given the uncertainty of future environmental regulations and technological advances, Idaho Power is unable to predict its environmental-related expenditures beyond 2019, though they could be substantial. Furthermore, the recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation, and government policy regarding environmental matters. Idaho Power may delay making operational changes or environmental-related expenditures while such changes are pending to avoid implementing uncertain laws, rules, and policies.\nEndangered Species Act Matters\nOverview: The listing of a species of fish, wildlife, or plants as threatened or endangered under the ESA may have an adverse impact on Idaho Power's ability to construct generation, transmission, or distribution facilities or relicense or operate its hydroelectric facilities. When a species is added to the federal list of threatened and endangered species, it is protected from take,\u201d which is defined to include harming the species. The ESA directs that, concurrent with a designation of a threatened or endangered species, and where prudent and determinable, the applicable agencies also designate any habitat of such species which is then considered to be critical habitat.\u201d The ESA also provides that each federal agency must ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat. If an action is determined to result in adverse modification of critical habitat, the federal agency must adopt changes to the proposed action to avoid the adverse modification. These changes are often quite extensive and can affect the size, scope, and even the feasibility of a project moving forward. In February 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the NMFS issued a set of regulatory and policy changes relating to critical habitat and adverse modification determinations under the ESA. While the ultimate impact of implementation of those changes is yet to be determined, taken as a whole, Idaho Power believes that the changes could result in the applicable agencies having greater authority in making designations of critical habitat and could increase the likelihood of adverse modification determinations.\nThe construction of generation, transmission, or distribution facilities and the relicensing of Idaho Power's hydroelectric projects can be federally authorized actions that fall under the ESA. There are a number of threatened or endangered species within Idaho Power's service area and within or near proposed transmission line routes, including the slickspot peppergrass. Further, there are a number of ESA-listed fish and other aquatic species located in waterways in which Idaho Power has hydroelectric facilities, including fall Chinook salmon, bull trout, Bliss Rapids snail, and Snake River physa snail. To date, efforts to protect these and other listed species have not significantly affected generation levels or operating costs at any of Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities. However, the ongoing relicensing of the HCC presents endangered species and fisheries issues that may require operational adjustments and could adversely impact the amount of output from hydroelectric dams, potentially causing Idaho Power to rely on more expensive sources for power generation or market purchases.\nDevelopments in Regulation of Sage Grouse Habitat: In February 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of Idaho challenging the BLM's sage grouse resource management and land use plan revisions that became effective in 2015 under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The lawsuit challenges the plans and associated environmental impact statements across the sage grouse range and alleges that the plans fail to ensure that sage grouse populations and habitats will be protected and restored in accordance with the best available science and legal mandates. Further, the complaint challenges certain exemptions provided for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects. Idaho Power has intervened in the proceedings in an effort to support the exemptions provided for in the BLM's plans.\nIn May 2016, a separate lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of North Dakota, challenging the BLM's sage grouse resource management and land use plan revisions, including the exemptions provided for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects. In October 2016, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to no longer challenge the exemptions; however, in December 2016, the North Dakota court transfered claims challenging certain Idaho land use plan amendments to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power is participating in the proceedings in an effort to protect its interests.\nESA Issues Related to Specific Projects:\nHells Canyon Relicensing Project: In 2007, the FERC requested initiation of formal consultation under the ESA with the NMFS and the USFWS regarding potential effects of HCC relicensing on several listed aquatic and terrestrial species. Formal consultation has yet to be initiated and the NMFS and the USFWS continue to gather and consider information relative to the effects of relicensing on relevant ESA listed species. Idaho Power continues to cooperate with the USFWS, the NMFS, and the FERC in an effort to address ESA concerns. In December 2004, Idaho Power and eleven other parties, including NMFS and the USFWS, entered into an interim agreement that addresses the effects of the ongoing operations of the HCC on ESA listed species pending the relicensing of the project. At the conclusion of formal consultation and with the issuance of biological opinions by the NMFS and the USFWS and an operating license by the FERC, Idaho Power may be required to implement additional measures or further modify or adjust operations to comply with Section 7 of the ESA. The issuance of a final biological opinion during 2017 is unlikely.\nBoardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West Transmission Projects: In August 2016, the USFWS re-instated the threatened species status of slickspot peppergrass. Most of the species are located on federal land. Idaho Power expects the listing of the slickspot peppergrass and its existence within or near the proposed routes for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects to continue to impact the cost and timing of permitting and construction of the projects, as it requires an ESA Section 7 consultation. The USFWS has also indicated it intends to designate critical habitat for the species. If critical habitat is designated within the vicinity of the transmission line projects, Idaho Power expects that the designation could increase the cost of obtaining permits for the projects and could further delay the in-service date of the projects.\nEndangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act Developments: In May 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon issued an opinion finding that in the context of hydroelectric facilities owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and located on the lower Snake River, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) violated the ESA by using improper standards, failing to consider adequately the impact of climate change on habitat conditions, and placing undue reliance on unproven, future federal habitat conservation measures, particularly to the degree that the success of the measures could be undermined by climate change. The court also found that other federal agencies violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by failing to prepare a comprehensive environmental impact statement on implementation of the conservation measures ordered by NOAA Fisheries, including analysis of the measures directed by NOAA Fisheries and other reasonable alternatives. The court's opinion and its emphasis on a climate change-driven analysis element, if generalized to other situations, could require ESA-driven avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation efforts to incorporate surplus measures to ensure species' protection, which could result in considerable increases in cost beyond the cost of additional analysis in the NEPA process. In September 2016, federal agencies initiated an environmental impact statement process to examine hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake River, which Idaho Power expects will take place over a five-year period. None of Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities are included in the studies.\nClimate Change and the Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nOverview: Long-term climate change could significantly affect Idaho Power's business in a variety of ways, including:\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in temperature and precipitation could affect customer demand and energy loads;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>extreme weather events could increase service interruptions, outages, maintenance costs, and the need for additional backup systems, and can affect the supply of, and demand for, electricity and natural gas, which may impact the price of those and other commodities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows could adversely affect hydroelectric generation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>legislative and/or regulatory developments related to climate change could affect plants and operations, including restrictions on the construction of new generation resources, the expansion of existing resources, or the operation of generation resources; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>consumer preference for, and resource planning decisions requiring, renewable or low GHG-emitting sources of energy could impact usage of existing generation sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission infrastructure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFederal and state regulations pertaining to GHG emissions under the CAA have raised uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels, most notably coal, as an economical energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities because many new technologies for reducing CO2 emissions from coal, including carbon capture and storage, are still in the development stage and are not yet proven. Stringent emissions standards could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, which may accelerate the retirement of coal-fired units and create power system reliability issues. Some higher-cost, high-emission coal-fired plants have ceased operation or the plant owners have announced a near-term cessation of operation, as the cost of compliance makes the plants uneconomical to operate, particularly in light of continued low natural gas prices that decrease the cost to operate natural gas-fired power plants.\nA variety of factors contribute to the financial, regulatory, and logistical uncertainties related to GHG reductions. These include the specific GHG emissions limits imposed, the timing of implementation of these limits, the level of emissions allowances allocated and the level that must be purchased, the purchase price of emissions allowances, the development and commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions, the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance, provisions for cost containment (if any), the impact on coal and natural gas prices, and the timing and amount of cost recovery through rates. Accordingly, Idaho Power cannot predict the effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of any GHG emission or other climate change requirements that may be adopted, although the costs to implement and comply with any such requirements could be substantial. A more detailed discussion of legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change follows.\nNational GHG Initiatives; Final Rule Under CAA Section 111(d): The EPA has become increasingly active in the regulation of GHGs. The EPA's endangerment finding in 2009 that GHGs threaten public health and welfare resulted in the enactment of a series of EPA regulations to address GHG emissions.\nIn May 2010, the EPA issued the Tailoring Rule,\u201d which set thresholds for GHG emissions that define when permits are required for new and existing industrial facilities. The final rule tailors\u201d the requirements of these CAA permitting programs to limit which facilities will be required to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permits. The rules require the use of \"best available control technology\" for GHG emissions if a new major source or modification of an existing major source is projected to result in GHG emissions of at least 75,000 tons per year (CO2 equivalent). In addition, Title V permit renewals or modifications for existing major sources must include applicable requirements relating to GHGs. While the rules are complex, Idaho Power believes that its owned and co-owned fossil fuel-fired generation plants are, as of the date of this report, in compliance with the GHG Tailoring Rule.\nIn June 2014, the EPA released, under Section 111(d) of the CAA, a proposed rule for addressing GHG from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs). The proposed rule was intended to achieve a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from the power sector by 2030. On August 3, 2015, the EPA released the final rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA, referred to as the Clean Power Plan, which requires states to adopt plans to collectively reduce 2005 levels of power sector CO2 emissions by 32 percent by the year 2030. The final rule provides states until September 2018 to submit implementation plans, phasing in several compliance periods beginning in 2022 and achieving the final emissions goals by 2030.\nOn February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order staying the implementation of the rule pending the completion of certain legal challenges, which has an uncertain impact on the ultimate timeline for implementation of the rule. Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generation facilities are in the states of Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming. Despite the current stay on implementation, Idaho Power is working with state representatives, neighboring utilities, and others as it analyzes the rule and prepares for compliance. Because the rule is premised on state implementation plans, the terms of which Idaho Power does not control, and due to the potential changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy with respect to environmental matters as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional elections, as of the date of this report Idaho Power is unable to determine the financial or operational impacts of the final rule.\nState GHG Initiatives and Idaho Power's Voluntary GHG Reduction Initiative: In August 2007, the Oregon legislature enacted legislation setting goals of reducing GHG levels to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 75 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Oregon imposes GHG emission reporting requirements on facilities emitting 2,500 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent annually. The Boardman coal-fired power plant located in Oregon, in which Idaho Power is a 10-percent owner, is subject to and in compliance with Oregon's GHG reporting requirements but is scheduled to cease coal-fired operations in 2020.\nIn Oregon, legislation referred to as the Oregon Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Plan was enacted in March 2016, and may require certain large Oregon utilities to remove coal-fired generation from their Oregon retail rates by 2030. Oregon utilities would be permitted to sell the output of coal-fired plants into the wholesale market or reallocate such plants to other states. To the extent Idaho Power is subject to the legislation, it plans to seek recovery, through the ratemaking process, of operating and capitalized costs related to its coal-fired generation assets and removal of any of those assets from Oregon rate base.\nThe State of Idaho has not passed legislation specifically regulating GHGs, but in May 2007, Idaho's governor issued Executive Order 2007-05, which directed the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to work with the state government to implement GHG reductions within each agency, complete a statewide emissions inventory, and provide recommendations to the governor, among other tasks. Wyoming and Nevada similarly have not enacted legislation to regulate GHG emissions and do not have a reporting requirement, but they are members of the Climate Registry, a national, voluntary GHG emission reporting system. The Climate Registry is a collaboration aimed at developing and managing a common GHG emission reporting system across states, provinces, and tribes to track GHG emissions nationally. All states for which Idaho Power has traditional fuel generating plants (i.e. Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming, and Nevada) are members of the Climate Registry. Idaho Power is engaged in voluntary GHG emissions intensity reduction efforts, which is discussed in Part I, Item 1 - Business - Utility Operations - Environmental Regulation and Costs.\"\nClean Air Act Matters\nOverview: In addition to the CAA developments related to GHG emissions described above, several other regulatory programs developed under the CAA apply to Idaho Power. These include the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), New Source Review / Prevention of Significant Deterioration (NSR/PSD)\nRules, and the Regional Haze Rule.\nMATS Implementation: The final MATS rule under the CAA, previously referred to as the Utility MACT Rule, was issued in February 2012. The final rule established emission limits for hazardous air pollutants from new and existing coal-fired and oil-fired steam electric generating units. The MATS rule provided that sources must be in compliance with emission limits by April 2015. Idaho Power and the plant co-owners have installed mercury continuous emission monitoring systems on all of the coal-fired units at the Jim Bridger, Boardman, and North Valmy coal-fired generating plants, along with control technology to reduce mercury, acid gases, and particulate matter emissions for purposes of compliance with the MATS rule. Idaho Power believes that as of the date of this report, the coal-fired plants are in compliance with the MATS rule. Legal challenges relating to the MATS rule, to which Idaho Power is not a party and pursuant to which the EPA is performing a court-mandated cost analysis for the rule, are pending.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards: The CAA requires the EPA to set ambient air quality standards for six \"criteria\" pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. These six pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. States are then required to develop emission reduction strategies through State Implementation Plans, or SIPs, based on attainment of these ambient air quality standards. Recent developments and pending actions related to certain of those items relevant to Idaho Power include the following:\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NOx: In 2010, the EPA adopted a new NAAQS for NOx at a level of 100 parts per billion averaged over a 1-hour period. In connection with the new NAAQS, in February 2012 the EPA issued a final rule designating all of the counties in Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming where Idaho Power owns or has an interest in a natural gas or coal-fired power plant as unclassifiable/attainment\u201d for NOx. The EPA indicated it would review the designations after 2015, when three years of air quality monitoring data are available, and may formally designate the counties as attainment or non-attainment for NOx. A designation of non-attainment may increase the likelihood that Idaho Power would be required to install costly pollution control technology at one or more of its plants.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>SO2: In 2010, the EPA adopted a new NAAQS for SO2 at a level of 75 parts per billion averaged over a one-hour period. In 2011, the states of Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming sent letters to the EPA recommending that all counties in these states be classified as \"unclassifiable\" under the new one-hour SO2 NAAQS because of a lack of definitive monitoring and modeling data. In February 2013, the EPA issued letters to the states of Idaho and Oregon, finding that the most recent air quality data for those states showed no violations of the 2010 SO2 standard. As a result, the EPA is waiting to propose designation actions for those states, and is likely to proceed with designation actions once additional data is gathered. Idaho Power expects that designations for Nevada and Wyoming will also be addressed in a separate future action.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Ozone: In late 2014, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would update the ozone standard under the CAA, from 75 parts per billion over an eight-hour period to 65 to 70 parts per billion over an eight-hour period. On October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the national ozone standard under the CAA to 70 parts per billion. The EPA stated that the vast majority of U.S. counties will meet the standards by 2025 with federal and state rules and programs now in place or underway. The EPA's plan provides for finalizing non-attainment designations in 2017, and it plans to propose rules and guidance over the next year to help states with potential non-attainment areas implement the revised standards. Non-attainment areas will have until 2020 to late 2037 to meet the new standard, with attainment dates varying based on the ozone level in the area. Due to high levels of background ozone, which can be caused by factors such as elevation, vegetation, wildfire, and international transport, attainment in areas within the Intermountain West may be difficult, and the formulation of state implementation plans to bring an area into compliance with the new standard may be challenging due to the existence of ozone caused by factors outside of local control. If the EPA were to make non-attainment determinations in areas where Idaho Power owns or co-owns power plants, or proposes to construct power plants, the state implementation plan for those areas could result in changes to the nature and frequency of operation of existing generation plants and make more difficult or costly the construction of new power generation plants. Idaho Power will seek to work with state regulators on implementation plans for any non-attainment areas, in an effort to reduce the potential adverse impact on Idaho Power's operation of its existing power generation plants and construction of future facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause the EPA has not yet completed the designation of areas as attaining or not attaining the NAAQS for NOx, SO2, and ozone, Idaho Power is unable to predict what impact the adoption and implementation of these standards may have on its operations, though it does expect at least some increases in capital and operating costs from the standards if areas in which Idaho Power operate, or adjacent areas, receive non-attainment designations.\nRegional Haze Rules: In accordance with federal regional haze rules under the CAA, coal-fired utility boilers are subject to regional haze - best available retrofit technology (RH BART) if they were built between 1962 and 1977 and affect any \"Class I\" (wilderness) areas. This includes all four units at the Jim Bridger and the Boardman coal-fired plants. The RH BART rules would have required installation of a suite of emissions controls at the Boardman plant; however, in December 2010, the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission approved a plan to install a less costly suite of environmental controls and cease coal-fired operations at the Boardman power plant no later than December 31, 2020.\nIn December 2009, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) issued a RH BART permit to PacifiCorp as the operator of the Jim Bridger plant. As part of the WDEQ's long term strategy for regional haze, the permit required that PacifiCorp install SCR equipment for NOx control at Jim Bridger units 3 and 4 by December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which has been completed, and submit an application by December 31, 2017 to install add-on NOx controls at Jim Bridger unit 2 by 2021 and unit 1 by 2022. In November 2010, PacifiCorp and the WDEQ signed a settlement agreement under\nwhich PacifiCorp agreed to the timing and nature of the controls. The settlement agreement was conditioned on the EPA ultimately approving those portions of the Wyoming regional haze SIP that are consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. In January 2014, the EPA approved Wyoming's regional haze SIP as to the Jim Bridger plant, with the NOx control compliance dates set forth in the settlement agreement. Several interested parties have appealed the EPA's decisions on Wyoming's regional haze SIP on various grounds. Idaho Power has not appealed the EPA's decisions but has intervened in the proceedings to participate if and to the extent the Jim Bridger plant could be affected.\nClean Water Act Matters\nDefinition of Waters of the United States\u201d Under the CWA: On August 28, 2015, the EPA's and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' final rule defining the phrase \"waters of the United States\" under the CWA became effective. Idaho Power believes that the final rule potentially expands federal jurisdiction under the CWA beyond traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, territorial seas, tributaries, and adjacent wetlands, to a number of other waters, including waters with a \"significant nexus\" to those traditional waters. As a result of the potential expansion, the final rule may result in additional permitting and regulatory requirements under multiple provisions of the CWA. Idaho Power has analyzed the final rule and expects that while it may incur additional permitting and other costs associated with the rule, the aggregate amount of increased costs is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition, in part due to the relatively arid climate of Idaho Power's service area and the existing application of the CWA to most of Idaho Power's facilities, including its hydroelectric plants.\nIn October 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay of the final waters of the United States rule from becoming effective. In response to the Sixth Circuit's decision, the EPA resumed nationwide use of the agency's prior regulations defining the term waters of the United States.\u201d The EPA stated that those regulations will be implemented as they were prior to August 27, 2015, by applying relevant case law, applicable policy, and the best science and technical data on a case-by-case basis in determining which waters are protected by the CWA.\nCWA Matters Related to Hydroelectric Relicensing: Idaho Power is also addressing CWA issues associated with the relicensing of its HCC. See Relicensing of Hydroelectric Projects\u201d in this MD&A for additional information on the impact of the CWA on that relicensing effort.\nReview of Federal Coal Leases\nIn January 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced that it would launch a comprehensive review to identify and evaluate potential reforms to the federal coal lease program. The review is intended to address questions such as how, when, and where to lease coal resources, how to account for the environmental and public health impacts of federal coal production, and how to ensure taxpayers are earning a fair return for the use of the coal resources. The U.S. Department of the Interior stated that it will not issue new coal leases during the pendency of the review, except under limited circumstances, but mining under existing leases will not be suspended during the review. BCC, which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant, currently leases its coal under federal, state, and private coal leases. It is uncertain how new federal lease applications will be handled during the U.S. Department of the Interior's coal lease review. Idaho Power believes that BCC has adequate reserves under existing leases to satisfy its coal delivery obligations to the Jim Bridger plant during the term of the existing coal supply contract through 2024, and that the Jim Bridger plant will otherwise have access to sufficient coal supplies for its operation for the foreseeable future. However, depending on the outcome of the Department of the Interior's review, the availability of coal resources could decline and the cost of leases for coal resources could increase, which could increase the fuel cost for each of Idaho Power's co-owned coal-fired plants.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWhen preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's management must apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates often involve judgment about factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management's control. Management adjusts these estimates based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual amounts could materially differ from the estimates. Management believes the accounting policies and estimates discussed below are the most critical to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.\nAccounting for Rate Regulation\nEntities that meet specific conditions are required by GAAP to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized. Similarly, certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities. Idaho Power must satisfy three conditions to apply regulatory accounting: (1) an independent regulator must set rates; (2) the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service; and (3) the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator.\nIdaho Power has determined that it meets these conditions, and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate-making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating Idaho Power. The primary effect of this policy is that Idaho Power had recorded $1.5 billion of regulatory assets and $447 million of regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2016. Idaho Power expects to recover these regulatory assets from customers through rates and refund these regulatory liabilities to customers through rates, but recovery or refund is subject to final review by the regulatory bodies. If future recovery or refund of these amounts ceases to be probable, or if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate those regulatory assets or liabilities. Either circumstance could have a material effect on Idaho Power's financial condition or results of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nIDACORP and Idaho Power use judgment and estimation in developing the provision for income taxes and the reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws can involve uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret such laws differently. Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts and may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income, cash flows, and tax-related assets and liabilities.\nIdaho Power provides deferred income taxes related to its plant assets for the difference between income tax depreciation and book depreciation used for financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes for other items are provided for the temporary differences between the income tax and financial accounting treatment of such items. Unless contrary to applicable income tax guidance, deferred income taxes are not provided for those income tax temporary differences where the prescribed regulatory accounting methods, or flow-through, direct Idaho Power to recognize the tax impacts currently for rate making and financial reporting.\nRefer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 2 - Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to income taxes.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nIdaho Power maintains a tax-qualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors called the Security Plan for Senior Management Employees (SMSP), and a postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits).\nThe costs IDACORP and Idaho Power record for these plans depend on the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, actual returns on plan assets, and several assumptions used in the actuarial valuations from which the expense is derived. The key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future stock market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors used to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates.\nThe assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high-quality corporate debt. Specifically, IDACORP and Idaho Power determined the discount rate for each plan through the construction of hypothetical portfolios of bonds selected from high-quality corporate bonds available as of December 31, 2016, with maturities matching the projected cash outflows of the plans. Based on the results of this analysis, the discount rate used to calculate the 2017 pension expense will be decreased to 4.45 percent from the 4.60 percent used in 2016.\nRate-of-return projections for plan assets are based on historical risk/return relationships among asset classes. The primary measure is the historical risk premium each asset class has delivered versus the yield on the Moody's AA Corporate Bond Index. This historical risk premium is then added to the current yield on the Moody's AA Corporate Bond Index, and Idaho\nPower believes the result provides a reasonable prediction of future investment performance. Additional analysis is performed to measure the expected range of returns, as well as worst-case and best-case scenarios. Based on the current interest rate environment, current rate-of-return expectations are lower than the nominal returns generated over the past 20 years when interest rates were generally much higher. The long-term rate of return used to calculate the 2017 pension expense will be 7.5 percent, the same assumption as was used for 2016.\nGross net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost for these plans totaled $52 million, $51 million, and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, including amounts deferred as regulatory assets (see discussion below) and amounts allocated to capitalized labor. For 2017, gross pension and other postretirement benefit costs are expected to total approximately $51 million, which takes into account the change in the discount rate noted above.\nHad different actuarial assumptions been used, pension expense could have varied significantly. The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in the discount rate and rate-of-return on plan assets actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension and postretirement expense:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate of return\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 0.5% rate increase on net periodic benefit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 0.5% rate decrease on net periodic benefit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, a 0.5 percent increase in the plans' discount rates would have resulted in a $74 million decrease in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of December 31, 2016. A 0.5 percent decrease in the plans' discount rates would have resulted in an $83 million increase in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of December 31, 2016.\nThe IPUC has authorized Idaho Power to account for its defined benefit pension plan expense on a cash basis, and to defer and account for accrued pension expense as a regulatory asset. The IPUC acknowledged that it is appropriate for Idaho Power to seek recovery in its revenue requirement of reasonable and prudently incurred pension expense based on actual cash contributions. In 2007, Idaho Power began deferring pension expense to a regulatory asset account to be matched with revenue when future pension contributions are recovered through rates. At December 31, 2016, a total of $105 million of expense was deferred as a regulatory asset. Approximately $23 million is expected to be deferred in 2017. Idaho Power recorded pension expense in 2016, 2015, and 2014 of $19 million, $19 million, and $35 million, respectively.\nRefer to Note 11 - Benefit Plans\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nContingent Liabilities\nAn estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if (a) it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no accrual is recorded but disclosure of the contingency, if material, in the notes to the financial statements is required. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized. IDACORP and Idaho Power have a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory and legal matters. If the recognition criteria have been met, liabilities have been recorded. Estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the financial statements.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a listing of new and recently adopted accounting standards, see Note 1 - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in this report, the general financial condition and results of operations for IDACORP and its subsidiaries and Idaho Power and its subsidiary are discussed. While reading the MD&A, please refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of IDACORP and Idaho Power. Also refer to \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and Part I - Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" in this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this MD&A and elsewhere in this report.\nINTRODUCTION\nIDACORP is a holding company formed in 1998 whose principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power. IDACORP's common stock is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol IDA\u201d. Idaho Power is an electric utility whose rates and other matters are regulated by the IPUC, OPUC, and FERC. Idaho Power generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to customers in its Idaho and Oregon service territories, as well as from the wholesale sale and transmission of electricity. Idaho Power experiences its highest retail energy sales during the summer irrigation and cooling season, with a lower peak in the winter that generally results from heating demand. Idaho Power's rates are established through regulatory proceedings that affect its ability to recover its costs and the potential to earn a return on its investment.\nIdaho Power is the parent of IERCo, a joint venturer in BCC, which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger generating plant owned in part by Idaho Power. IDACORP's other subsidiaries include IFS, an investor in affordable housing and other real estate investments; Ida-West Energy Company, an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the PURPA; and IDACORP Energy Services Co. (IESCo), which is the former limited partner of, and successor by merger to, IDACORP Energy L.P., a marketer of energy commodities that wound down operations in 2003.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nManagement's Outlook\nCustomer growth in Idaho Power's service area continues to benefit Idaho Power's revenues. To encourage continued responsible and sustainable growth, and as part of its planning for the future, Idaho Power actively participates in and supports state and local economic development initiatives. At the same time that Idaho Power pursues customer growth, it must also plan for that growth. Idaho Power plans for infrastructure that will support anticipated growth and allow it to continue to provide reliable, fair-priced electric power to its customers. To that end, Idaho Power's noteworthy capital projects include the replacement of aging assets, upgrades to generation plants, a multi-year plan for replacement of underground conductor, ongoing system upgrades, and continued permitting of the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West 500-kV transmission lines. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates total capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion over the next five years.\nIdaho Power operates within what it believes to be a constructive regulatory framework, achieved through general rate cases, subject-specific rate filings, tariff riders, and cost recovery mechanisms that share risks and benefits with Idaho Power's customers. To complement the regulatory framework, Idaho Power focuses on controlling power supply, operating, maintenance, and capital costs through process review and improvement initiatives, and by empowering employees to identify new means to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, and enhance individual and enterprise performance for the benefit of IDACORP's shareholders, Idaho Power's customers, and other stakeholders. Idaho Power's base rates were most recently reset in 2012 through general rate cases in Idaho and Oregon. During 2017, Idaho Power will continue to assess the need to file a general rate case to reset base rates in the coming years in Idaho or Oregon.\nSeparately, during 2016, IDACORP continued to make meaningful progress toward its target dividend payout ratio of between 50 and 60 percent of sustainable IDACORP earnings, which expanded on the progress made in previous years. From 2012 through 2016, IDACORP's board of directors approved a collective 83 percent increase in the quarterly dividend, from $0.30 to $0.55 per share.\n2016 Accomplishments and 2017 Initiatives\nIDACORP's business strategy emphasizes Idaho Power as IDACORP's core business. For the past several years, Idaho Power has been executing its three-part strategy of responsible planning, responsible development and protection of resources, and responsible energy use. This strategy is described in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business\" of this report. Examples of IDACORP's and Idaho Power's achievements and recognitions during 2016 under its three-part business strategy include:\n \u2022 IDACORP achieved net income growth for a ninth consecutive year; \n \u2022 IDACORP provided a 19 percent cumulative total shareholder return over the past three years, including share price appreciation and dividends paid, ranking in the 88th percentile among peers; \n \u2022 increased IDACORP's quarterly common stock dividend from $0.51 per share to $0.55 per share; \n \u2022 produced the best year of performance for Idaho Power's electric system reliability since formal measurement began in 2006; \n \u2022 executed on business optimization initiatives, focusing on improving operations and controlling expenditures; \n \u2022 made continued progress toward the permitting of the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West 500-kV transmission projects; \n \u2022 achieved Idaho Power's CO2 emissions intensity reduction goal; \n \u2022 earned the highest rolling 12-month customer relationship index score (Idaho Power's internal measure of customer satisfaction) ever recorded by the company; and \n \u2022 Idaho Power tied for 5th place in the annual \"Best Energy Companies\" rankings published by Public Utilities Fortnightly. \nFor 2017, IDACORP and Idaho Power have established a number of organizational initiatives, including the following:\n \u2022 continue to execute on the three core focuses for 2017-improving Idaho Power's core business, growing revenues, and enhancing the brand and positioning the company for the future; \n \u2022 continue to enhance and promote Idaho Power's safety culture; \n \u2022 grow financial strength by supporting business development in Idaho Power's service area while actively managing costs; \n \u2022 continue upward progress within IDACORP's target dividend payout ratio range; \n \u2022 pursue responsible investments that address customer growth while improving reliability, enhancing Idaho Power customers' experience, increasing shareholder value, and managing carbon impacts; and \n \u2022 integrate new renewable generation resources into Idaho Power's grid and continue progress toward participation in the Western EIM, anticipated to begin in the spring of 2018, which is expected to capture intra-hour market opportunities to help achieve greater reliability and improve system dispatch. \nOverview of General Factors and Trends Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition are affected by a number of factors, and the impact of those factors is discussed in more detail later in this MD&A. To provide context for the discussion elsewhere in this report, some of the more notable factors include the following:\n \u2022 Regulation of Rates and Cost Recovery: The price that Idaho Power is authorized to charge for its electric and transmission service is a critical factor in determining IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. Those rates are established by state regulatory commissions and the FERC, and are intended to allow Idaho Power an opportunity to recover its expenses and earn a reasonable return on investment. Because of the significant impact of ratemaking decisions, and in pursuit of its goal of advancing a purposeful regulatory strategy, Idaho Power focuses on timely recovery of its costs through filings with the company's regulators, working to put in place innovative regulatory mechanisms, and on the prudent management of expenses and investments. Idaho Power has a regulatory settlement stipulation in Idaho that includes provisions for the accelerated amortization of certain tax credits to help achieve a minimum 9.5 percent return on year-end equity in the Idaho jurisdiction (Idaho ROE). During 2017, Idaho Power will continue to assess the need to file a general rate case to reset base rates. \n \u2022 Economic Conditions and Loads: Economic conditions impact consumer demand for electricity and revenues, collectability of accounts, the volume of off-system sales, and the need to construct and improve infrastructure, purchase power, and implement programs to meet customer load demands. In recent years, Idaho Power has seen growth in the number of customers in its service area-in 2016, its customer count grew by 1.8 percent-and in employment in Idaho Power's service area, which grew by approximately 3.5 percent in 2016 based on Idaho Department of Labor preliminary December 2016 data. Idaho Power expects its number of customers to continue to \nincrease in the foreseeable future. Idaho Power has in recent years supported State of Idaho-coordinated efforts to promote economic development with an emphasis on attracting industrial and commercial customers to its service area.\nIn August 2016, Idaho Power began preparing its 2017 IRP, Idaho Power's long-term forecast of loads and resources. The load forecast assumptions Idaho Power expects to use in the 2017 IRP are included in the table below. For comparison purposes, the analogous average annual growth rates used in the prior two IRPs are included.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Forecast for 2016-2021 Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20-Year Forecast\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annual Growth Rate: Retail Sales\n(Billed MWh)\n</td> <td>Annual Growth Rate: Annual Peak\n(Peak Demand)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annual Growth Rate: Retail Sales\n(Billed MWh)\n</td> <td>Annual Growth Rate: Annual Peak\n(Peak Demand)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 IRP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3%\n</td> <td>1.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> <td>1.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 IRP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1%\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2%\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013 IRP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2%\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1%\n</td> <td>1.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Rate Base Growth and Infrastructure Investment: As noted above, the rates established by the IPUC and OPUC are determined so as to provide an opportunity for Idaho Power to recover authorized operating expenses and earn a reasonable return on rate base.\u201d Rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost (net of accumulated depreciation) of utility plant in service, subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items. Over time, rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write-offs as authorized by the IPUC and OPUC. In recent years, Idaho Power has been pursuing significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure, including major ongoing transmission projects such as the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West projects, in an effort to ensure an adequate supply of electricity, to provide service to new customers, and to maintain system reliability. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and component replacement, and the company is undertaking a significant relicensing effort for the Hells Canyon Complex (HCC), its largest hydroelectric generation resource. Idaho Power expects to include completed capital projects in its next general rate case or, in circumstances where appropriate, a single-issue rate case for individual projects with a significant capital cost. Depending on the outcome of the regulatory process and items such as the rate of return authorized by the IPUC and OPUC, this growth in rate base has the potential to increase Idaho Power's revenues and earnings. \n \u2022 Weather Conditions: Weather and agricultural growing conditions have a significant impact on Idaho Power's energy sales. Relatively low and high temperatures result in greater energy use for heating and cooling, respectively. During the agricultural growing season, which in large part occurs during the second and third quarters, irrigation customers use electricity to operate irrigation pumps, and weather conditions can impact the timing and extent of use of those pumps. Idaho Power also has tiered rates and seasonal rates, which contribute to increased revenues during higher-load periods, most notably during the third quarter of each year when overall customer demand is highest. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of weather on sales of energy to residential and small commercial customers is mitigated through the Idaho FCA mechanism. \nFurther, as Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities comprise nearly one-half of Idaho Power's nameplate generation capacity, precipitation levels impact the mix of Idaho Power's generation resources. When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must rely on more expensive generation sources and purchased power. When favorable hydroelectric generating conditions exist for Idaho Power, they also may exist for other Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facility operators, lowering regional wholesale market prices and impacting the revenue Idaho Power receives from off-system sales of its excess power. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of this volatility is addressed through the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms.\n \u2022 Mitigation of Impact of Fuel and Purchased Power Expense: In addition to hydroelectric generation, Idaho Power relies significantly on coal and natural gas to fuel its generation facilities and power purchases in the wholesale markets. Fuel costs are impacted by electricity sales volumes, the terms of contracts for fuel, Idaho Power's generation capacity, the availability of hydroelectric generation resources, transmission capacity, energy market prices, and Idaho Power's hedging program for managing fuel costs. Recently, low natural gas prices have made operation of Idaho Power's natural gas power plants more economical, resulting in increased operation of those plants and decreased operation of coal-fired plants. Purchased power costs are impacted by the terms of contracts for purchased power, the rate of expansion of alternative energy generation sources such as wind or solar energy, and wholesale energy market \nprices. The Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms mitigate in large part the potential adverse impacts of fluctuations in power supply costs to Idaho Power.\n \u2022 Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional elections: The recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation, and government policy. While it is uncertain whether and when any such changes will occur, they could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's businesses and the electric utility industry. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals discussed during and after the election that could have a material impact on IDACORP and Idaho Power include, but are not limited to, reform of the federal tax code; infrastructure renewal programs; and modifications to public company reporting requirements and environmental regulation. \n \u2022 Regulatory and Environmental Compliance Costs: Idaho Power is subject to extensive federal and state laws, policies, and regulations, as well as regulatory actions and audits by agencies and quasi-governmental agencies, including the FERC and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Compliance with these requirements directly influences Idaho Power's operating environment and affects Idaho Power's operating costs. Environmental laws and regulations, in particular, may increase the cost of operating generation plants and constructing new facilities, require that Idaho Power install additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants, or require that Idaho Power cease operating certain generation plants. For instance, the Boardman coal-fired power plant, in which Idaho Power owns a 10-percent interest, is scheduled to cease coal-fired operations by the end of 2020, a decision driven in large part by the substantial cost of environmental controls required by existing regulations. Similarly, Idaho Power is assessing the early closure of the North Valmy coal-fired power plant, of which Idaho Power owns a 50-percent interest, and in October and November 2016 filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC, respectively, requesting accelerated depreciation of the facility. Idaho Power expects to spend a considerable amount on environmental compliance and controls in the next decade. \n \u2022 Water Management and Relicensing of the Hells Canyon Hydroelectric Project: Because of Idaho Power's reliance on stream flow in the Snake River and its tributaries, Idaho Power participates in numerous proceedings and venues that may affect its water rights, seeking to preserve the long-term availability of its rights for its hydroelectric projects. Also, Idaho Power is involved in renewing its long-term federal license for the HCC, its largest hydroelectric generation source. Given the number of parties and issues involved, Idaho Power's relicensing costs have been and will continue to be substantial. Idaho Power cannot currently determine the terms of, and costs associated with, any resulting long-term license. \nSummary of 2016 Financial Results\nThe following is a summary of Idaho Power's net income, net income attributable to IDACORP, and IDACORP's earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands, except earnings per share amounts):\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Idaho Power net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to IDACORP, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average outstanding shares - diluted (000's)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IDACORP, Inc. earnings per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to IDACORP, Inc. for year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015 (items are in millions and are before tax unless otherwise noted):\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to IDACORP, Inc. - December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Idaho Power net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer growth, net of associated power supply costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Usage per customer, net of associated power supply costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating and maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other changes in operating revenues and expenses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Idaho Power operating income prior to sharing mechanisms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in operating income as a result of sharing mechanisms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Idaho Power operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total decrease in Idaho Power net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IESCo income from legal settlement (net of tax)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other changes (net of tax)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to IDACORP, Inc. - December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIDACORP's 2016 net income increased $3.6 million compared with 2015. While Idaho Power's 2016 net income was relatively flat, decreasing $1.7 million compared with 2015, net income from other subsidiaries increased IDACORP's net income by $5.3 million.\nContinued customer growth at Idaho Power increased operating income by $11.2 million, which was more than offset by a $14.7 million decrease from lower usage per customer in 2016 compared with 2015. Winter temperatures in 2016 were slightly colder than 2015, but milder summer temperatures in 2016 led to lower sales volumes, revenues, and operating income. Other operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses were $9.7 million higher in 2016 compared with 2015, largely related to higher variable labor-related costs.\nDuring 2015, Idaho Power recorded a total of $3.2 million as a provision against current revenue related to the October 2014 Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation that required sharing with Idaho customers of a portion of 2015 earnings that exceeded 10.0 percent. During 2016, no such sharing provision was recorded as Idaho Power's Idaho ROE did not exceed 10.0 percent. At December 31, 2016, the full $45 million of additional ADITC remains available for future use under the terms of the October 2014 Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation.\nIdaho Power's income tax expense was lower in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to greater net flow-through income tax benefits, additional share-based compensation tax benefits related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, and lower pretax income. These decreases were partially offset by a smaller flow-through benefit of a tax deductible make-whole premium that Idaho Power paid in connection with the early redemption of long-term debt in 2016 compared with the flow-through benefit of an early bond redemption in 2015.\nIDACORP's 2016 net income also included a $3.7 million increase, net of tax, in IESCo's earnings, a result of a December 2016 settlement relating to the California energy market proceedings. Refer to Note 10 - Contingencies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the settlement. IDACORP also benefited from distributions related to fully-amortized affordable housing investments at IFS, which reduced IDACORP's income tax expense.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section of the MD&A takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected IDACORP's and Idaho Power's earnings. In this analysis, the results for 2016 are compared with 2015 and the results for 2015 are compared with 2014.\nUtility Operations\nThe table below presents Idaho Power's energy sales and supply (in thousands of MWh) for the last three years.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General business sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-system sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total energy sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hydroelectric generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas and other generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total system generation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,130\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(935\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,037\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total energy supply\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales Volume and Generation: In 2016, general business sales volumes decreased less than 1 percent compared with the prior year. Winter temperatures in 2016 were slightly colder than 2015, but milder summer temperatures in 2016 led to lower sales volumes. Also, a shorter irrigation season due to a later start in 2016 compared with 2015 resulted in lower usage per irrigation customer than during 2015.\nOff-system sales volumes decreased 68 thousand MWh, or 5 percent, during 2016 compared with 2015. Low wholesale market prices reduced economic benefits of operating Idaho Power's non-hydroelectric generation facilities for off-system sales.\nFavorable hydroelectric generating conditions from greater snowpack in the spring of 2016 compared with the spring of 2015 led to increased hydroelectric generation in 2016. Coal-fired generation decreased in 2016 compared with 2015 as low wholesale market prices led to an increase in purchased power.\nThe financial impacts of fluctuations in off-system sales, purchased power, fuel expense, and other power supply-related expenses are addressed in Idaho Power's Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms, which are described later in this MD&A.\nGeneral Business Revenues: The table below presents Idaho Power's general business revenues (in thousands), MWh sales (in thousands), and number of customers for the last three years.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>514,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>512,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>306,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,156,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,164,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,140,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for sharing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,999\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue related to HCC relicensing AFUDC(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,706\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,706\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,706\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total general business revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,145,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,151,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,122,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume of Sales (MWh)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MWh sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of customers at year-end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>444,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>436,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>428,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Irrigation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>534,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>524,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Idaho Power is collecting approximately $10.7 million annually in the Idaho jurisdiction for AFUDC on HCC construction work in progress, but is deferring revenue recognition of the amounts collected until the license is issued and the accumulated license costs are placed in service.\nChanges in rates, changes in customer demand, and changes in FCA revenues are typically the primary causes of fluctuations in general business revenue from period to period. See \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for a list of rate changes implemented over the last three years. The primary influences on changes in customer demand for electricity are weather, economic conditions, and energy efficiency. Extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating, while moderate temperatures decrease sales. Precipitation levels and the timing of precipitation during the agricultural growing season also affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps. Boise, Idaho, weather-related information for the last three years is presented in the following table.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Normal(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Heating degree-days(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cooling degree-days(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Heating and cooling degree-days are common measures used in the utility industry to analyze the demand for electricity and indicate when a customer would use electricity for heating and air conditioning. A degree-day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from 65 degrees. Each degree of temperature above 65 degrees is counted as one cooling degree-day, and each degree of temperature below 65 degrees is counted as one heating degree-day. While Boise, Idaho weather conditions are not necessarily representative of weather conditions throughout Idaho Power's service area, the greater Boise area has the majority of Idaho Power's customers.\n(2) Normal heating degree-days and cooling degree-days elements are, by convention, the arithmetic mean of the elements computed over 30 consecutive years. The annual normal amounts are the sum of the 12 monthly normal amounts. These normal amounts are computed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nIdaho Power's rate structure provides for higher rates during the summer when system loads are at their highest, and includes tiers such that rates increase as a customer's consumption level increases. These seasonal and tiered rate structures contribute to seasonal fluctuations in revenues and earnings.\nGeneral Business Revenues - 2016 Compared with 2015: General business revenue decreased $5.0 million in 2016 compared with 2015. The factors affecting general business revenues included the following:\n \u2022 Rates: Rate changes decreased general business revenue by $3.9 million for 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the recovery of power cost adjustment amounts in 2016. The recovery of power cost adjustment amounts in rates has no effect on operating income as it is amortized into expense in the same period it is recovered through rates. \n \u2022 Customers: Customer growth of 1.8 percent increased general business revenue by $15.6 million in 2016 compared with 2015. \n \u2022 Usage: Lower usage (on a per customer basis), primarily by irrigation, commercial, and residential customers, decreased general business revenue by $21.3 million in 2016 compared with 2015. Winter temperatures in 2016 were slightly colder than 2015, but milder summer temperatures in 2016 compared with 2015 led to lower sales volumes. Also, a shorter irrigation season due to a later start in 2016 compared with 2015 resulted in lower usage per irrigation customer in 2016 than during 2015. Greater customer participation in energy efficiency programs also contributed to lower usage during 2016 compared with 2015. \n \u2022 Sharing: Idaho Power's sharing mechanism is associated with an Idaho regulatory settlement agreement that provides for the sharing with customers of a portion of Idaho-jurisdiction earnings exceeding a 10.0 percent Idaho ROE. The impact of this mechanism is partially recorded as a reduction to general business revenue. During 2015, Idaho Power recorded a total of $3.2 million as a provision against current revenue related to the sharing mechanism. In 2016, no such sharing provision was recorded as Idaho Power's Idaho ROE did not exceed 10.0 percent. \n \u2022 Idaho FCA Revenue: Partially offsetting lower usage per customer, the Idaho FCA mechanism increased revenues by $1.4 million in 2016 compared with 2015. Idaho Power accrued $30.3 million of Idaho FCA revenues in 2016, compared with $28.9 million in 2015. \nGeneral Business Revenues - 2015 Compared with 2014: General business revenue increased $28.8 million in 2015 compared with 2014. The factors affecting general business revenues included the following:\n \u2022 Rates: Two rate changes impacted general business revenue-an Idaho PCA rate increase effective June 1, 2014, and Idaho PCA rate decrease effective June 1, 2015, both described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Overall, rate changes combined to decrease general business revenue by $2.2 million in 2015. \n \u2022 Customers: Customer growth of 1.8 percent increased general business revenue by $14.1 million. \n \u2022 Usage: Lower usage per customer in 2015, primarily driven by the impact of more moderate winter weather on residential customer usage, as well as energy efficiency, decreased general business revenue by $0.7 million. Residential usage per customer was 1.4 percent lower in 2015. \n \u2022 Sharing: Revenue sharing of $3.2 million and $8.0 million were recorded in 2015 and 2014, respectively. This sharing resulted in a net increase to general business revenue of $4.8 million in 2015 compared with 2014. \n \u2022 Idaho FCA Revenue: FCA mechanism revenues increased $12.7 million compared with 2014, including the impacts of weather and of modifications made to the mechanism by the IPUC effective January 1, 2015. Idaho Power accrued $28.9 million of Idaho FCA revenues in 2015, compared with $16.2 million in 2014. The modifications to the FCA mechanism are described in more detail in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A and in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. \nOff-System Sales: Off-system sales consist primarily of opportunity sales of surplus system energy. The following table presents Idaho Power's off-system sales for the last three years (in thousands, except for MWh amounts):\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MWh sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per MWh\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-System Sales - 2016 Compared with 2015: Off-system sales revenue decreased by $5.7 million, or 18 percent. Off-system sales volumes decreased 5 percent in 2016 compared with the same periods in 2015 as low wholesale market prices reduced the economic benefits of operating Idaho Power's non-hydroelectric generation facilities for off-system sales. The average price of off-system sales for 2016 was 14 percent lower compared with 2015.\nOff-System Sales - 2015 Compared with 2014: Off-system sales revenue decreased by $46.3 million, or 60 percent, in 2015. Off-system sales volumes decreased 44 percent, as 2014 sales benefited from more favorable market conditions, at times, for selling power off-system. The average price of off-system sales transactions in 2015 was 29 percent lower than 2014, indicative of generally lower market prices in 2015. Decreases in output from hydroelectric resources and an increase in overall load due to customer growth also reduced the amount of surplus power available for sale off-system during 2015.\nOther Revenues: The table below presents the components of other revenues for the last three years (in thousands):\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transmission services and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy efficiency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Revenues - 2016 Compared with 2015: Other revenues increased $2.6 million, or 3 percent, in 2016 compared with 2015. Greater customer participation in energy efficiency programs increased revenue and corresponding expense in 2016 compared with 2015. Most energy efficiency activities are funded through a rider mechanism on customer bills. Energy efficiency program expenditures funded through the rider are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount of revenues recorded in other revenues, resulting in no net impact on earnings. The cumulative variance between expenditures and amounts collected through the rider is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability pending future collection from, or obligation to, customers. A liability balance indicates that Idaho Power has collected more than it has spent and an asset balance indicates that Idaho Power has spent more than it has collected. At December 31, 2016, Idaho Power's energy efficiency rider balances were a $5.6 million regulatory asset in the Oregon jurisdiction and a $10.7 million regulatory liability in the Idaho jurisdiction.\nOther Revenues - 2015 Compared with 2014: Other revenues increased $6.4 million, or 8 percent, in 2015. The increases in 2015 were primarily the result of increased electricity transmission (wheeling) volumes and greater customer participation in energy efficiency programs.\nPurchased Power: The table below presents Idaho Power's purchased power expenses and volumes for the last three years (in thousands, except for MWh amounts):\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PURPA contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchased power (including wheeling)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Demand response incentive payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total purchased power expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MWh purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PURPA contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MWh purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh from PURPA contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh from other purchased power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Weighted average - all sources (excluding demand response incentive payments)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIdaho Power is required by federal law to purchase power from some PURPA generation projects at a specified price regardless of the then-current load demand or wholesale energy market prices. The intermittent, non-dispatchable nature of the PURPA generation increases the likelihood that Idaho Power will at times be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources and may be required to sell its excess power in the wholesale power market at a significant loss. The other purchased power cost per MWh often exceeds the off-system sales revenue per MWh because Idaho Power generally needs to purchase more power during heavy load periods than during light load periods, and conversely has less energy available for off-system sales during heavy load periods than light load periods. Market energy prices are typically higher during heavy load periods than during light load periods. Also, in accordance with Idaho Power's risk management policy, Idaho Power may purchase or sell energy several months in advance of anticipated delivery. The regional energy market price is dynamic and additional energy purchase or sale transactions that Idaho Power makes at current market prices may be noticeably different than the advance purchase or sale transaction prices. Most of the non-PURPA purchased power and substantially all of the PURPA power purchase costs are recovered through base rates and Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nPurchased Power - 2016 Compared with 2015: Purchased power expense increased $19.3 million, or 9 percent, in 2016. The increase was due primarily to increased volumes purchased from both PURPA and non-PURPA sources attributable largely to lower market prices at times that encouraged market purchases rather than operating some generating units. Volume increases were partially offset by lower non-PURPA wholesale market prices.\nPurchased Power - 2015 Compared with 2014: Purchased power expense decreased $18.2 million, or 7 percent, in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to reduced volumes purchased from both PURPA and non-PURPA sources. Volume decreases were partially offset by increases in average prices of both PURPA and non-PURPA sources.\nFuel Expense: The table below presents Idaho Power's fuel expenses and thermal generation for the last three years (in thousands, except per MWh amounts):\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fuel expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>201,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MWh generated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coal (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total MWh generated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh - Coal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost per MWh - Natural gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average, all sources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) 2015 excludes 147 MWh of generation from the Jim Bridger power plant for which costs were capitalized during feasibility testing of capital projects under contemplation.\n(2)Includes a negligible amount of expense and generation related to the Salmon diesel-fired generation plant.\nThe majority of the fuel for Idaho Power's jointly-owned coal-fired plants is purchased through long-term contracts, including purchases from BCC, a one-third owned joint venture of IERCo. The price of coal from BCC is subject to fluctuations in mine operating expenses, geologic conditions, and production levels. BCC supplies up to two-thirds of the coal used by the Jim Bridger plant. Natural gas is mainly purchased on the regional wholesale spot market at published index prices. In addition to commodity (variable) costs, both natural gas and coal expense include costs that are more fixed in nature for items such as capacity charges, transportation, and fuel handling. Period to period variances in fuel expense per MWh are noticeably impacted by these fixed charges when generation output is substantially different between the periods.\nFuel Expense - 2016 Compared with 2015: In 2016, fuel expense decreased $6.7 million, or 4 percent, compared with 2015, due principally to decreased output from coal-fired plants and natural gas plants during 2016. Overall generation decreased 15 percent due to a change in resource mix resulting from increased purchase requirements from cogeneration and small power production (CSPP) projects, resource constraints at various generating locations, including Langley and Bridger, due to scheduled maintenance and other factors, and more open market purchases for economic reasons. The volume decreases were partially offset by higher coal prices due to higher mining costs at BCC. The higher mining costs resulted in part due to issues with underground mining equipment that is no longer in service.\nFuel Expense - 2015 Compared with 2014: In 2015, fuel expense decreased $15.0 million, or 7 percent, compared with 2014, due principally to decreased output from coal-fired plants during 2015 combined with lower regional natural gas prices for fuel used at the natural gas plants. Overall generation decreased 4 percent due to lower system loads and lower wholesale energy prices. The expense per MWh for natural gas decreased approximately 30 percent in 2015 compared with 2014. These lower natural gas prices led to a shift of generation from coal-fired plants to natural gas plants.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms: Idaho Power's power supply costs (primarily purchased power and fuel expense, less off-system sales) can vary significantly from year to year. Volatility of power supply costs arises from factors such as weather conditions, wholesale market prices, volumes of power purchased and sold in the wholesale markets, Idaho Power's hydroelectric and thermal generation volumes and fuel costs, generation plant availability, and retail loads. To address the volatility of power supply costs, Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in the Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions allow Idaho Power to recover from, or refund to, customers most of the fluctuations in power supply costs. In the Idaho jurisdiction, the PCA includes a cost or benefit sharing ratio that allocates the deviations in net power supply expenses between customers (95 percent) and Idaho Power (5 percent), with the exception of PURPA power purchases and demand response program incentives, which are allocated 100 percent to customers. The Idaho deferral period, or PCA year, runs from April 1 through March 31. Amounts deferred during the PCA year are primarily recovered or refunded during the subsequent June 1 through May 31 period. Because of the power cost adjustment mechanisms, the primary financial impacts of power supply cost variations is that cash is paid out but recovery from customers does not occur until a future period, or cash that is collected is refunded to customers in a future period, resulting in fluctuations in operating cash flows from year to year.\nThe table that follows presents the components of the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms for the last three years (in thousands).\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Idaho power supply cost deferrals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,841\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48,104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of prior year authorized balances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total power cost adjustment expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,330\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe power supply accruals (deferrals) represent the portion of the power supply cost fluctuations accrued (deferred) under the power cost adjustment mechanisms. When actual power supply costs are higher than the amount forecasted in power cost adjustment rates, which was the case for all periods presented, most of the difference is deferred. The amortization of the prior year's balances represents the offset to the amounts being collected or refunded in the current PCA year that were deferred or accrued in the prior PCA year (the true-up component of the PCA).\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2016 Compared with 2015: Actual net power supply cost deferrals increased in 2016 relative to 2015, a change of $8.0 million-from $35.8 million to $43.8 million. The increase in the deferral is due in part to higher fuel costs related to coal and purchased power with less surplus sales than forecasted. The $38.5 million of amortization offsets the collection from customers of prior years' deferrals and was lower in 2016 as Idaho Power is amortizing a smaller deferral balance in the current year than the prior year.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2015 Compared with 2014: Actual net power supply cost deferrals decreased in 2015 relative to 2014, a change of $12.3 million-from $48.1 million to $35.8 million. Power supply costs collected through base rates increased on June 1, 2015, resulting in less costs needing to be recovered through the power cost adjustment mechanisms since that time. The $52.6 million million of amortization offsets the collection from customers of prior years' deferrals.\nOther Operations and Maintenance Expenses: The changes in other O&M expenses for the periods presented are discussed below.\nO&M - 2016 Compared with 2015: Other O&M expense increased by $9.7 million in 2016 compared with 2015, an increase of 3 percent, due primarily to the following factors:\n \u2022 labor-related expenses increased $6.5 million, or 3 percent, in 2016 due to normal escalations in labor and benefits costs and higher variable employee costs; \n \u2022 scheduled maintenance at the Langley Gulch natural gas-fired generation plant increased O&M expenses $1.6 million; and \n \u2022 a $1.1 million increase primarily related to transmission agreements entered into in October 2015, which also resulted in a corresponding increase in other revenue. \nO&M - 2015 Compared with 2014: Other O&M expense decreased by $12.4 million in 2015 compared with 2014, a decrease of 3.5 percent, due to the following factors:\n \u2022 $16.7 million was recorded as additional pension expense in 2014 related to a December 2011 Idaho regulatory settlement agreement, which required sharing with Idaho customers of a portion of earnings in excess of a 10.0 percent Idaho ROE (thereby reducing customers' future pension obligations). There were no additional expenses related to the settlement agreement in 2015; \n \u2022 excluding the additional 2014 pension expense, labor-related expenses increased $2.1 million, or 1.1 percent, in 2015 due to normal escalations in labor and benefits costs; and \n \u2022 hydroelectric generation expenses increased $2.0 million, primarily due to increased repair costs and purchased services. \nIncome Taxes\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's 2016 income tax expense decreased $9.3 million and $11.0 million, respectively, when compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily due to greater net flow-through income tax benefits at Idaho Power, a tax benefit from the adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation, distributions related to fully-amortized affordable housing investments at IDACORP, and lower Idaho Power pre-tax earnings in 2016.\nIncome tax expense in 2015 increased significantly compared with 2014, principally as a result of a 2014 flow-through tax benefit related to the cumulative impact of tax accounting method changes for Idaho Power's capitalized repairs deduction that did not recur in 2015. For additional information relating to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes, including the availability of tax credit carryforwards, see Note 2 - Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nIdaho Power continues to pursue significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure in an effort to ensure an adequate supply of electricity, to provide service to new customers, and to maintain system reliability. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and component replacement. Idaho Power's expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, excluding AFUDC, were $287 million in 2016, $284 million in 2015, and $265 million in 2014. Idaho Power expects these substantial capital expenditures to continue, with estimated total capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion expected over the period from 2017 through 2021.\nIdaho Power funds its liquidity needs for capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. As of February 17, 2017, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's access to debt, equity, and credit arrangements included:\n \u2022 their respective $100 million and $300 million revolving credit facilities; \n \u2022 IDACORP's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of debt securities and common stock; \n \u2022 Idaho Power's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of first mortgage bonds and debt securities; $500 million is available for issuance pursuant to state regulatory authority; and \n \u2022 IDACORP's and Idaho Power's issuance of commercial paper, which may be issued up to an amount equal to the available credit capacity under their respective credit facilities. \nBased on planned capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses for 2017, the companies believe they will be able to meet capital requirements and fund corporate expenses during 2017 with a combination of existing cash and operating cash flows generated by Idaho Power's utility business, together with proceeds from either draws on credit facilities or Idaho Power's issuance of debt securities. IDACORP and Idaho Power believe they could meet any short-term cash shortfall with existing credit facilities and expect to continue to manage short-term liquidity through commercial paper markets.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power monitor capital markets with a view toward opportunistic debt and equity transactions, taking into account current and potential future long-term needs. As a result, IDACORP may issue debt securities or common stock, and Idaho Power may issue debt securities, if the companies believe terms available in the capital markets are favorable and that issuances would be financially prudent. Idaho Power also periodically analyzes whether partial or full early redemption of one or more existing outstanding series of first mortgage bonds is desirable, and in some cases may refinance indebtedness with new indebtedness issued with more favorable terms. To that end, on March 10, 2016, Idaho Power issued $120 million in principal amount of 4.05% first mortgage bonds, Series J, maturing on March 1, 2046. On April 11, 2016, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to maturity, its $100 million in principal amount of 6.15% first mortgage bonds, Series H, due April 2019. In accordance with the redemption provisions of the original terms of the notes, the redemption included payment by Idaho Power of a make-whole premium of $14 million. The make-whole premium resulted in a current income tax deduction, which under Idaho Power's regulatory flow-through tax accounting produced an income tax benefit of approximately $5.6 million recorded in the second quarter of 2016. Idaho Power also expects to receive an incremental net benefit to net income as a result of the lower interest rate of the notes issued in March 2016 compared with the interest rate associated with the redeemed notes. Idaho Power used a portion of the net proceeds of the March 2016 sale of first mortgage bonds, medium-term notes to effect the redemption. The companies do not expect to redeem any existing outstanding debt during 2017.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power seek to maintain capital structures of approximately 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, and maintaining this ratio influences IDACORP's and Idaho Power's debt and equity issuance decisions. As of December 31, 2016, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's capital structures, as calculated for purposes of applicable debt covenants, were as follows:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIDACORP and Idaho Power generally maintain their cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, money market funds, and bank deposits.\nOperating Cash Flows\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's principal sources of cash flows from operations are Idaho Power's sales of electricity and transmission capacity. Significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of fuel and power, other operating expenses, interest, income taxes, and pension plan contributions. Operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather conditions, rates and the outcome of regulatory proceedings, and economic conditions. As fuel and purchased power are significant uses of cash, Idaho Power has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of the fluctuation in those costs. However, if actual costs rise above the level allowed in retail rates, deferral balances increase (reflected as a regulatory asset), negatively affecting operating cash flows until such time as those costs, with interest, are recovered from customers.\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating cash inflows in 2016 were $348 million and $311 million, respectively, a decrease of $5 million for IDACORP and $35 million decrease for Idaho Power when compared with 2015. Significant items that affected the companies' operating cash flows in 2016 relative to 2015 were as follows:\n \u2022 changes in regulatory assets and liabilities, mostly related to the relative amounts of power supply and fixed costs deferred and collected under the Idaho rate mechanisms, decreased operating cash inflows by $19 million; \n \u2022 changes in deferred taxes and in taxes accrued and receivable combined to decrease cash flows by $3 million and $34 million at IDACORP and Idaho Power, respectively; \n \u2022 Idaho Power received $24 million of distributions from IERCo's investment in BCC for 2016, compared with $11 million in 2015. Changes in distributions from year to year are primarily driven by changes in the timing of cash needs associated with BCC; and \n \u2022 comparative changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities increased cash flows by $7 million in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily related to changes in accounts payable due to timing of payments. \nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating cash inflows in 2015 were $353 million and $346 million, respectively, a decrease of $11 million for IDACORP and a slight increase for Idaho Power when compared with 2014. Significant items that affected the companies' operating cash flows in 2015 relative to 2014 were as follows:\n \u2022 changes in regulatory assets and liabilities, mostly related to the relative amounts of power supply and fixed costs deferred and collected under the Idaho rate mechanisms, decreased operating cash inflows by $18 million; \n \u2022 Idaho Power made $39 million of cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan in 2015, compared with $30 million of cash contributions during 2014; \n \u2022 changes in deferred taxes and in taxes accrued and receivable combined to increase cash flows by $34 million and $50 million at IDACORP and Idaho Power, respectively; and \n \u2022 comparative changes in working capital balances due primarily to timing-principally related to a smaller decrease in accounts receivable in 2015 compared to the decrease in accounts receivable in 2014. Changes in accounts receivable balances reduced operating cash flows $16 million and $18 million for IDACORP and Idaho Power, respectively. \nInvesting Cash Flows\nInvesting activities consist primarily of capital expenditures related to new construction and improvements to Idaho Power's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. Idaho Power's construction expenditures, including the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction, were $297 million, $294 million, and $274 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. These capital expenditures were primarily for construction of utility infrastructure needed to address Idaho Power's aging plant and equipment, customer growth, and environmental and regulatory compliance requirements. As discussed in \"Capital Requirements\" below, Idaho Power received $8 million and $11 million in 2016 and 2015 from Boardman-to-Hemingway project joint permitting participants relating to a portion of these construction expenditures.\nIdaho Power has a Rabbi trust designated to provide funding for obligations of its nonqualified defined benefit plans. In the Rabbi trust, Idaho Power purchased $15 million, $14 million, and $8 million of available-for-sale securities in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In 2016 and 2015, Idaho Power received $16 million and $34 million, respectively, of proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities and used $10 million and $30 million of the proceeds, respectively, to acquire company-owned life insurance.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nFinancing activities provide supplemental cash for both day-to-day operations and capital requirements as needed. Idaho Power funds liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital, managing commodity price risk, and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. IDACORP funds its cash requirements, such as payment of taxes, capital contributions to Idaho Power, and non-utility operating expenses through cash flows from operations, commercial paper markets, sales of common stock, and credit facilities. The following are significant items and transactions that affected financing cash flows in 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n \u2022 on March 10, 2016, Idaho Power issued $120 million in principal amount of 4.05% first mortgage bonds Series J, maturing March 1, 2046; \n \u2022 on April 11, 2016, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to maturity, $100 million of its 6.15% first mortgage bonds, Series H, due April 1, 2019, and paid a related make-whole premium of $14 million; \n \u2022 on March 6, 2015, Idaho Power issued $250 million in principal amount of 3.65% first mortgage bonds, Series J, maturing on March 1, 2045; \n \u2022 on April 23, 2015, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to maturity, $120 million in principal amount of 6.025% first mortgage bonds, medium-term notes due July 2018, and paid a related make-whole premium of $18 million; \n \u2022 IDACORP and Idaho Power paid dividends of approximately $105 million, $97 million, and $88 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively; \n \u2022 IDACORP's net change in commercial paper borrowings provided cash of $2 million in 2016 and used cash of $11 million and $23 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively; and \n \u2022 Idaho Power borrowed $22 million in commercial paper in December 2016. \nFinancing Programs and Available Liquidity\nIDACORP Equity Programs: In recent years IDACORP has entered into sales agency agreements under which IDACORP could offer and sell shares of its common stock from time to time through BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC as IDACORP's agent. The most recent agency agreement terminated in May 2016, but IDACORP may choose to enter into a new sales agency agreement in the future. On May 20, 2016, IDACORP filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which became effective upon filing, for the potential offer and sale of an unspecified amount of shares of common stock. As of the date of this report, IDACORP is assessing whether to execute a new sales agency agreement for the issuance and sale of common stock, as the company does not anticipate issuing any shares of its common stock outside of its equity or deferral compensation programs in 2017.\nSince 2012, IDACORP has not used original issue shares of common stock for the IDACORP, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan or the Idaho Power Company Employee Savings Plan, but instead plan administrators have used market purchases of IDACORP common stock. However, IDACORP may determine at any time to use original issuances of common stock under those plans. As noted above, an important component of that determination will be IDACORP's and Idaho Power's capital structure.\nIdaho Power First Mortgage Bonds: Idaho Power's issuance of long-term indebtedness is subject to the approval of the IPUC, OPUC, and Wyoming Public Service Commission (WPSC). In April and May 2016, Idaho Power received orders from the IPUC, OPUC, and WPSC authorizing Idaho Power to issue and sell from time to time up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities and first mortgage bonds, subject to conditions specified in the orders. Authority from the IPUC is effective through May 31, 2019, subject to extension upon request to the IPUC. The OPUC's and WPSC's orders do not impose a time limitation for issuances, but the OPUC order does impose a number of other conditions, including a requirement that the interest rates for the debt securities or first mortgage bonds fall within either (a) designated spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury rates or (b) a maximum interest rate limit of seven percent.\nOn September 27, 2016, Idaho Power entered into a selling agency agreement with seven banks named in the agreement in connection with the potential issuance and sale from time to time of up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds, secured medium term notes, Series K (Series K Notes), under Idaho Power's Indenture of Mortgage and Deed\nof Trust, dated as of October 1, 1937, as amended and supplemented (Indenture). At the same time, Idaho Power entered into the Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 1, 2016, to the Indenture (Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture). The Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture provides for, among other items, (a) the issuance of up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of Series K Notes pursuant to the Indenture and (b) the increase of the maximum amount of obligations to be secured by the Indenture to $2.5 billion (which maximum amount may be further increased or decreased by Idaho Power without the consent of the holders of first mortgage bonds). As of the date of this report, Idaho Power had not sold any first mortgage bonds, including Series K Notes, or debt securities under the selling agency agreement.\nThe issuance of first mortgage bonds requires that Idaho Power meet interest coverage and security provisions set forth in the Indenture. Future issuances of first mortgage bonds are subject to satisfaction of covenants and security provisions set forth in the Indenture, market conditions, regulatory authorizations, and covenants contained in other financing agreements.\nThe Indenture limits the amount of first mortgage bonds at any one time outstanding to $2.5 billion, and as a result the maximum amount of first mortgage bonds Idaho Power could issue as of December 31, 2016, was limited to approximately $759 million. Idaho Power may increase the $2.5 billion limit on the maximum amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding by filing a supplemental indenture with the trustee as provided in the Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust. Separately, the Indenture also limits the amount of additional first mortgage bonds that Idaho Power may issue to the sum of (a) the principal amount of retired first mortgage bonds and (b) 60 percent of total unfunded property additions, as defined in the Indenture. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power could issue approximately $1.7 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on retired first mortgage bonds and total unfunded property additions.\nRefer to Note 4 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information regarding long-term financing arrangements.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power Credit Facilities: In November 2015, IDACORP and Idaho Power entered into credit agreements for $100 million and $300 million credit facilities, respectively. These facilities replaced IDACORP's and Idaho Power's existing Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreements, dated October 26, 2011, as amended. Each of the credit facilities may be used for general corporate purposes and commercial paper back-up. IDACORP's facility permits borrowings under a revolving line of credit of up to $100 million at any one time outstanding, including swingline loans not to exceed $10 million at any time and letters of credit not to exceed $50 million at any time. IDACORP's facility may be increased, subject to specified conditions, to $150 million. Idaho Power's facility permits borrowings through the issuance of loans and standby letters of credit of up to $300 million at any one time outstanding, including swingline loans not to exceed $30 million at any one time and letters of credit not to exceed $100 million at any time. Idaho Power's facility may be increased, subject to specified conditions, to $450 million. The interest rates for any borrowings under the facilities are based on either (1) a floating rate that is equal to the highest of the prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.5 percent, or LIBOR rate plus 1.0 percent, or (2) the LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, provided that the federal funds rate and LIBOR rate will not be less than zero percent. The applicable margin is based on IDACORP's or Idaho Power's, as applicable, senior unsecured long-term indebtedness credit rating, as set forth on a schedule to the credit agreements. The companies also pay a facility fee based on the respective company's credit rating for senior unsecured long-term debt securities.\nEach facility contains a covenant requiring each company to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization equal to or less than 65 percent as of the end of each fiscal quarter. In determining the leverage ratio, consolidated indebtedness\u201d broadly includes all indebtedness of the respective borrower and its subsidiaries, including, in some instances, indebtedness evidenced by certain hybrid securities (as defined in the credit agreement). Consolidated total capitalization\u201d is calculated as the sum of all consolidated indebtedness, consolidated stockholders' equity of the borrower and its subsidiaries, and the aggregate value of outstanding hybrid securities. At December 31, 2016, the leverage ratios for IDACORP and Idaho Power were 45 percent and 47 percent, respectively. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to utilize the credit facilities is conditioned upon their continued compliance with the leverage ratio covenants included in the credit facilities. There are additional covenants, subject to exceptions, that prohibit certain mergers, acquisitions, and investments, restrict the creation of certain liens, and prohibit entering into any agreements restricting dividend payments from any material subsidiary. At December 31, 2016, IDACORP and Idaho Power believe they were in compliance with all facility covenants. Further, IDACORP and Idaho Power do not believe they will be in violation or breach of their respective debt covenants during 2017.\nThe events of default under both facilities include, without limitation, non-payment of principal, interest, or fees; materially false representations or warranties; breach of covenants; bankruptcy or insolvency events; condemnation of property; cross-default to certain other indebtedness; failure to pay certain judgments; change of control; failure of IDACORP to own free and\nclear of liens the voting stock of Idaho Power; the occurrence of specified events or the incurring of specified liabilities relating to benefit plans; and the incurring of certain environmental liabilities, subject, in certain instances, to cure periods.\nUpon any event of default relating to the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of IDACORP or Idaho Power or the appointment of a receiver, the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the applicable facility and to issue letters of credit will automatically terminate and all unpaid obligations will become due and payable. Upon any other event of default, the lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the outstanding loans or greater than 50 percent of the aggregate commitments (required lenders) or the administrative agent with the consent of the required lenders may terminate or suspend the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and to issue letters of credit under the facility and/or declare the obligations to be due and payable. During an event of default under the facilities, the lenders may, at their option, increase the applicable interest rates then in effect and the letter of credit fee by 2.0 percentage points per annum. A ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the cost of borrowing, but would not result in a default or acceleration of the debt under the facilities. However, if Idaho Power's ratings are downgraded below investment grade, Idaho Power must extend or renew its authority for borrowings under its IPUC and OPUC regulatory orders.\nWhile the credit facilities provide for an original maturity date of November 6, 2020, the credit agreements grant IDACORP and Idaho Power the right to request up to two one-year extensions, in each case subject to certain conditions. On November 7, 2016, IDACORP and Idaho Power executed the first extension agreement with the consent of all the lenders, extending the maturity date under both credit agreements to November 5, 2021. No other terms of the credit facilities, including the amount of permitted borrowing under the credit agreements, were affected by the extensions.\nWithout additional approval from the IPUC, the OPUC, and the WPSC, the aggregate amount of short-term borrowings by Idaho Power at any one time outstanding may not exceed $450 million. Idaho Power has obtained approval of the state public utility commissions of Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming for the issuance of short-term borrowings through November 2022.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power Commercial Paper: IDACORP and Idaho Power have commercial paper programs under which they issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the available capacity under their respective credit facilities, described above. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities are available to the companies to support borrowings under their commercial paper programs. The commercial paper issuances are used to provide an additional financing source for the companies' short-term liquidity needs. The maturities of the commercial paper issuances will vary, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. Individual instruments carry a fixed rate during their respective terms, although the interest rates are reflective of current market conditions, subjecting the companies to fluctuations in interest rates.\nAvailable Short-Term Borrowing Liquidity\nThe following table outlines available short-term borrowing liquidity as of the dates specified: Table 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,800\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Identified for other use(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net balance available\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Port of Morrow and American Falls bonds that Idaho Power could be required to purchase prior to maturity under the optional or mandatory purchase provisions of the bonds, if the remarketing agent for the bonds were unable to sell the bonds to third parties.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Holding company only.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below presents additional information about short-term commercial paper borrowing during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Table 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year end:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Daily average amount outstanding during the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate during the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum month-end balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Holding company only.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt February 17, 2017, IDACORP had no loans outstanding under its credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding, and Idaho Power had no loans outstanding under its credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding.\nImpact of Credit Ratings on Liquidity and Collateral Obligations\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, depends in part on their respective credit ratings. The following table outlines the ratings of Idaho Power's and IDACORP's securities, and the ratings outlook, by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services as of the date of this report:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IDACORP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho Power\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Issuer Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Mortgage Bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>None\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Secured Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>None\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's Rating Services:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Credit Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-Term Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese security ratings reflect the views of the ratings agencies. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings and, accordingly, each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nIdaho Power maintains margin agreements relating to its wholesale commodity contracts that allow performance assurance collateral to be requested of and/or posted with certain counterparties. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power had posted no performance assurance collateral. Should Idaho Power experience a reduction in its credit rating on its unsecured debt to below investment grade, Idaho Power could be subject to requests by its wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral, and counterparties to derivative instruments and other forward contracts could request immediate payment or demand immediate ongoing full daily collateralization on derivative instruments and contracts in net liability positions. Based upon Idaho Power's current energy and fuel portfolio and market conditions as of December 31, 2016, the amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a downgrade to below investment grade is approximately $11.6 million. To minimize capital requirements, Idaho Power actively monitors its portfolio exposure and the potential exposure to additional requests for performance assurance collateral through sensitivity analysis.\nCapital Requirements\nIdaho Power's construction expenditures, excluding AFUDC, were $287 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The table below presents Idaho Power's estimated cash requirements for construction, excluding AFUDC, for 2017 through 2021 (in millions of dollars). However, given the uncertainty associated with the timing of infrastructure projects and associated expenditures, actual expenditures and their timing could deviate substantially from those set forth in the table.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected capital expenditures (excluding AFUDC)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290-300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285-295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>900-950\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInfrastructure Projects: A significant portion of expected capital expenditures included in the five-year forecast above relate to a large number of small projects as Idaho Power continues to add to its system to accommodate growth and improve reliability and operational effectiveness. These projects involve significant capital expenditures. Examples of anticipated system enhancements planned for 2017 through 2021 and estimated costs include the following:\n \u2022 $35-$65 million per year for transmission system projects other than the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West projects; \n \u2022 $75-$95 million per year for construction and replacement of distribution lines and stations, including replacement of underground distribution cables; \n \u2022 $25-$45 million per year for ongoing improvements and replacements at coal- and natural gas-fired plants; \n \u2022 $45-$65 million per year for hydroelectric plant improvement programs, including relicensing and mitigation costs; and \n \u2022 $45-$65 million per year for general plant improvements, such as land and buildings, vehicles, information technology, and communication equipment. \nOther Major Infrastructure Projects: Idaho Power has recently completed or is engaged in the development of a number of significant projects and has entered into arrangements with third parties for joint development of infrastructure projects. The most notable projects are described below.\nJim Bridger Plant Selective Catalytic Reduction Equipment: Idaho Power and the plant co-owners recently completed installation of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions at the Jim Bridger power plant, in order to comply with regional haze rules. The regional haze rules provided for installation of SCR on unit 3 and unit 4. The rules provide for an equivalent technology for NOx reductions on unit 2 by 2021 and unit 1 by 2022. Idaho Power has expended $100 million, excluding AFUDC, on SCR installation at units 3 and 4 through December 31, 2016. The unit 3 SCR was operating as of November 2015, and the unit 4 SCR was operating as of November 2016. In light of the uncertainty resulting from pending environmental regulation and the substantial estimated cost of the SCR installation, as of the date of this report, Idaho Power is assessing whether to move forward with the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger power plant. The expected capital expenditures in the table above do not include any estimated expenditures relating to the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2.\nBoardman-to-Hemingway Transmission Line: The Boardman-to-Hemingway line, a proposed 300-mile, 500-kV transmission project between a station near Boardman, Oregon, and the Hemingway station near Boise, Idaho, would provide transmission service to meet future resource needs. The Boardman-to-Hemingway line was included in the preferred resource portfolio in Idaho Power's 2015 IRP. In January 2012, Idaho Power entered into a joint funding agreement with PacifiCorp and the Bonneville Power Administration to pursue permitting of the project. The joint funding agreement provides that Idaho Power's interest in the permitting phase of the project would be approximately 21 percent, and that during future negotiations relating to construction of the transmission line Idaho Power would seek to retain that percentage interest in the completed project. Assuming both other participants fund their full share of the total cost of the permitting phase of the project, Idaho Power's estimated share of the cost of the permitting phase of the project is approximately $44 million, including Idaho Power's AFUDC. Total cost estimates for the project are between $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, including AFUDC. This cost estimate excludes the impacts of inflation and price changes of materials and labor resources that may occur following the date of the estimate. Idaho Power's share of the permitting phase of the project (excluding AFUDC) is included in the capital requirements table above in addition to approximately $45 million of Idaho Power's share of costs related to early construction efforts primarily included in the periods 2019-2021. These preliminary estimates of Idaho Power's share of early construction costs could significantly change as the construction timeline nears and as the project participants further align on future activities and estimates.\nApproximately $87 million has been expended on the Boardman-to-Hemingway project through December 31, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the joint funding arrangements, Idaho Power has received approximately $42 million of that amount as reimbursement from the project participants as of December 31, 2016. Idaho Power has accrued in receivables approximately $16 million more that will be billed by Idaho Power in the future to the project participants for expenses Idaho Power has incurred, for a total amount reimbursable by joint permitting participants of $58 million. In addition to the $58 million amount, $6 million is subject to reimbursement at a later date from the joint permitting participants, assuming their continued participation in the project, for expenses Idaho Power incurred prior to execution of the joint funding arrangements. Joint permitting participants are obligated to reimburse Idaho Power for their share of any future project permitting expenditures incurred by Idaho Power. Idaho Power plans to seek recovery of its share of project costs through the regulatory process.\nThe permitting phase of the Boardman-to-Hemingway project is subject to federal review and approval by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the U.S. Forest Service, the Department of the Navy, the Army Corps of Engineers, and certain other federal agencies. The BLM, as the lead federal agency on the National Environmental Policy Act review, issued a final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the project on November 25, 2016. As of the date of this report, the BLM's schedule provides for the issuance of a record of decision in 2017. In the separate Oregon state permitting process, Idaho Power expects its amended preliminary application for site certificate to be deemed complete by the Oregon Department of Energy in 2017. Idaho Power is unable to determine an in-service date for the line but, given the status of ongoing permitting activities, expects the in-service date would be in 2023 or beyond.\nGateway West Transmission Line: Idaho Power and PacifiCorp are pursuing the joint development of the Gateway West project, a 500-kV transmission project between a station located near Douglas, Wyoming and the Hemingway station. In January 2012, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp entered a joint funding agreement for permitting of the project. Idaho Power's estimated cost for the permitting phase of the Gateway West project is approximately $60 million, including AFUDC. Idaho Power has expended approximately $32 million on the permitting phase of the project through December 31, 2016. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates the total cost for its share of the project (including both permitting and construction) to be between $200 million and $400 million, including AFUDC. Idaho Power's share of the permitting phase of the project (excluding AFUDC) is included in the capital requirements table above in addition to approximately $35 million of Idaho Power's share of costs related to early construction efforts primarily in the periods 2019-2021. These preliminary estimates of Idaho Power's share of early construction costs could significantly change as the construction timeline nears and as the project participants further align on future activities and estimates.\nThe permitting phase of the Gateway West project is subject to review and approval of the BLM. The BLM released its record of decision in November 2013 for eight of the ten transmission line segments. On January 20, 2017, the BLM released its record of decision for the remaining two transmission line segments. In September 2016, the U.S. Department of Interior Board of Land Appeals affirmed the BLM's November 2013 record of decision, which was challenged by certain third-parties. In February 2017, the State of Idaho and others filed with the U.S. Department of Interior Board of Land Appeals notices of appeal and requests for a stay of the BLM's record of decision.\nHells Canyon Complex Relicensing: The HCC, located on the Snake River where it forms the border between Idaho and Oregon, provides approximately 68 percent of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating nameplate capacity and 32 percent of its total generating nameplate capacity. Idaho Power has been engaged in the process of obtaining from the FERC a new long-term license for the HCC. The past and anticipated future costs associated with obtaining a new long-term license for the HCC are significant. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates that the annual costs it will incur to obtain a new long-term license for the HCC, including AFUDC but excluding costs expected to be incurred for complying with the license after issuance, are likely to range from $25 million to $35 million until issuance of the license, which Idaho Power estimates will occur no earlier than 2021. Idaho Power expects that the annual capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses associated with compliance with the terms and conditions of the long-term license could also be substantial, but the company is currently unable to estimate those costs in light of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate terms and conditions that may be included in the license. Idaho Power intends to seek recovery of those relicensing and compliance costs in rates through the regulatory process. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for additional details relating to the relicensing process.\nEnvironmental Regulation Costs: Idaho Power anticipates that it will incur significant expenditures for the installation of environmental controls at its coal-fired plants and for its hydroelectric relicensing efforts. The near-term cost estimates for environmental matters are summarized in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business\" of this report. The capital portion of these amounts is included in the Capital Requirements table above but does not include costs related to possible changes in current or new environmental laws or regulations and enforcement policies that may be enacted in response to issues such as climate change and emissions from coal-fired and gas-fired generation plants.\nLong-Term Resource Planning: The IPUC and OPUC require that Idaho Power prepare biennially an IRP. Idaho Power filed its most recent IRP in June 2015 and expects to file its 2017 IRP in June 2017. The IRP seeks to forecast Idaho Power's loads and resources for a 20-year period, analyzes potential supply-side and demand-side resource options, and identifies potential near-term and long-term actions. The 2015 IRP included as near-term action items the continued permitting and planning for the Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission line and further investigation of the early retirement of the North Valmy power plant in collaboration with the plant's co-owner. Idaho Power filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC in October and November 2016, respectively, requesting accelerated depreciation of the North Valmy plant in connection with the potential early closure of the plant, which remain pending. The near-term action plan also included commencement of an economic evaluation of environmental control retrofits for units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger power plant. Additional information on Idaho Power's 2015 IRP and 2017 IRP is included in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business - Resource Planning\" in this report.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Contributions and Recovery\nIdaho Power contributed $40 million, $39 million, and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plan in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Idaho Power estimates that it has no minimum contribution requirement for 2017, though it plans to contribute between $20 million and $40 million to the pension plan during 2017. Idaho Power's contributions are made in a continued effort to balance the regulatory collection of these expenditures with the amount and timing of contributions to mitigate the cost of being in an underfunded position. In 2017 and beyond, Idaho Power expects continuing significant contribution obligations under the pension plan. Refer to Note 11 - \"Benefit Plans\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and the section titled \"Contractual Obligations\" below in this MD&A for information relating to those obligations.\nIdaho Power defers its Idaho-jurisdiction pension expense as a regulatory asset until recovered from Idaho customers. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power's deferral balance associated with the Idaho jurisdiction was $105 million. Deferred pension costs are expected to be amortized to expense to match the revenues received when contributions are recovered through rates. Idaho Power only records a carrying charge on the unrecovered balance of cash contributions. The IPUC has authorized Idaho Power to recover and amortize $17 million of deferred pension costs annually, and has applied $68 million against the deferred amount under its Idaho sharing mechanisms since 2011. The primary impact of pension contributions is on the timing of cash flows, as cost recovery lags behind the timing of contributions.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents IDACORP's and Idaho Power's contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2016, for the respective periods in which they are due:\n Payments Due by Period Total 2017 2018-2019 2020-2021 Thereafter (millions of dollars) Long-term debt(1) $ 1,766 $ 1 $ - $ 230 $ 1,535 Future interest payments(2) 1,464 82 163 151 1,068 Operating leases(3) 48 3 8 8 29 Purchase obligations: Cogeneration and small power production(4) 4,309 229 465 465 3,150 Fuel supply agreements 206 57 31 17 101 Other(4) 181 39 40 22 80 Pension and postretirement benefit plans(5) 246 8 78 115 45 Other long-term liabilities 1 1 - - - Total $ 8,221 $ 420 $ 785 $ 1,008 $ 6,008 (1) For additional information, see Note 4 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. (2) Future interest payments are calculated based on the assumption that all debt is outstanding until maturity. For debt instruments with variable rates, interest is calculated for all future periods using the rates in effect at December 31, 2016. (3) The operating leases include right-of-way easements. Approximately $13 million of the obligations included have contracts that do not specify terms related to expiration. As these contracts are presumed to continue indefinitely, ten years of information, estimated based on current contract terms, has been included in the table for presentation purposes. (4) Approximately $6 million of the amounts in cogeneration and small power production and $23 million of the amounts in other purchase obligations are contracts that do not specify terms related to expiration. As these contracts are presumed to continue indefinitely, ten years of information, estimated based on current contract terms, has been included in the table for presentation purposes. Other purchase obligations also includes Idaho Power's estimated proportionate funding obligation for goods and services under non-fuel purchase agreements at its jointly-owned generation facilities. In some instances, Idaho Power is not a direct party to an underlying purchase agreement, but is obligated under the instruments governing the joint ventures to reimburse the co-owner for payments the co-owner makes pursuant to the purchase agreement. Those estimated amounts have been included in the table above. (5) Idaho Power estimates pension contributions based on actuarial data. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power cannot estimate pension contributions beyond 2021 with any level of precision, and amounts through 2021 are estimates only and are subject to change. For more information on pension and postretirement plans, refer to Note 11 - \"Benefit Plans\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. \nDividends\nThe amount and timing of dividends paid on IDACORP's common stock are within the discretion of IDACORP's board of directors. IDACORP's board of directors reviews the dividend rate periodically to determine its appropriateness in light of IDACORP's current and long-term financial position and results of operations, capital requirements, rating agency considerations, contractual and regulatory restrictions, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and Idaho Power in particular, competitive conditions, and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant. The ability of IDACORP to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power.\nIDACORP has a dividend policy that provides for a target long-term dividend payout ratio of between 50 and 60 percent of sustainable IDACORP earnings, with the flexibility to achieve that payout ratio over time and to adjust the payout ratio or to deviate from the target payout ratio from time to time based on the various factors that drive IDACORP's board of directors' dividend decisions. Notwithstanding the dividend policy adopted by IDACORP's board of directors, the dividends IDACORP pays remain in the discretion of the board of directors who, when evaluating the dividend amount, will continue to take into account the factors above, among others. In September of 2014, 2015, and 2016, IDACORP's board of directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share, $0.51 per share, and $0.55 per share of IDACORP common stock, respectively. IDACORP's dividends during 2016 were 53 percent of actual 2016 earnings.\nFor additional information relating to IDACORP and Idaho Power dividends, including restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends, see Note 6 - Common Stock\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nContingencies and Proceedings\nIDACORP and Idaho Power are involved in a number of litigation, alternative dispute resolution, and administrative proceedings, and are subject to claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, that could affect their future results of operations and financial condition. In many instances IDACORP and Idaho Power are unable to predict the outcomes of the matters or estimate the impact the proceedings may have on their financial positions, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIdaho Power is also actively monitoring various environmental regulations that may have a significant impact on its future operations. Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing, and compliance plans for these environmental matters, Idaho Power is unable to determine the financial impact of potential new regulations but does believe that future capital investment for infrastructure and modifications to its electric generating facilities to comply with these regulations could be significant.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough a self-bonding mechanism, Idaho Power guarantees its portion of reclamation activities and obligations at BCC, of which IERCo owns a one-third interest. This guarantee, which is renewed annually with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, was $71 million at December 31, 2016, representing IERCo's one-third share of BCC's total reclamation obligation of $212 million. BCC has a reclamation trust fund set aside specifically for the purpose of paying these reclamation costs. At December 31, 2016, the value of the reclamation trust fund totaled $78 million. During 2016, the reclamation trust fund distributed approximately $6 million for reclamation activity costs associated with the BCC surface mine. BCC periodically assesses the adequacy of the reclamation trust fund and its estimate of future reclamation costs. To ensure that the reclamation trust fund maintains adequate reserves, BCC adds a per-ton surcharge to coal sales. Because of the existence of the fund and the ability to apply a per-ton surcharge, the estimated fair value of this guarantee is minimal.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nIntroduction\nIdaho Power's regulatory strategy takes into consideration short-term and long-term needs for rate relief and involves several factors that can affect the timing of rate filings. These factors include, among others, in-service dates of major capital investments, the timing of changes in major revenue and expense items, and customer growth rates. Idaho Power's most recent general rate cases in Idaho and Oregon were filed during 2011, and Idaho Power filed a large single-issue rate case for the Langley Gulch power plant in Idaho and Oregon in 2012. These significant rate cases resulted in the resetting of base rates in both Idaho and Oregon during 2012. Idaho Power also reset its base-rate power supply expenses in the Idaho jurisdiction for purposes of updating the collection of costs through retail rates in 2014, but without a resulting net increase in rates. Between general rate cases, Idaho Power relies upon customer growth, power cost adjustment mechanisms, tariff riders, and other mechanisms to reduce the impact of regulatory lag, which refers to the period of time between making an investment or incurring an expense and recovering that investment or expense and earning a return. Management's regulatory focus in recent years has been largely on regulatory settlement stipulations and the design of rate mechanisms. During 2017, Idaho Power plans to continue to assess its need to file, and timing of, a general rate case in its two retail jurisdictions, based on its consideration of the factors described above.\nNotable Retail Rate Changes in Idaho and Oregon\nIncluded in the table that follows are notable regulatory developments during 2014, 2015, and 2016 that affected Idaho Power's results for the periods. Also refer to Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of regulatory mechanism and associated orders of the IPUC and OPUC, which should be read in conjunction with the discussion of regulatory matters in this MD&A.\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Annualized Revenue Impact (millions)(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014 Idaho FCA(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014 Idaho PCA(2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transfer of power supply costs from the Idaho PCA mechanism to Idaho base rates(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 Idaho FCA(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 Idaho PCA(2)(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 Idaho FCA(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 Idaho PCA(2)(6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) The annual amount collected in rates is typically not recovered on a linear basis (i.e., 1/12th per month), and is instead recovered in proportion to general business sales volumes.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) The rate changes for the Idaho PCA and FCA are applicable only for one-year periods.

In the general rate case, the IPUC issued an order approving a settlement stipulation that provided for an overall 7.86 percent authorized rate of return on an Idaho-jurisdiction rate base of approximately $2.36 billion. The settlement stipulation resulted in a $34.0 million overall increase in Idaho Power's annual Idaho-jurisdictional base rate revenues. Neither the IPUC's order nor the settlement stipulation specified an authorized rate of return on equity.\nEffective March 1, 2012, Idaho Power implemented new Oregon base rates resulting from its receipt of an order from the OPUC approving a settlement stipulation in its general rate case proceedings that provided for a $1.8 million base rate revenue increase, a rate of return on equity of 9.9 percent, and an overall rate of return of 7.757 percent in the Oregon jurisdiction.\nIdaho and Oregon base rates were subsequently adjusted again in 2012, in connection with Idaho Power's completion of the Langley Gulch power plant. In June 2012, the IPUC issued an order approving a $58.1 million increase in annual Idaho-jurisdiction base rate revenues, effective July 1, 2012, for inclusion of the investment and associated costs of the plant in rates. The order also provided for a $335.9 million increase in Idaho rate base. On September 20, 2012, the OPUC issued an order approving a $3.0 million increase in annual Oregon jurisdiction base rate revenues, effective October 1, 2012, for inclusion of the investment and associated costs of the plant in Oregon rates.\nIn March 2014, the IPUC issued an order approving Idaho Power's application requesting an increase of approximately $106 million in the normalized or \"base level\" net power supply expense on a total-system basis to be used to update base rates and in the determination of the PCA rate that became effective June 1, 2014. Approval of the order removed the Idaho-jurisdictional portion of those expenses (approximately $99 million) from collection via the PCA mechanism and instead results in collecting that portion through base rates.\nNon-Base Rate Idaho Regulatory Settlement Stipulations\nSettlement Stipulation for 2012 to 2014: In December 2011, the IPUC issued an order, separate from the then-pending Idaho general rate case proceeding, approving a settlement stipulation that allowed Idaho Power to, in certain circumstances, amortize additional ADITC if Idaho Power's actual Idaho ROE for 2012, 2013, or 2014 was less than 9.5 percent, to help achieve a 9.5 percent Idaho ROE for the applicable year. The more specific terms and conditions of the December 2011 Idaho settlement stipulation are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters - Notable Idaho Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Under the December 2011 settlement stipulation, when Idaho Power's actual Idaho ROE for any of those years exceeded 10.0 percent, Idaho Power was required to share a portion of its Idaho-jurisdiction earnings with Idaho customers.\nSettlement Stipulation for 2015 to 2019: In October 2014, the IPUC issued an order approving an extension, with modifications, of the terms of the December 2011 settlement stipulation for the period from 2015 through 2019, or until the terms are otherwise modified or terminated by order of the IPUC or the full $45 million of additional ADITC contemplated by the settlement stipulation has been amortized. The more specific terms and conditions of the October 2014 settlement stipulation are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters - Notable Idaho Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. IDACORP and Idaho Power believe that the terms allowing amortization of additional ADITC in the October 2014 settlement stipulation provide the companies with a greater degree of earnings stability than would be possible without the terms of the stipulation in effect.\nIn 2016, Idaho Power's Idaho ROE was between 9.5 and 10.0 percent, and thus Idaho Power recorded no additional ADITC amortization and no provision for sharing with customers. Accordingly, at December 31, 2016, the full $45 million of additional ADITC remains available for future use under the terms of the settlement stipulation.\nIdaho Power recorded the following for sharing with customers under the December 2011 and October 2014 Idaho Settlement Stipulations (in millions):\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded as Refunds to Customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recorded as a Pre-tax Charge to Pension Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$14.6\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nModifications to Idaho Annual Rate Adjustment Mechanisms\nPCA Mechanism: In July 2014, the IPUC opened a docket pursuant to which Idaho Power, the IPUC Staff, and other interested parties evaluated Idaho Power's application of the true-up component of the PCA mechanism. The July 2014 docket arose from a prior order of the IPUC, which noted that the IPUC Staff believed that Idaho Power's application of the true-up component introduced a line-loss bias that inflated the true-up revenue that Idaho Power collects under the PCA. In May 2015, the IPUC approved a settlement stipulation that modified the calculation of the true-up component of the PCA mechanism. The mechanics of the PCA mechanism and the terms of the PCA settlement stipulation are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nFCA Mechanism:Also in July 2014, the IPUC opened a docket to allow Idaho Power, the IPUC Staff, and other interested parties to further evaluate the IPUC Staff's concerns regarding the application of the FCA. Concerns cited included the application of weather-normalization, the customer count methodology, the rate adjustment cap, cross-subsidization issues, and whether the FCA is in fact effectively removing Idaho Power's disincentive to aggressively pursue energy efficiency programs.\nThe FCA is designed to remove Idaho Power's financial disincentive to invest in energy efficiency programs by separating (or decoupling) the recovery of fixed costs from the variable kilowatt-hour charge and linking it instead to a set amount per customer. Stated generally, under the FCA Idaho Power charges residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less \"actual fixed costs per customer\" than the base level of fixed costs that the IPUC authorized for recovery through rates in the last general rate case, and Idaho Power credits those customers when its \"actual fixed costs per customer\" recovered exceed that base level of fixed costs. The FCA is adjusted each year to collect, or refund, the difference between the authorized fixed-cost recovery amount and the actual fixed costs recovered by Idaho Power during the year.\nIn years when actual sales per customer are higher than weather-normalized sales due to high summer or low winter temperatures, Idaho Power expects that the new FCA methodology will be less favorable to Idaho Power than the prior methodology. Conversely, Idaho Power expects that the new FCA methodology will be more favorable to Idaho Power in years when actual sales per customer are lower than weather normalized sales due to cooler summer or warmer winter temperatures.\nDeferred Net Power Supply Costs\nDeferred power supply costs represent certain differences between Idaho Power's actual net power supply costs and the costs included in its retail rates, the latter being based on annual forecasts of power supply costs. Deferred power supply costs are recorded on the balance sheets for future recovery or refund through customer rates. Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions provide for annual adjustments to the rates charged to retail customers. The power cost adjustment mechanisms and associated financial impacts are described in \"Results of Operations\" in this MD&A and in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nFactors that have influenced power cost adjustment rate changes in recent years include year-to-year volatility in hydroelectric generation conditions, market energy prices and the volume of off-system sales, power purchase costs from renewable energy projects, and revenue sharing under Idaho regulatory settlement stipulations. From year to year, these factors can vary significantly, which can result in significant accruals and deferrals under the power cost adjustment mechanisms. The power cost adjustment rate changes reflected in the table under the heading \"Notable Retail Rate Changes in Idaho and Oregon\" are illustrative of the volatility of net power supply costs and the impact on power cost adjustment rates.\nAs noted above under the heading \"Idaho and Oregon General Rate Cases and Base Rate Adjustments,\" in light of the existence of permanent increases in power supply costs, in March 2014 the IPUC issued an order approving Idaho Power's application requesting recovery of a portion of its ongoing power supply costs through base rates rather than through the PCA mechanism.\nThe following table summarizes the change in deferred net power supply costs over the prior two years.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Idaho\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Oregon(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current period net power supply costs deferred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue sharing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,999\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,999\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy efficiency rider funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior amounts recovered through rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,519\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,294\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SO2 allowance and renewable energy certificate (REC) sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current period net power supply costs deferred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue sharing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy efficiency rider funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior amounts recovered through rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,818\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SO2 allowance and renewable energy certificate (REC) sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(915\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>683\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Oregon power supply cost deferrals are subject to a statute that specifically limits rate amortizations of deferred costs to six percent of gross Oregon revenue per year (approximately $3 million).

Idaho Power can defer costs incurred until the earlier of when Idaho Power requests recovery of the costs and the deferral balance or the end of 2018. Idaho Power anticipates that it will begin participating in the Western EIM in the spring of 2018. The Western EIM is intended to reduce the power supply costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, to integrate intermittent power from renewable generation sources more effectively, and to enhance reliability. Refer to Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to Idaho Power's anticipated participation in the Western EIM.\nOpen Access Transmission Tariff Rate Proceedings\nIdaho Power uses a formula rate for transmission service provided under its OATT, which allows transmission rates to be updated annually based primarily on financial and operational data Idaho Power files with the FERC. In August 2016, Idaho Power filed its 2016 final transmission rate with the FERC, reflecting a transmission rate of $25.52 per kW-year, to be effective for the period from October 1, 2016, to September 30, 2017. Idaho Power's final rate was based on a net annual transmission revenue requirement of $127.4 million. Historic OATT rate information is included in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nTransmission Revenues Associated with Asset Exchange Transaction\nEffective in October 2015, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp each transferred to the other certain interests in transmission-related equipment. In connection with that transaction, the companies terminated or amended a number of long-term agreements between Idaho Power and PacifiCorp related to the ownership and operation of transmission-related equipment and transmission services. In 2014, Idaho Power collected approximately $8 million in transmission revenues under long-term transmission agreements that were terminated in connection with the asset exchange transaction. As a result of the transaction and termination of those long-term transmission agreements, Idaho Power's OATT rate increased; however, in accordance with a FERC order, the current formula rate methodology will phase in the increase over a two-year period from October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2018.\nIn compliance with the IPUC's order approving the asset exchange transaction, Idaho Power submitted to the IPUC a request for verification that its regulatory accounting method reflecting a symmetrical tracking of changes in transmission revenues resulting specifically from the asset exchange with PacifiCorp complies with the IPUC's order. As an alternative proposed by Idaho Power to its symmetrical tracking, in August 2016, the IPUC ordered that any changes in transmission revenues resulting from the asset exchange will be addressed, prospectively, in Idaho Power's next general rate case.\nDepreciation Rate Requests\nIn October and November 2016, Idaho Power filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC, respectively, requesting authorization to (a) accelerate depreciation for the North Valmy coal-fired power plant, to allow the plant to be fully depreciated by December 31, 2025, (b) establish a balancing account to track the incremental costs and benefits associated with the accelerated depreciation date, and (c) adjust customer rates to recover the associated incremental annual levelized revenue requirement in an aggregate amount of $29.6 million. Idaho Power also filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC requesting approval to institute revised depreciation rates for Idaho Power's other electric plant-in-service and adjust base rates by an aggregate of $7.4 million to reflect the revised depreciation rates applied to electric plant-in-service balances subject to the most recent general rate case. The depreciation filings are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRelicensing of Hydroelectric Projects\nOverview: Idaho Power, like other utilities that operate non-federal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways, obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the FERC. These licenses have a term of 30 to 50 years depending on the size, complexity, and cost of the project. The expiration dates for the FERC licenses for each of the facilities are included in Part I - Item 2 - \"Properties\" in this report. Costs for the relicensing of Idaho Power's hydroelectric projects are recorded in construction work in progress until a new multi-year license is issued by the FERC, at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service. Idaho Power will submit relicensing costs and costs related to new licenses to regulators for recovery\nthrough the ratemaking process and, in December 2016, submitted a request for a determination of prudency, which is described below. As of December 31, 2016, relicensing costs of $249 million for the HCC, Idaho Power's largest hydroelectric complex and a major relicensing effort, were included in construction work in progress. As of the date of this report, the IPUC authorizes Idaho Power to include in its Idaho jurisdiction rates approximately $6.5 million annually ($10.7 million when grossed-up for the effect of income taxes) of AFUDC relating to the HCC relicensing project. Collecting these amounts now will reduce the amount collected in the future once the HCC relicensing costs are approved for recovery in base rates. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power's regulatory liability for collection of AFUDC relating to the HCC was $103 million. In addition to the discussion below, refer to \"Environmental Matters\" in this MD&A for a discussion of environmental compliance under FERC licenses for Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating plants.\nHells Canyon Complex: The HCC, located on the Snake River where it forms the border between Idaho and Oregon, provides approximately 68 percent of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating nameplate capacity and 32 percent of its total generating nameplate capacity. In July 2003, Idaho Power filed an application with the FERC for a new license in anticipation of the July 2005 expiration of the then-existing license. Since the expiration of that license, Idaho Power has been operating the project under annual licenses issued by the FERC. In December 2004, Idaho Power and eleven other parties, including National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), involved in the HCC relicensing process entered into an interim agreement that addresses the effects of the ongoing operations of the HCC on Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed species pending the relicensing of the project. In August 2007, the FERC Staff issued a final EIS for the HCC, which the FERC will use to determine whether, and under what conditions, to issue a new license for the project. The purpose of the final EIS is to inform the FERC, federal and state agencies, Native American tribes, and the public about the environmental effects of Idaho Power's operation of the HCC. Certain portions of the final EIS involve issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and formal consultations under the ESA, which remain unresolved.\nIn connection with its relicensing efforts, Idaho Power has filed water quality certification applications, required under Section 401 of the CWA, with the states of Idaho and Oregon requesting that each state certify that any discharges from the project comply with applicable state water quality standards. Section 401 of the CWA requires that a state either approve or deny a Section 401 water quality certification application within one year of the filing of the application or the state may be considered to have waived its certification authority under the CWA. As a consequence, Idaho Power has been filing and withdrawing its Section 401 certification applications with Oregon and Idaho on an annual basis while it has been working with the states to identify measures that will provide reasonable assurance that discharges from the HCC will adequately address applicable water quality standards. In the 2016 Section 401 certification application process, Oregon required Idaho Power to comply with fish passage and reintroduction conditions. Idaho's water quality certification, however, specifically forbids Idaho Power from reintroducing certain fish protected under the ESA, into Idaho's waters. On November 30, 2016, Idaho Power filed a petition with the FERC requesting that the FERC resolve the conflict between Oregon's and Idaho's conditions and declare that the FPA pre-empts the Oregon state law. In January 2017, the FERC issued an order denying Idaho Power's petition, stating that the petition for a declaratory order was premature, cannot realistically be considered separately from the issue of the states' certification authority under the CWA Section 401, and raises issues that are beyond the FERC's authority to decide. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power is considering other actions it may take to obtain a resolution of the issue.\nIn September 2007, in connection with the issuance of its final EIS, the FERC notified the NMFS and the USFWS of its determination that the licensing of the HCC was likely to adversely affect ESA-listed species, including the bull trout and fall Chinook salmon and steelhead, under the NMFS's and USFWS's jurisdiction and requested that the NMFS and USFWS initiate formal consultation under Section 7 of the ESA on the licensing of the HCC. Each of the NMFS and USFWS responded to the FERC that the conditions relating to the licensing of the HCC were not fully described or developed in the final EIS as the measures to address the water quality effects of the project were yet to be fully defined by the Section 401 certification process. The NMFS and USFWS therefore recommended that formal consultation under the ESA be delayed until the Section 401 certification process is completed.\nIdaho Power continues to work with Idaho and Oregon in the development of measures to provide reasonable assurance that any discharges from the HCC will comply with applicable state water quality standards so that appropriate water quality certifications can be issued for the project, and continues to cooperate with the USFWS, NMFS, and the FERC in an effort to address ESA concerns. Idaho Power has begun the process for construction of new aerated runners at the Brownlee project (part of the HCC) at an estimated cost of $50 million. The first of four units was installed in 2016 and Idaho Power plans to install one unit in each year from 2017 through 2019. Other measures that have been proposed or considered have included modification of spillways at two dams in the HCC to address total dissolved gas issues, and upstream watershed improvements or the installation of a temperature control structure to address water temperatures during a small portion of the year. If Idaho Power is required to take these or other additional measures to satisfy relicensing requirements, it could add substantially to\nproject costs. Idaho Power continues to work with the Oregon and Idaho Departments of Environmental Quality on the water quality certification issue and the water quality measures that will be required to obtain 401 certification.\nAs of the date of this report, Idaho Power is unable to predict the timing of issuance by the FERC of any license order or the ultimate capital investment and ongoing operating and maintenance costs Idaho Power will incur in complying with any new license. However, as of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates that the annual costs it will incur to obtain a new long-term license for the HCC, including AFUDC but excluding costs expected to be incurred for complying with the license after issuance, are likely to range from $25 million to $35 million until issuance of the license, which Idaho Power estimates will occur no earlier than 2021. In light of the costs incurred and the considerable passage of time, in December 2016, Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC requesting a determination that Idaho Power's expenditures of $220.8 million through year-end 2015 on relicensing of the HCC were prudently incurred, and thus eligible for future inclusion in retail rates.\nRenewable Energy Standards and Contracts\nRenewable Portfolio Standards: Numerous proponents have introduced legislation in the U.S. Congress that would require electric utilities to obtain a specified percentage of their electricity from renewable sources, commonly referred to as a \"renewable portfolio standard\" or \"RPS.\" However, as of the date of this report no federal or State of Idaho RPS is in effect. Idaho Power will be required to comply with a five- or ten-percent RPS in Oregon beginning in 2025 (depending on loads at that time), and Idaho Power expects to meet either RPS requirement with Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) obtained from the purchase of power from the Elkhorn Valley wind project.\nPursuant to an IPUC order, Idaho Power is selling its near-term RECs and returning to customers their share (shared 95% with customers in the Idaho jurisdiction) of those proceeds through the PCA. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, Idaho Power's REC sales totaled $1.0 million, $1.8 million, and $3.2 million, respectively. The comparative decrease in REC sales resulted primarily from the elimination of a REC purchase and sale agreement with a third party.\nWere Idaho Power to be subject to additional RPS legislation, it may cease in full or in part the sale of RECs it receives, seek to obtain RECs from additional projects, generate RECs from any REC-generating facilities it owns or may be required to construct in light of an RPS, or purchase RECs in the market. Historically, Idaho Power has generally not received the RECs associated with PURPA projects. However, an order issued by the IPUC in December 2012, described below, provides that Idaho Power will own a portion of the RECs generated by some PURPA projects. The required purchase of additional RECs to meet RPS requirements would increase Idaho Power's costs, which Idaho Power expects would be wholly or largely passed on to customers through rates and the power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nRenewable and Other Energy Contracts: Idaho Power has contracts for the purchase of power from both CSPP projects under PURPA and non-CSPP renewable generation sources such as biomass, wind, solar, small hydroelectric projects, and two geothermal projects. Idaho Power purchases wind power from both CSPP and non-CSPP facilities, including its largest non-CSPP wind power project-the Elkhorn Valley wind project with a 101-MW nameplate capacity. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power had contracts to purchase energy from 117 on-line CSPP projects, twelve additional projects expected to come on-line in 2017, and three projects expected to come on-line in 2019. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016, the resource type and nameplate capacity of Idaho Power's signed CSPP and non-CSPP related agreements. These agreements have original contract terms ranging from one to 35 years.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resource Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total On-line (MW)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Began operating during 2016 (MW)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Under Contract but not yet On-line (MW)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Projects under Contract (MW)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CSPP:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wind\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Solar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hydroelectric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CSPP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,132\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-CSPP:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wind\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Geothermal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-CSPP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll but three of the projects not yet on-line are expected to be on-line no later than mid-year 2017 (three solar projects are scheduled to be on-line in 2019).\nIn April 2015, Idaho Power made filings with the OPUC requesting, among other things, a reduction in the term of standard PURPA power purchase agreements from 20 years to two years for projects above 100 kW, in a manner consistent with its Idaho jurisdiction where the IPUC reduced the length of PURPA contracts that involve avoided-cost-based pricing to two years, and a temporary suspension of Idaho Power's obligation to enter into new fixed-price standard PURPA agreements during the pendency of the proceedings. In March 2016, the OPUC issued an order permanently reducing the eligibility cap for solar project standard contracts to 3 MW, with all other resource types retaining an eligibility cap of 10 MW. In its order, the OPUC retained the requirement for up to 20-year contract lengths for Oregon jurisdictional projects, comprised of 15 years of fixed prices and five years of market index prices.\nIn June 2016, the FERC held a technical conference on implementation issues under PURPA, including the mandatory power purchase obligation and the methods for determining avoided costs for those purchases. The conference also involved a discussion of PURPA project siting issues and minimum contract term lengths. In September 2016, the FERC filed a notice inviting post-technical conference comments on (1) the use of the \"one-mile rule\" to determine the size of an entity seeking certification as a small power production qualifying facility and (2) minimum standards for PURPA-purchase contracts. In November 2016, Idaho Power provided comments to the FERC specifically addressing Idaho Power's position regarding the two items of which the FERC invited comments. Idaho Power is unable to predict what policy or rulemaking actions or proceedings, if any, on PURPA-related issues will result from the technical conference.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nOverview\nIdaho Power is subject to a broad range of federal, state, regional, and local laws and regulations designed to protect, restore, and enhance the environment, including the CAA, the CWA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and the ESA, among other laws. These laws are administered by a number of federal, state, and local agencies. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and associated costs, these laws and regulations provide authority to regulators to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, injunctive relief, and other sanctions. Idaho Power's three co-owned coal-fired power plants and three natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants are subject to many of these regulations. Idaho Power's 17 hydroelectric projects are also further subject to a number of water discharge standards and other environmental requirements.\nCompliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may:\n \u2022 increase the operating costs of generating plants; \n \u2022 increase the construction costs and lead time for new facilities; \n \u2022 require the modification of existing generating plants, which could result in additional costs; \n \u2022 require the curtailment or shut-down of existing generating plants; or \n \u2022 reduce the output from current generating facilities. \nCurrent and future environmental laws and regulations will increase the cost of operating fossil fuel-fired generation plants and constructing new generation and transmission facilities, in large part through the substantial cost of permitting activities and the required installation of additional pollution control devices. In many parts of the United States, some higher-cost, high-emission coal-fired plants have ceased operation or the plant owners have announced a near-term cessation of operation, as the cost of compliance makes the plants uneconomical to operate. The decision to agree to cease operation of the Boardman coal-fired plant, in which Idaho Power owns a 10 percent interest, by the end of 2020, was based in part on the significant future cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC and OPUC in October and November 2016, respectively, requesting accelerated depreciation of the North Valmy plant in connection with the potential early closure of the plant. Additionally, in light of the uncertainty resulting from pending environmental regulation and the substantial estimated cost of SCR controls, Idaho Power is assessing whether to move forward with the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant.\nIn addition to increasing costs generally, these environmental laws and regulations could affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition if the costs associated with these environmental requirements and early plant retirements cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis. Part I, Item 1 - Business - Utility Operations - Environmental Regulation and Costs\u201d in this report includes a summary of Idaho Power's expected capital and operating expenditures for environmental matters during the period from 2017 to 2019. Given the uncertainty of future environmental regulations and technological advances, Idaho Power is unable to predict its environmental-related expenditures beyond 2019, though they could be substantial. Furthermore, the recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation, and government policy regarding environmental matters. Idaho Power may delay making operational changes or environmental-related expenditures while such changes are pending to avoid implementing uncertain laws, rules, and policies.\nEndangered Species Act Matters\nOverview: The listing of a species of fish, wildlife, or plants as threatened or endangered under the ESA may have an adverse impact on Idaho Power's ability to construct generation, transmission, or distribution facilities or relicense or operate its hydroelectric facilities. When a species is added to the federal list of threatened and endangered species, it is protected from take,\u201d which is defined to include harming the species. The ESA directs that, concurrent with a designation of a threatened or endangered species, and where prudent and determinable, the applicable agencies also designate any habitat of such species which is then considered to be critical habitat.\u201d The ESA also provides that each federal agency must ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat. If an action is determined to result in adverse modification of critical habitat, the federal agency must adopt changes to the proposed action to avoid the adverse modification. These changes are often quite extensive and can affect the size, scope, and even the feasibility of a project moving forward. In February 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the NMFS issued a set of regulatory and policy changes relating to critical habitat and adverse modification determinations under the ESA. While the ultimate impact of implementation of those changes is yet to be determined, taken as a whole, Idaho Power believes that the changes could result in the applicable agencies having greater authority in making designations of critical habitat and could increase the likelihood of adverse modification determinations.\nThe construction of generation, transmission, or distribution facilities and the relicensing of Idaho Power's hydroelectric projects can be federally authorized actions that fall under the ESA. There are a number of threatened or endangered species within Idaho Power's service area and within or near proposed transmission line routes, including the slickspot peppergrass. Further, there are a number of ESA-listed fish and other aquatic species located in waterways in which Idaho Power has hydroelectric facilities, including fall Chinook salmon, bull trout, Bliss Rapids snail, and Snake River physa snail. To date, efforts to protect these and other listed species have not significantly affected generation levels or operating costs at any of Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities. However, the ongoing relicensing of the HCC presents endangered species and fisheries issues that may require operational adjustments and could adversely impact the amount of output from hydroelectric dams, potentially causing Idaho Power to rely on more expensive sources for power generation or market purchases.\nDevelopments in Regulation of Sage Grouse Habitat: In February 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of Idaho challenging the BLM's sage grouse resource management and land use plan revisions that became effective in 2015 under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The lawsuit challenges the plans and associated environmental impact statements across the sage grouse range and alleges that the plans fail to ensure that sage grouse populations and habitats will be protected and restored in accordance with the best available science and legal mandates. Further, the complaint challenges certain exemptions provided for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects. Idaho Power has intervened in the proceedings in an effort to support the exemptions provided for in the BLM's plans.\nIn May 2016, a separate lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of North Dakota, challenging the BLM's sage grouse resource management and land use plan revisions, including the exemptions provided for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects. In October 2016, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to no longer challenge the exemptions; however, in December 2016, the North Dakota court transfered claims challenging certain Idaho land use plan amendments to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power is participating in the proceedings in an effort to protect its interests.\nESA Issues Related to Specific Projects:\nHells Canyon Relicensing Project: In 2007, the FERC requested initiation of formal consultation under the ESA with the NMFS and the USFWS regarding potential effects of HCC relicensing on several listed aquatic and terrestrial species. Formal consultation has yet to be initiated and the NMFS and the USFWS continue to gather and consider information relative to the effects of relicensing on relevant ESA listed species. Idaho Power continues to cooperate with the USFWS, the NMFS, and the FERC in an effort to address ESA concerns. In December 2004, Idaho Power and eleven other parties, including NMFS and the USFWS, entered into an interim agreement that addresses the effects of the ongoing operations of the HCC on ESA listed species pending the relicensing of the project. At the conclusion of formal consultation and with the issuance of biological opinions by the NMFS and the USFWS and an operating license by the FERC, Idaho Power may be required to implement additional measures or further modify or adjust operations to comply with Section 7 of the ESA. The issuance of a final biological opinion during 2017 is unlikely.\nBoardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West Transmission Projects: In August 2016, the USFWS re-instated the threatened species status of slickspot peppergrass. Most of the species are located on federal land. Idaho Power expects the listing of the slickspot peppergrass and its existence within or near the proposed routes for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects to continue to impact the cost and timing of permitting and construction of the projects, as it requires an ESA Section 7 consultation. The USFWS has also indicated it intends to designate critical habitat for the species. If critical habitat is designated within the vicinity of the transmission line projects, Idaho Power expects that the designation could increase the cost of obtaining permits for the projects and could further delay the in-service date of the projects.\nEndangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act Developments: In May 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon issued an opinion finding that in the context of hydroelectric facilities owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and located on the lower Snake River, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) violated the ESA by using improper standards, failing to consider adequately the impact of climate change on habitat conditions, and placing undue reliance on unproven, future federal habitat conservation measures, particularly to the degree that the success of the measures could be undermined by climate change. The court also found that other federal agencies violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by failing to prepare a comprehensive environmental impact statement on implementation of the conservation measures ordered by NOAA Fisheries, including analysis of the measures directed by NOAA Fisheries and other reasonable alternatives. The court's opinion and its emphasis on a climate change-driven analysis element, if generalized to other situations, could require ESA-driven avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation efforts to incorporate surplus measures to ensure species' protection, which could result in considerable increases in cost beyond the cost of additional analysis in the NEPA process. In September 2016, federal agencies initiated an environmental impact statement process to examine hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake River, which Idaho Power expects will take place over a five-year period. None of Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities are included in the studies.\nClimate Change and the Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nOverview: Long-term climate change could significantly affect Idaho Power's business in a variety of ways, including:\n \u2022 changes in temperature and precipitation could affect customer demand and energy loads; \n \u2022 extreme weather events could increase service interruptions, outages, maintenance costs, and the need for additional backup systems, and can affect the supply of, and demand for, electricity and natural gas, which may impact the price of those and other commodities; \n \u2022 changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows could adversely affect hydroelectric generation; \n \u2022 legislative and/or regulatory developments related to climate change could affect plants and operations, including restrictions on the construction of new generation resources, the expansion of existing resources, or the operation of generation resources; and \n \u2022 consumer preference for, and resource planning decisions requiring, renewable or low GHG-emitting sources of energy could impact usage of existing generation sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission infrastructure. \nFederal and state regulations pertaining to GHG emissions under the CAA have raised uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels, most notably coal, as an economical energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities because many new technologies for reducing CO2 emissions from coal, including carbon capture and storage, are still in the development stage and are not yet proven. Stringent emissions standards could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, which may accelerate the retirement of coal-fired units and create power system reliability issues. Some higher-cost, high-emission coal-fired plants have ceased operation or the plant owners have announced a near-term cessation of operation, as the cost of compliance makes the plants uneconomical to operate, particularly in light of continued low natural gas prices that decrease the cost to operate natural gas-fired power plants.\nA variety of factors contribute to the financial, regulatory, and logistical uncertainties related to GHG reductions. These include the specific GHG emissions limits imposed, the timing of implementation of these limits, the level of emissions allowances allocated and the level that must be purchased, the purchase price of emissions allowances, the development and commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions, the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance, provisions for cost containment (if any), the impact on coal and natural gas prices, and the timing and amount of cost recovery through rates. Accordingly, Idaho Power cannot predict the effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of any GHG emission or other climate change requirements that may be adopted, although the costs to implement and comply with any such requirements could be substantial. A more detailed discussion of legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change follows.\nNational GHG Initiatives; Final Rule Under CAA Section 111(d): The EPA has become increasingly active in the regulation of GHGs. The EPA's endangerment finding in 2009 that GHGs threaten public health and welfare resulted in the enactment of a series of EPA regulations to address GHG emissions.\nIn May 2010, the EPA issued the Tailoring Rule,\u201d which set thresholds for GHG emissions that define when permits are required for new and existing industrial facilities. The final rule tailors\u201d the requirements of these CAA permitting programs to limit which facilities will be required to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permits. The rules require the use of \"best available control technology\" for GHG emissions if a new major source or modification of an existing major source is projected to result in GHG emissions of at least 75,000 tons per year (CO2 equivalent). In addition, Title V permit renewals or modifications for existing major sources must include applicable requirements relating to GHGs. While the rules are complex, Idaho Power believes that its owned and co-owned fossil fuel-fired generation plants are, as of the date of this report, in compliance with the GHG Tailoring Rule.\nIn June 2014, the EPA released, under Section 111(d) of the CAA, a proposed rule for addressing GHG from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs). The proposed rule was intended to achieve a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from the power sector by 2030. On August 3, 2015, the EPA released the final rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA, referred to as the Clean Power Plan, which requires states to adopt plans to collectively reduce 2005 levels of power sector CO2 emissions by 32 percent by the year 2030. The final rule provides states until September 2018 to submit implementation plans, phasing in several compliance periods beginning in 2022 and achieving the final emissions goals by 2030.\nOn February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order staying the implementation of the rule pending the completion of certain legal challenges, which has an uncertain impact on the ultimate timeline for implementation of the rule. Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generation facilities are in the states of Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming. Despite the current stay on implementation, Idaho Power is working with state representatives, neighboring utilities, and others as it analyzes the rule and prepares for compliance. Because the rule is premised on state implementation plans, the terms of which Idaho Power does not control, and due to the potential changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy with respect to environmental matters as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional elections, as of the date of this report Idaho Power is unable to determine the financial or operational impacts of the final rule.\nState GHG Initiatives and Idaho Power's Voluntary GHG Reduction Initiative: In August 2007, the Oregon legislature enacted legislation setting goals of reducing GHG levels to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 75 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Oregon imposes GHG emission reporting requirements on facilities emitting 2,500 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent annually. The Boardman coal-fired power plant located in Oregon, in which Idaho Power is a 10-percent owner, is subject to and in compliance with Oregon's GHG reporting requirements but is scheduled to cease coal-fired operations in 2020.\nIn Oregon, legislation referred to as the Oregon Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Plan was enacted in March 2016, and may require certain large Oregon utilities to remove coal-fired generation from their Oregon retail rates by 2030. Oregon utilities would be permitted to sell the output of coal-fired plants into the wholesale market or reallocate such plants to other states. To the extent Idaho Power is subject to the legislation, it plans to seek recovery, through the ratemaking process, of operating and capitalized costs related to its coal-fired generation assets and removal of any of those assets from Oregon rate base.\nThe State of Idaho has not passed legislation specifically regulating GHGs, but in May 2007, Idaho's governor issued Executive Order 2007-05, which directed the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to work with the state government to implement GHG reductions within each agency, complete a statewide emissions inventory, and provide recommendations to the governor, among other tasks. Wyoming and Nevada similarly have not enacted legislation to regulate GHG emissions and do not have a reporting requirement, but they are members of the Climate Registry, a national, voluntary GHG emission reporting system. The Climate Registry is a collaboration aimed at developing and managing a common GHG emission reporting system across states, provinces, and tribes to track GHG emissions nationally. All states for which Idaho Power has traditional fuel generating plants (i.e. Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming, and Nevada) are members of the Climate Registry. Idaho Power is engaged in voluntary GHG emissions intensity reduction efforts, which is discussed in Part I, Item 1 - Business - Utility Operations - Environmental Regulation and Costs.\"\nClean Air Act Matters\nOverview: In addition to the CAA developments related to GHG emissions described above, several other regulatory programs developed under the CAA apply to Idaho Power. These include the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), New Source Review / Prevention of Significant Deterioration (NSR/PSD)\nRules, and the Regional Haze Rule.\nMATS Implementation: The final MATS rule under the CAA, previously referred to as the Utility MACT Rule, was issued in February 2012. The final rule established emission limits for hazardous air pollutants from new and existing coal-fired and oil-fired steam electric generating units. The MATS rule provided that sources must be in compliance with emission limits by April 2015. Idaho Power and the plant co-owners have installed mercury continuous emission monitoring systems on all of the coal-fired units at the Jim Bridger, Boardman, and North Valmy coal-fired generating plants, along with control technology to reduce mercury, acid gases, and particulate matter emissions for purposes of compliance with the MATS rule. Idaho Power believes that as of the date of this report, the coal-fired plants are in compliance with the MATS rule. Legal challenges relating to the MATS rule, to which Idaho Power is not a party and pursuant to which the EPA is performing a court-mandated cost analysis for the rule, are pending.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards: The CAA requires the EPA to set ambient air quality standards for six \"criteria\" pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. These six pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. States are then required to develop emission reduction strategies through State Implementation Plans, or SIPs, based on attainment of these ambient air quality standards. Recent developments and pending actions related to certain of those items relevant to Idaho Power include the following:\n \u2022 NOx: In 2010, the EPA adopted a new NAAQS for NOx at a level of 100 parts per billion averaged over a 1-hour period. In connection with the new NAAQS, in February 2012 the EPA issued a final rule designating all of the counties in Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming where Idaho Power owns or has an interest in a natural gas or coal-fired power plant as unclassifiable/attainment\u201d for NOx. The EPA indicated it would review the designations after 2015, when three years of air quality monitoring data are available, and may formally designate the counties as attainment or non-attainment for NOx. A designation of non-attainment may increase the likelihood that Idaho Power would be required to install costly pollution control technology at one or more of its plants. \n \u2022 SO2: In 2010, the EPA adopted a new NAAQS for SO2 at a level of 75 parts per billion averaged over a one-hour period. In 2011, the states of Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming sent letters to the EPA recommending that all counties in these states be classified as \"unclassifiable\" under the new one-hour SO2 NAAQS because of a lack of definitive monitoring and modeling data. In February 2013, the EPA issued letters to the states of Idaho and Oregon, finding that the most recent air quality data for those states showed no violations of the 2010 SO2 standard. As a result, the EPA is waiting to propose designation actions for those states, and is likely to proceed with designation actions once additional data is gathered. Idaho Power expects that designations for Nevada and Wyoming will also be addressed in a separate future action. \n \u2022 Ozone: In late 2014, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would update the ozone standard under the CAA, from 75 parts per billion over an eight-hour period to 65 to 70 parts per billion over an eight-hour period. On October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the national ozone standard under the CAA to 70 parts per billion. The EPA stated that the vast majority of U.S. counties will meet the standards by 2025 with federal and state rules and programs now in place or underway. The EPA's plan provides for finalizing non-attainment designations in 2017, and it plans to propose rules and guidance over the next year to help states with potential non-attainment areas implement the revised standards. Non-attainment areas will have until 2020 to late 2037 to meet the new standard, with attainment dates varying based on the ozone level in the area. Due to high levels of background ozone, which can be caused by factors such as elevation, vegetation, wildfire, and international transport, attainment in areas within the Intermountain West may be difficult, and the formulation of state implementation plans to bring an area into compliance with the new standard may be challenging due to the existence of ozone caused by factors outside of local control. If the EPA were to make non-attainment determinations in areas where Idaho Power owns or co-owns power plants, or proposes to construct power plants, the state implementation plan for those areas could result in changes to the nature and frequency of operation of existing generation plants and make more difficult or costly the construction of new power generation plants. Idaho Power will seek to work with state regulators on implementation plans for any non-attainment areas, in an effort to reduce the potential adverse impact on Idaho Power's operation of its existing power generation plants and construction of future facilities. \nBecause the EPA has not yet completed the designation of areas as attaining or not attaining the NAAQS for NOx, SO2, and ozone, Idaho Power is unable to predict what impact the adoption and implementation of these standards may have on its operations, though it does expect at least some increases in capital and operating costs from the standards if areas in which Idaho Power operate, or adjacent areas, receive non-attainment designations.\nRegional Haze Rules: In accordance with federal regional haze rules under the CAA, coal-fired utility boilers are subject to regional haze - best available retrofit technology (RH BART) if they were built between 1962 and 1977 and affect any \"Class I\" (wilderness) areas. This includes all four units at the Jim Bridger and the Boardman coal-fired plants. The RH BART rules would have required installation of a suite of emissions controls at the Boardman plant; however, in December 2010, the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission approved a plan to install a less costly suite of environmental controls and cease coal-fired operations at the Boardman power plant no later than December 31, 2020.\nIn December 2009, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) issued a RH BART permit to PacifiCorp as the operator of the Jim Bridger plant. As part of the WDEQ's long term strategy for regional haze, the permit required that PacifiCorp install SCR equipment for NOx control at Jim Bridger units 3 and 4 by December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which has been completed, and submit an application by December 31, 2017 to install add-on NOx controls at Jim Bridger unit 2 by 2021 and unit 1 by 2022. In November 2010, PacifiCorp and the WDEQ signed a settlement agreement under\nwhich PacifiCorp agreed to the timing and nature of the controls. The settlement agreement was conditioned on the EPA ultimately approving those portions of the Wyoming regional haze SIP that are consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. In January 2014, the EPA approved Wyoming's regional haze SIP as to the Jim Bridger plant, with the NOx control compliance dates set forth in the settlement agreement. Several interested parties have appealed the EPA's decisions on Wyoming's regional haze SIP on various grounds. Idaho Power has not appealed the EPA's decisions but has intervened in the proceedings to participate if and to the extent the Jim Bridger plant could be affected.\nClean Water Act Matters\nDefinition of Waters of the United States\u201d Under the CWA: On August 28, 2015, the EPA's and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' final rule defining the phrase \"waters of the United States\" under the CWA became effective. Idaho Power believes that the final rule potentially expands federal jurisdiction under the CWA beyond traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, territorial seas, tributaries, and adjacent wetlands, to a number of other waters, including waters with a \"significant nexus\" to those traditional waters. As a result of the potential expansion, the final rule may result in additional permitting and regulatory requirements under multiple provisions of the CWA. Idaho Power has analyzed the final rule and expects that while it may incur additional permitting and other costs associated with the rule, the aggregate amount of increased costs is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition, in part due to the relatively arid climate of Idaho Power's service area and the existing application of the CWA to most of Idaho Power's facilities, including its hydroelectric plants.\nIn October 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay of the final waters of the United States rule from becoming effective. In response to the Sixth Circuit's decision, the EPA resumed nationwide use of the agency's prior regulations defining the term waters of the United States.\u201d The EPA stated that those regulations will be implemented as they were prior to August 27, 2015, by applying relevant case law, applicable policy, and the best science and technical data on a case-by-case basis in determining which waters are protected by the CWA.\nCWA Matters Related to Hydroelectric Relicensing: Idaho Power is also addressing CWA issues associated with the relicensing of its HCC. See Relicensing of Hydroelectric Projects\u201d in this MD&A for additional information on the impact of the CWA on that relicensing effort.\nReview of Federal Coal Leases\nIn January 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced that it would launch a comprehensive review to identify and evaluate potential reforms to the federal coal lease program. The review is intended to address questions such as how, when, and where to lease coal resources, how to account for the environmental and public health impacts of federal coal production, and how to ensure taxpayers are earning a fair return for the use of the coal resources. The U.S. Department of the Interior stated that it will not issue new coal leases during the pendency of the review, except under limited circumstances, but mining under existing leases will not be suspended during the review. BCC, which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant, currently leases its coal under federal, state, and private coal leases. It is uncertain how new federal lease applications will be handled during the U.S. Department of the Interior's coal lease review. Idaho Power believes that BCC has adequate reserves under existing leases to satisfy its coal delivery obligations to the Jim Bridger plant during the term of the existing coal supply contract through 2024, and that the Jim Bridger plant will otherwise have access to sufficient coal supplies for its operation for the foreseeable future. However, depending on the outcome of the Department of the Interior's review, the availability of coal resources could decline and the cost of leases for coal resources could increase, which could increase the fuel cost for each of Idaho Power's co-owned coal-fired plants.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWhen preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's management must apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates often involve judgment about factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management's control. Management adjusts these estimates based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual amounts could materially differ from the estimates. Management believes the accounting policies and estimates discussed below are the most critical to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.\nAccounting for Rate Regulation\nEntities that meet specific conditions are required by GAAP to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized. Similarly, certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities. Idaho Power must satisfy three conditions to apply regulatory accounting: (1) an independent regulator must set rates; (2) the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service; and (3) the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator.\nIdaho Power has determined that it meets these conditions, and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate-making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating Idaho Power. The primary effect of this policy is that Idaho Power had recorded $1.5 billion of regulatory assets and $447 million of regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2016. Idaho Power expects to recover these regulatory assets from customers through rates and refund these regulatory liabilities to customers through rates, but recovery or refund is subject to final review by the regulatory bodies. If future recovery or refund of these amounts ceases to be probable, or if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate those regulatory assets or liabilities. Either circumstance could have a material effect on Idaho Power's financial condition or results of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nIDACORP and Idaho Power use judgment and estimation in developing the provision for income taxes and the reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws can involve uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret such laws differently. Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts and may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income, cash flows, and tax-related assets and liabilities.\nIdaho Power provides deferred income taxes related to its plant assets for the difference between income tax depreciation and book depreciation used for financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes for other items are provided for the temporary differences between the income tax and financial accounting treatment of such items. Unless contrary to applicable income tax guidance, deferred income taxes are not provided for those income tax temporary differences where the prescribed regulatory accounting methods, or flow-through, direct Idaho Power to recognize the tax impacts currently for rate making and financial reporting.\nRefer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 2 - Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to income taxes.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nIdaho Power maintains a tax-qualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors called the Security Plan for Senior Management Employees (SMSP), and a postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits).\nThe costs IDACORP and Idaho Power record for these plans depend on the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, actual returns on plan assets, and several assumptions used in the actuarial valuations from which the expense is derived. The key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future stock market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors used to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates.\nThe assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high-quality corporate debt. Specifically, IDACORP and Idaho Power determined the discount rate for each plan through the construction of hypothetical portfolios of bonds selected from high-quality corporate bonds available as of December 31, 2016, with maturities matching the projected cash outflows of the plans. Based on the results of this analysis, the discount rate used to calculate the 2017 pension expense will be decreased to 4.45 percent from the 4.60 percent used in 2016.\nRate-of-return projections for plan assets are based on historical risk/return relationships among asset classes. The primary measure is the historical risk premium each asset class has delivered versus the yield on the Moody's AA Corporate Bond Index. This historical risk premium is then added to the current yield on the Moody's AA Corporate Bond Index, and Idaho\nPower believes the result provides a reasonable prediction of future investment performance. Additional analysis is performed to measure the expected range of returns, as well as worst-case and best-case scenarios. Based on the current interest rate environment, current rate-of-return expectations are lower than the nominal returns generated over the past 20 years when interest rates were generally much higher. The long-term rate of return used to calculate the 2017 pension expense will be 7.5 percent, the same assumption as was used for 2016.\nGross net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost for these plans totaled $52 million, $51 million, and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, including amounts deferred as regulatory assets (see discussion below) and amounts allocated to capitalized labor. For 2017, gross pension and other postretirement benefit costs are expected to total approximately $51 million, which takes into account the change in the discount rate noted above.\nHad different actuarial assumptions been used, pension expense could have varied significantly. The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in the discount rate and rate-of-return on plan assets actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension and postretirement expense:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate of return\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 0.5% rate increase on net periodic benefit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 0.5% rate decrease on net periodic benefit cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, a 0.5 percent increase in the plans' discount rates would have resulted in a $74 million decrease in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of December 31, 2016. A 0.5 percent decrease in the plans' discount rates would have resulted in an $83 million increase in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of December 31, 2016.\nThe IPUC has authorized Idaho Power to account for its defined benefit pension plan expense on a cash basis, and to defer and account for accrued pension expense as a regulatory asset. The IPUC acknowledged that it is appropriate for Idaho Power to seek recovery in its revenue requirement of reasonable and prudently incurred pension expense based on actual cash contributions. In 2007, Idaho Power began deferring pension expense to a regulatory asset account to be matched with revenue when future pension contributions are recovered through rates. At December 31, 2016, a total of $105 million of expense was deferred as a regulatory asset. Approximately $23 million is expected to be deferred in 2017. Idaho Power recorded pension expense in 2016, 2015, and 2014 of $19 million, $19 million, and $35 million, respectively.\nRefer to Note 11 - Benefit Plans\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nContingent Liabilities\nAn estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if (a) it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no accrual is recorded but disclosure of the contingency, if material, in the notes to the financial statements is required. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized. IDACORP and Idaho Power have a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory and legal matters. If the recognition criteria have been met, liabilities have been recorded. Estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the financial statements.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a listing of new and recently adopted accounting standards, see Note 1 - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in this report, the general financial condition and results of operations for IDACORP and its subsidiaries and Idaho Power and its subsidiary are discussed. While reading the MD&A, please refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of IDACORP and Idaho Power. Also refer to \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and Part I - Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" in this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this MD&A and elsewhere in this report.\nINTRODUCTION\nIDACORP is a holding company formed in 1998 whose principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power. IDACORP's common stock is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol IDA\u201d. Idaho Power is an electric utility whose rates and other matters are regulated by the IPUC, OPUC, and FERC. Idaho Power generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to customers in its Idaho and Oregon service territories, as well as from the wholesale sale and transmission of electricity. Idaho Power experiences its highest retail energy sales during the summer irrigation and cooling season, with a lower peak in the winter that generally results from heating demand. Idaho Power's rates are established through regulatory proceedings that affect its ability to recover its costs and the potential to earn a return on its investment.\nIdaho Power is the parent of IERCo, a joint venturer in BCC, which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger generating plant owned in part by Idaho Power. IDACORP's other subsidiaries include IFS, an investor in affordable housing and other real estate investments; Ida-West Energy Company, an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the PURPA; and IDACORP Energy Services Co. (IESCo), which is the former limited partner of, and successor by merger to, IDACORP Energy L.P., a marketer of energy commodities that wound down operations in 2003.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nManagement's Outlook\nCustomer growth in Idaho Power's service area continues to benefit Idaho Power's revenues. To encourage continued responsible and sustainable growth, and as part of its planning for the future, Idaho Power actively participates in and supports state and local economic development initiatives. At the same time that Idaho Power pursues customer growth, it must also plan for that growth. Idaho Power plans for infrastructure that will support anticipated growth and allow it to continue to provide reliable, fair-priced electric power to its customers. To that end, Idaho Power's noteworthy capital projects include the replacement of aging assets, upgrades to generation plants, a multi-year plan for replacement of underground conductor, ongoing system upgrades, and continued permitting of the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West 500-kV transmission lines. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates total capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion over the next five years.\nIdaho Power operates within what it believes to be a constructive regulatory framework, achieved through general rate cases, subject-specific rate filings, tariff riders, and cost recovery mechanisms that share risks and benefits with Idaho Power's customers. To complement the regulatory framework, Idaho Power focuses on controlling power supply, operating, maintenance, and capital costs through process review and improvement initiatives, and by empowering employees to identify new means to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, and enhance individual and enterprise performance for the benefit of IDACORP's shareholders, Idaho Power's customers, and other stakeholders. Idaho Power's base rates were most recently reset in 2012 through general rate cases in Idaho and Oregon. During 2017, Idaho Power will continue to assess the need to file a general rate case to reset base rates in the coming years in Idaho or Oregon.\nSeparately, during 2016, IDACORP continued to make meaningful progress toward its target dividend payout ratio of between 50 and 60 percent of sustainable IDACORP earnings, which expanded on the progress made in previous years. From 2012 through 2016, IDACORP's board of directors approved a collective 83 percent increase in the quarterly dividend, from $0.30 to $0.55 per share.\n2016 Accomplishments and 2017 Initiatives\nIDACORP's business strategy emphasizes Idaho Power as IDACORP's core business. For the past several years, Idaho Power has been executing its three-part strategy of responsible planning, responsible development and protection of resources, and responsible energy use. This strategy is described in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business\" of this report. Examples of IDACORP's and Idaho Power's achievements and recognitions during 2016 under its three-part business strategy include:\n \u2022 IDACORP achieved net income growth for a ninth consecutive year; \n \u2022 IDACORP provided a 19 percent cumulative total shareholder return over the past three years, including share price appreciation and dividends paid, ranking in the 88th percentile among peers; \n \u2022 increased IDACORP's quarterly common stock dividend from $0.51 per share to $0.55 per share; \n \u2022 produced the best year of performance for Idaho Power's electric system reliability since formal measurement began in 2006; \n \u2022 executed on business optimization initiatives, focusing on improving operations and controlling expenditures; \n \u2022 made continued progress toward the permitting of the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West 500-kV transmission projects; \n \u2022 achieved Idaho Power's CO2 emissions intensity reduction goal; \n \u2022 earned the highest rolling 12-month customer relationship index score (Idaho Power's internal measure of customer satisfaction) ever recorded by the company; and \n \u2022 Idaho Power tied for 5th place in the annual \"Best Energy Companies\" rankings published by Public Utilities Fortnightly. \nFor 2017, IDACORP and Idaho Power have established a number of organizational initiatives, including the following:\n \u2022 continue to execute on the three core focuses for 2017-improving Idaho Power's core business, growing revenues, and enhancing the brand and positioning the company for the future; \n \u2022 continue to enhance and promote Idaho Power's safety culture; \n \u2022 grow financial strength by supporting business development in Idaho Power's service area while actively managing costs; \n \u2022 continue upward progress within IDACORP's target dividend payout ratio range; \n \u2022 pursue responsible investments that address customer growth while improving reliability, enhancing Idaho Power customers' experience, increasing shareholder value, and managing carbon impacts; and \n \u2022 integrate new renewable generation resources into Idaho Power's grid and continue progress toward participation in the Western EIM, anticipated to begin in the spring of 2018, which is expected to capture intra-hour market opportunities to help achieve greater reliability and improve system dispatch. \nOverview of General Factors and Trends Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition are affected by a number of factors, and the impact of those factors is discussed in more detail later in this MD&A. To provide context for the discussion elsewhere in this report, some of the more notable factors include the following:\n \u2022 Regulation of Rates and Cost Recovery: The price that Idaho Power is authorized to charge for its electric and transmission service is a critical factor in determining IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. Those rates are established by state regulatory commissions and the FERC, and are intended to allow Idaho Power an opportunity to recover its expenses and earn a reasonable return on investment. Because of the significant impact of ratemaking decisions, and in pursuit of its goal of advancing a purposeful regulatory strategy, Idaho Power focuses on timely recovery of its costs through filings with the company's regulators, working to put in place innovative regulatory mechanisms, and on the prudent management of expenses and investments. Idaho Power has a regulatory settlement stipulation in Idaho that includes provisions for the accelerated amortization of certain tax credits to help achieve a minimum 9.5 percent return on year-end equity in the Idaho jurisdiction (Idaho ROE). During 2017, Idaho Power will continue to assess the need to file a general rate case to reset base rates. \n \u2022 Economic Conditions and Loads: Economic conditions impact consumer demand for electricity and revenues, collectability of accounts, the volume of off-system sales, and the need to construct and improve infrastructure, purchase power, and implement programs to meet customer load demands. In recent years, Idaho Power has seen growth in the number of customers in its service area-in 2016, its customer count grew by 1.8 percent-and in employment in Idaho Power's service area, which grew by approximately 3.5 percent in 2016 based on Idaho Department of Labor preliminary December 2016 data. Idaho Power expects its number of customers to continue to \nincrease in the foreseeable future. Idaho Power has in recent years supported State of Idaho-coordinated efforts to promote economic development with an emphasis on attracting industrial and commercial customers to its service area.\nIn August 2016, Idaho Power began preparing its 2017 IRP, Idaho Power's long-term forecast of loads and resources. The load forecast assumptions Idaho Power expects to use in the 2017 IRP are included in the table below. For comparison purposes, the analogous average annual growth rates used in the prior two IRPs are included.\n\n \u2022 Rate Base Growth and Infrastructure Investment: As noted above, the rates established by the IPUC and OPUC are determined so as to provide an opportunity for Idaho Power to recover authorized operating expenses and earn a reasonable return on rate base.\u201d Rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost (net of accumulated depreciation) of utility plant in service, subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items. Over time, rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write-offs as authorized by the IPUC and OPUC. In recent years, Idaho Power has been pursuing significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure, including major ongoing transmission projects such as the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West projects, in an effort to ensure an adequate supply of electricity, to provide service to new customers, and to maintain system reliability. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and component replacement, and the company is undertaking a significant relicensing effort for the Hells Canyon Complex (HCC), its largest hydroelectric generation resource. Idaho Power expects to include completed capital projects in its next general rate case or, in circumstances where appropriate, a single-issue rate case for individual projects with a significant capital cost. Depending on the outcome of the regulatory process and items such as the rate of return authorized by the IPUC and OPUC, this growth in rate base has the potential to increase Idaho Power's revenues and earnings. \n \u2022 Weather Conditions: Weather and agricultural growing conditions have a significant impact on Idaho Power's energy sales. Relatively low and high temperatures result in greater energy use for heating and cooling, respectively. During the agricultural growing season, which in large part occurs during the second and third quarters, irrigation customers use electricity to operate irrigation pumps, and weather conditions can impact the timing and extent of use of those pumps. Idaho Power also has tiered rates and seasonal rates, which contribute to increased revenues during higher-load periods, most notably during the third quarter of each year when overall customer demand is highest. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of weather on sales of energy to residential and small commercial customers is mitigated through the Idaho FCA mechanism. \nFurther, as Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities comprise nearly one-half of Idaho Power's nameplate generation capacity, precipitation levels impact the mix of Idaho Power's generation resources. When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must rely on more expensive generation sources and purchased power. When favorable hydroelectric generating conditions exist for Idaho Power, they also may exist for other Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facility operators, lowering regional wholesale market prices and impacting the revenue Idaho Power receives from off-system sales of its excess power. Much of the adverse or favorable impact of this volatility is addressed through the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms.\n \u2022 Mitigation of Impact of Fuel and Purchased Power Expense: In addition to hydroelectric generation, Idaho Power relies significantly on coal and natural gas to fuel its generation facilities and power purchases in the wholesale markets. Fuel costs are impacted by electricity sales volumes, the terms of contracts for fuel, Idaho Power's generation capacity, the availability of hydroelectric generation resources, transmission capacity, energy market prices, and Idaho Power's hedging program for managing fuel costs. Recently, low natural gas prices have made operation of Idaho Power's natural gas power plants more economical, resulting in increased operation of those plants and decreased operation of coal-fired plants. Purchased power costs are impacted by the terms of contracts for purchased power, the rate of expansion of alternative energy generation sources such as wind or solar energy, and wholesale energy market \nprices. The Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms mitigate in large part the potential adverse impacts of fluctuations in power supply costs to Idaho Power.\n \u2022 Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional elections: The recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation, and government policy. While it is uncertain whether and when any such changes will occur, they could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's businesses and the electric utility industry. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals discussed during and after the election that could have a material impact on IDACORP and Idaho Power include, but are not limited to, reform of the federal tax code; infrastructure renewal programs; and modifications to public company reporting requirements and environmental regulation. \n \u2022 Regulatory and Environmental Compliance Costs: Idaho Power is subject to extensive federal and state laws, policies, and regulations, as well as regulatory actions and audits by agencies and quasi-governmental agencies, including the FERC and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Compliance with these requirements directly influences Idaho Power's operating environment and affects Idaho Power's operating costs. Environmental laws and regulations, in particular, may increase the cost of operating generation plants and constructing new facilities, require that Idaho Power install additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants, or require that Idaho Power cease operating certain generation plants. For instance, the Boardman coal-fired power plant, in which Idaho Power owns a 10-percent interest, is scheduled to cease coal-fired operations by the end of 2020, a decision driven in large part by the substantial cost of environmental controls required by existing regulations. Similarly, Idaho Power is assessing the early closure of the North Valmy coal-fired power plant, of which Idaho Power owns a 50-percent interest, and in October and November 2016 filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC, respectively, requesting accelerated depreciation of the facility. Idaho Power expects to spend a considerable amount on environmental compliance and controls in the next decade. \n \u2022 Water Management and Relicensing of the Hells Canyon Hydroelectric Project: Because of Idaho Power's reliance on stream flow in the Snake River and its tributaries, Idaho Power participates in numerous proceedings and venues that may affect its water rights, seeking to preserve the long-term availability of its rights for its hydroelectric projects. Also, Idaho Power is involved in renewing its long-term federal license for the HCC, its largest hydroelectric generation source. Given the number of parties and issues involved, Idaho Power's relicensing costs have been and will continue to be substantial. Idaho Power cannot currently determine the terms of, and costs associated with, any resulting long-term license. \nSummary of 2016 Financial Results\nThe following is a summary of Idaho Power's net income, net income attributable to IDACORP, and IDACORP's earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 (in thousands, except earnings per share amounts):\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to IDACORP, Inc. for year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015 (items are in millions and are before tax unless otherwise noted):\n\nIDACORP's 2016 net income increased $3.6 million compared with 2015. While Idaho Power's 2016 net income was relatively flat, decreasing $1.7 million compared with 2015, net income from other subsidiaries increased IDACORP's net income by $5.3 million.\nContinued customer growth at Idaho Power increased operating income by $11.2 million, which was more than offset by a $14.7 million decrease from lower usage per customer in 2016 compared with 2015. Winter temperatures in 2016 were slightly colder than 2015, but milder summer temperatures in 2016 led to lower sales volumes, revenues, and operating income. Other operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses were $9.7 million higher in 2016 compared with 2015, largely related to higher variable labor-related costs.\nDuring 2015, Idaho Power recorded a total of $3.2 million as a provision against current revenue related to the October 2014 Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation that required sharing with Idaho customers of a portion of 2015 earnings that exceeded 10.0 percent. During 2016, no such sharing provision was recorded as Idaho Power's Idaho ROE did not exceed 10.0 percent. At December 31, 2016, the full $45 million of additional ADITC remains available for future use under the terms of the October 2014 Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation.\nIdaho Power's income tax expense was lower in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to greater net flow-through income tax benefits, additional share-based compensation tax benefits related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, and lower pretax income. These decreases were partially offset by a smaller flow-through benefit of a tax deductible make-whole premium that Idaho Power paid in connection with the early redemption of long-term debt in 2016 compared with the flow-through benefit of an early bond redemption in 2015.\nIDACORP's 2016 net income also included a $3.7 million increase, net of tax, in IESCo's earnings, a result of a December 2016 settlement relating to the California energy market proceedings. Refer to Note 10 - Contingencies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the settlement. IDACORP also benefited from distributions related to fully-amortized affordable housing investments at IFS, which reduced IDACORP's income tax expense.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section of the MD&A takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected IDACORP's and Idaho Power's earnings. In this analysis, the results for 2016 are compared with 2015 and the results for 2015 are compared with 2014.\nUtility Operations\nThe table below presents Idaho Power's energy sales and supply (in thousands of MWh) for the last three years.\n\nSales Volume and Generation: In 2016, general business sales volumes decreased less than 1 percent compared with the prior year. Winter temperatures in 2016 were slightly colder than 2015, but milder summer temperatures in 2016 led to lower sales volumes. Also, a shorter irrigation season due to a later start in 2016 compared with 2015 resulted in lower usage per irrigation customer than during 2015.\nOff-system sales volumes decreased 68 thousand MWh, or 5 percent, during 2016 compared with 2015. Low wholesale market prices reduced economic benefits of operating Idaho Power's non-hydroelectric generation facilities for off-system sales.\nFavorable hydroelectric generating conditions from greater snowpack in the spring of 2016 compared with the spring of 2015 led to increased hydroelectric generation in 2016. Coal-fired generation decreased in 2016 compared with 2015 as low wholesale market prices led to an increase in purchased power.\nThe financial impacts of fluctuations in off-system sales, purchased power, fuel expense, and other power supply-related expenses are addressed in Idaho Power's Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms, which are described later in this MD&A.\nGeneral Business Revenues: The table below presents Idaho Power's general business revenues (in thousands), MWh sales (in thousands), and number of customers for the last three years.\n\n(1) Idaho Power is collecting approximately $10.7 million annually in the Idaho jurisdiction for AFUDC on HCC construction work in progress, but is deferring revenue recognition of the amounts collected until the license is issued and the accumulated license costs are placed in service.\nChanges in rates, changes in customer demand, and changes in FCA revenues are typically the primary causes of fluctuations in general business revenue from period to period. See \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for a list of rate changes implemented over the last three years. The primary influences on changes in customer demand for electricity are weather, economic conditions, and energy efficiency. Extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating, while moderate temperatures decrease sales. Precipitation levels and the timing of precipitation during the agricultural growing season also affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps. Boise, Idaho, weather-related information for the last three years is presented in the following table.\n\n(1) Heating and cooling degree-days are common measures used in the utility industry to analyze the demand for electricity and indicate when a customer would use electricity for heating and air conditioning. A degree-day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from 65 degrees. Each degree of temperature above 65 degrees is counted as one cooling degree-day, and each degree of temperature below 65 degrees is counted as one heating degree-day. While Boise, Idaho weather conditions are not necessarily representative of weather conditions throughout Idaho Power's service area, the greater Boise area has the majority of Idaho Power's customers.\n(2) Normal heating degree-days and cooling degree-days elements are, by convention, the arithmetic mean of the elements computed over 30 consecutive years. The annual normal amounts are the sum of the 12 monthly normal amounts. These normal amounts are computed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nIdaho Power's rate structure provides for higher rates during the summer when system loads are at their highest, and includes tiers such that rates increase as a customer's consumption level increases. These seasonal and tiered rate structures contribute to seasonal fluctuations in revenues and earnings.\nGeneral Business Revenues - 2016 Compared with 2015: General business revenue decreased $5.0 million in 2016 compared with 2015. The factors affecting general business revenues included the following:\n \u2022 Rates: Rate changes decreased general business revenue by $3.9 million for 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the recovery of power cost adjustment amounts in 2016. The recovery of power cost adjustment amounts in rates has no effect on operating income as it is amortized into expense in the same period it is recovered through rates. \n \u2022 Customers: Customer growth of 1.8 percent increased general business revenue by $15.6 million in 2016 compared with 2015. \n \u2022 Usage: Lower usage (on a per customer basis), primarily by irrigation, commercial, and residential customers, decreased general business revenue by $21.3 million in 2016 compared with 2015. Winter temperatures in 2016 were slightly colder than 2015, but milder summer temperatures in 2016 compared with 2015 led to lower sales volumes. Also, a shorter irrigation season due to a later start in 2016 compared with 2015 resulted in lower usage per irrigation customer in 2016 than during 2015. Greater customer participation in energy efficiency programs also contributed to lower usage during 2016 compared with 2015. \n \u2022 Sharing: Idaho Power's sharing mechanism is associated with an Idaho regulatory settlement agreement that provides for the sharing with customers of a portion of Idaho-jurisdiction earnings exceeding a 10.0 percent Idaho ROE. The impact of this mechanism is partially recorded as a reduction to general business revenue. During 2015, Idaho Power recorded a total of $3.2 million as a provision against current revenue related to the sharing mechanism. In 2016, no such sharing provision was recorded as Idaho Power's Idaho ROE did not exceed 10.0 percent. \n \u2022 Idaho FCA Revenue: Partially offsetting lower usage per customer, the Idaho FCA mechanism increased revenues by $1.4 million in 2016 compared with 2015. Idaho Power accrued $30.3 million of Idaho FCA revenues in 2016, compared with $28.9 million in 2015. \nGeneral Business Revenues - 2015 Compared with 2014: General business revenue increased $28.8 million in 2015 compared with 2014. The factors affecting general business revenues included the following:\n \u2022 Rates: Two rate changes impacted general business revenue-an Idaho PCA rate increase effective June 1, 2014, and Idaho PCA rate decrease effective June 1, 2015, both described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Overall, rate changes combined to decrease general business revenue by $2.2 million in 2015. \n \u2022 Customers: Customer growth of 1.8 percent increased general business revenue by $14.1 million. \n \u2022 Usage: Lower usage per customer in 2015, primarily driven by the impact of more moderate winter weather on residential customer usage, as well as energy efficiency, decreased general business revenue by $0.7 million. Residential usage per customer was 1.4 percent lower in 2015. \n \u2022 Sharing: Revenue sharing of $3.2 million and $8.0 million were recorded in 2015 and 2014, respectively. This sharing resulted in a net increase to general business revenue of $4.8 million in 2015 compared with 2014. \n \u2022 Idaho FCA Revenue: FCA mechanism revenues increased $12.7 million compared with 2014, including the impacts of weather and of modifications made to the mechanism by the IPUC effective January 1, 2015. Idaho Power accrued $28.9 million of Idaho FCA revenues in 2015, compared with $16.2 million in 2014. The modifications to the FCA mechanism are described in more detail in \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A and in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. \nOff-System Sales: Off-system sales consist primarily of opportunity sales of surplus system energy. The following table presents Idaho Power's off-system sales for the last three years (in thousands, except for MWh amounts):\n\nOff-System Sales - 2016 Compared with 2015: Off-system sales revenue decreased by $5.7 million, or 18 percent. Off-system sales volumes decreased 5 percent in 2016 compared with the same periods in 2015 as low wholesale market prices reduced the economic benefits of operating Idaho Power's non-hydroelectric generation facilities for off-system sales. The average price of off-system sales for 2016 was 14 percent lower compared with 2015.\nOff-System Sales - 2015 Compared with 2014: Off-system sales revenue decreased by $46.3 million, or 60 percent, in 2015. Off-system sales volumes decreased 44 percent, as 2014 sales benefited from more favorable market conditions, at times, for selling power off-system. The average price of off-system sales transactions in 2015 was 29 percent lower than 2014, indicative of generally lower market prices in 2015. Decreases in output from hydroelectric resources and an increase in overall load due to customer growth also reduced the amount of surplus power available for sale off-system during 2015.\nOther Revenues: The table below presents the components of other revenues for the last three years (in thousands):\n\nOther Revenues - 2016 Compared with 2015: Other revenues increased $2.6 million, or 3 percent, in 2016 compared with 2015. Greater customer participation in energy efficiency programs increased revenue and corresponding expense in 2016 compared with 2015. Most energy efficiency activities are funded through a rider mechanism on customer bills. Energy efficiency program expenditures funded through the rider are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount of revenues recorded in other revenues, resulting in no net impact on earnings. The cumulative variance between expenditures and amounts collected through the rider is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability pending future collection from, or obligation to, customers. A liability balance indicates that Idaho Power has collected more than it has spent and an asset balance indicates that Idaho Power has spent more than it has collected. At December 31, 2016, Idaho Power's energy efficiency rider balances were a $5.6 million regulatory asset in the Oregon jurisdiction and a $10.7 million regulatory liability in the Idaho jurisdiction.\nOther Revenues - 2015 Compared with 2014: Other revenues increased $6.4 million, or 8 percent, in 2015. The increases in 2015 were primarily the result of increased electricity transmission (wheeling) volumes and greater customer participation in energy efficiency programs.\nPurchased Power: The table below presents Idaho Power's purchased power expenses and volumes for the last three years (in thousands, except for MWh amounts):\n\nIdaho Power is required by federal law to purchase power from some PURPA generation projects at a specified price regardless of the then-current load demand or wholesale energy market prices. The intermittent, non-dispatchable nature of the PURPA generation increases the likelihood that Idaho Power will at times be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources and may be required to sell its excess power in the wholesale power market at a significant loss. The other purchased power cost per MWh often exceeds the off-system sales revenue per MWh because Idaho Power generally needs to purchase more power during heavy load periods than during light load periods, and conversely has less energy available for off-system sales during heavy load periods than light load periods. Market energy prices are typically higher during heavy load periods than during light load periods. Also, in accordance with Idaho Power's risk management policy, Idaho Power may purchase or sell energy several months in advance of anticipated delivery. The regional energy market price is dynamic and additional energy purchase or sale transactions that Idaho Power makes at current market prices may be noticeably different than the advance purchase or sale transaction prices. Most of the non-PURPA purchased power and substantially all of the PURPA power purchase costs are recovered through base rates and Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nPurchased Power - 2016 Compared with 2015: Purchased power expense increased $19.3 million, or 9 percent, in 2016. The increase was due primarily to increased volumes purchased from both PURPA and non-PURPA sources attributable largely to lower market prices at times that encouraged market purchases rather than operating some generating units. Volume increases were partially offset by lower non-PURPA wholesale market prices.\nPurchased Power - 2015 Compared with 2014: Purchased power expense decreased $18.2 million, or 7 percent, in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to reduced volumes purchased from both PURPA and non-PURPA sources. Volume decreases were partially offset by increases in average prices of both PURPA and non-PURPA sources.\nFuel Expense: The table below presents Idaho Power's fuel expenses and thermal generation for the last three years (in thousands, except per MWh amounts):\n\n(1) 2015 excludes 147 MWh of generation from the Jim Bridger power plant for which costs were capitalized during feasibility testing of capital projects under contemplation.\n(2)Includes a negligible amount of expense and generation related to the Salmon diesel-fired generation plant.\nThe majority of the fuel for Idaho Power's jointly-owned coal-fired plants is purchased through long-term contracts, including purchases from BCC, a one-third owned joint venture of IERCo. The price of coal from BCC is subject to fluctuations in mine operating expenses, geologic conditions, and production levels. BCC supplies up to two-thirds of the coal used by the Jim Bridger plant. Natural gas is mainly purchased on the regional wholesale spot market at published index prices. In addition to commodity (variable) costs, both natural gas and coal expense include costs that are more fixed in nature for items such as capacity charges, transportation, and fuel handling. Period to period variances in fuel expense per MWh are noticeably impacted by these fixed charges when generation output is substantially different between the periods.\nFuel Expense - 2016 Compared with 2015: In 2016, fuel expense decreased $6.7 million, or 4 percent, compared with 2015, due principally to decreased output from coal-fired plants and natural gas plants during 2016. Overall generation decreased 15 percent due to a change in resource mix resulting from increased purchase requirements from cogeneration and small power production (CSPP) projects, resource constraints at various generating locations, including Langley and Bridger, due to scheduled maintenance and other factors, and more open market purchases for economic reasons. The volume decreases were partially offset by higher coal prices due to higher mining costs at BCC. The higher mining costs resulted in part due to issues with underground mining equipment that is no longer in service.\nFuel Expense - 2015 Compared with 2014: In 2015, fuel expense decreased $15.0 million, or 7 percent, compared with 2014, due principally to decreased output from coal-fired plants during 2015 combined with lower regional natural gas prices for fuel used at the natural gas plants. Overall generation decreased 4 percent due to lower system loads and lower wholesale energy prices. The expense per MWh for natural gas decreased approximately 30 percent in 2015 compared with 2014. These lower natural gas prices led to a shift of generation from coal-fired plants to natural gas plants.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms: Idaho Power's power supply costs (primarily purchased power and fuel expense, less off-system sales) can vary significantly from year to year. Volatility of power supply costs arises from factors such as weather conditions, wholesale market prices, volumes of power purchased and sold in the wholesale markets, Idaho Power's hydroelectric and thermal generation volumes and fuel costs, generation plant availability, and retail loads. To address the volatility of power supply costs, Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in the Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions allow Idaho Power to recover from, or refund to, customers most of the fluctuations in power supply costs. In the Idaho jurisdiction, the PCA includes a cost or benefit sharing ratio that allocates the deviations in net power supply expenses between customers (95 percent) and Idaho Power (5 percent), with the exception of PURPA power purchases and demand response program incentives, which are allocated 100 percent to customers. The Idaho deferral period, or PCA year, runs from April 1 through March 31. Amounts deferred during the PCA year are primarily recovered or refunded during the subsequent June 1 through May 31 period. Because of the power cost adjustment mechanisms, the primary financial impacts of power supply cost variations is that cash is paid out but recovery from customers does not occur until a future period, or cash that is collected is refunded to customers in a future period, resulting in fluctuations in operating cash flows from year to year.\nThe table that follows presents the components of the Idaho and Oregon power cost adjustment mechanisms for the last three years (in thousands).\n\nThe power supply accruals (deferrals) represent the portion of the power supply cost fluctuations accrued (deferred) under the power cost adjustment mechanisms. When actual power supply costs are higher than the amount forecasted in power cost adjustment rates, which was the case for all periods presented, most of the difference is deferred. The amortization of the prior year's balances represents the offset to the amounts being collected or refunded in the current PCA year that were deferred or accrued in the prior PCA year (the true-up component of the PCA).\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2016 Compared with 2015: Actual net power supply cost deferrals increased in 2016 relative to 2015, a change of $8.0 million-from $35.8 million to $43.8 million. The increase in the deferral is due in part to higher fuel costs related to coal and purchased power with less surplus sales than forecasted. The $38.5 million of amortization offsets the collection from customers of prior years' deferrals and was lower in 2016 as Idaho Power is amortizing a smaller deferral balance in the current year than the prior year.\nPower Cost Adjustment Mechanisms - 2015 Compared with 2014: Actual net power supply cost deferrals decreased in 2015 relative to 2014, a change of $12.3 million-from $48.1 million to $35.8 million. Power supply costs collected through base rates increased on June 1, 2015, resulting in less costs needing to be recovered through the power cost adjustment mechanisms since that time. The $52.6 million million of amortization offsets the collection from customers of prior years' deferrals.\nOther Operations and Maintenance Expenses: The changes in other O&M expenses for the periods presented are discussed below.\nO&M - 2016 Compared with 2015: Other O&M expense increased by $9.7 million in 2016 compared with 2015, an increase of 3 percent, due primarily to the following factors:\n \u2022 labor-related expenses increased $6.5 million, or 3 percent, in 2016 due to normal escalations in labor and benefits costs and higher variable employee costs; \n \u2022 scheduled maintenance at the Langley Gulch natural gas-fired generation plant increased O&M expenses $1.6 million; and \n \u2022 a $1.1 million increase primarily related to transmission agreements entered into in October 2015, which also resulted in a corresponding increase in other revenue. \nO&M - 2015 Compared with 2014: Other O&M expense decreased by $12.4 million in 2015 compared with 2014, a decrease of 3.5 percent, due to the following factors:\n \u2022 $16.7 million was recorded as additional pension expense in 2014 related to a December 2011 Idaho regulatory settlement agreement, which required sharing with Idaho customers of a portion of earnings in excess of a 10.0 percent Idaho ROE (thereby reducing customers' future pension obligations). There were no additional expenses related to the settlement agreement in 2015; \n \u2022 excluding the additional 2014 pension expense, labor-related expenses increased $2.1 million, or 1.1 percent, in 2015 due to normal escalations in labor and benefits costs; and \n \u2022 hydroelectric generation expenses increased $2.0 million, primarily due to increased repair costs and purchased services. \nIncome Taxes\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's 2016 income tax expense decreased $9.3 million and $11.0 million, respectively, when compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily due to greater net flow-through income tax benefits at Idaho Power, a tax benefit from the adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation, distributions related to fully-amortized affordable housing investments at IDACORP, and lower Idaho Power pre-tax earnings in 2016.\nIncome tax expense in 2015 increased significantly compared with 2014, principally as a result of a 2014 flow-through tax benefit related to the cumulative impact of tax accounting method changes for Idaho Power's capitalized repairs deduction that did not recur in 2015. For additional information relating to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes, including the availability of tax credit carryforwards, see Note 2 - Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nIdaho Power continues to pursue significant enhancements to its utility infrastructure in an effort to ensure an adequate supply of electricity, to provide service to new customers, and to maintain system reliability. Idaho Power's existing hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities also require continuing upgrades and component replacement. Idaho Power's expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, excluding AFUDC, were $287 million in 2016, $284 million in 2015, and $265 million in 2014. Idaho Power expects these substantial capital expenditures to continue, with estimated total capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion expected over the period from 2017 through 2021.\nIdaho Power funds its liquidity needs for capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. As of February 17, 2017, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's access to debt, equity, and credit arrangements included:\n \u2022 their respective $100 million and $300 million revolving credit facilities; \n \u2022 IDACORP's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of debt securities and common stock; \n \u2022 Idaho Power's shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016, which may be used for the issuance of first mortgage bonds and debt securities; $500 million is available for issuance pursuant to state regulatory authority; and \n \u2022 IDACORP's and Idaho Power's issuance of commercial paper, which may be issued up to an amount equal to the available credit capacity under their respective credit facilities. \nBased on planned capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses for 2017, the companies believe they will be able to meet capital requirements and fund corporate expenses during 2017 with a combination of existing cash and operating cash flows generated by Idaho Power's utility business, together with proceeds from either draws on credit facilities or Idaho Power's issuance of debt securities. IDACORP and Idaho Power believe they could meet any short-term cash shortfall with existing credit facilities and expect to continue to manage short-term liquidity through commercial paper markets.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power monitor capital markets with a view toward opportunistic debt and equity transactions, taking into account current and potential future long-term needs. As a result, IDACORP may issue debt securities or common stock, and Idaho Power may issue debt securities, if the companies believe terms available in the capital markets are favorable and that issuances would be financially prudent. Idaho Power also periodically analyzes whether partial or full early redemption of one or more existing outstanding series of first mortgage bonds is desirable, and in some cases may refinance indebtedness with new indebtedness issued with more favorable terms. To that end, on March 10, 2016, Idaho Power issued $120 million in principal amount of 4.05% first mortgage bonds, Series J, maturing on March 1, 2046. On April 11, 2016, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to maturity, its $100 million in principal amount of 6.15% first mortgage bonds, Series H, due April 2019. In accordance with the redemption provisions of the original terms of the notes, the redemption included payment by Idaho Power of a make-whole premium of $14 million. The make-whole premium resulted in a current income tax deduction, which under Idaho Power's regulatory flow-through tax accounting produced an income tax benefit of approximately $5.6 million recorded in the second quarter of 2016. Idaho Power also expects to receive an incremental net benefit to net income as a result of the lower interest rate of the notes issued in March 2016 compared with the interest rate associated with the redeemed notes. Idaho Power used a portion of the net proceeds of the March 2016 sale of first mortgage bonds, medium-term notes to effect the redemption. The companies do not expect to redeem any existing outstanding debt during 2017.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power seek to maintain capital structures of approximately 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, and maintaining this ratio influences IDACORP's and Idaho Power's debt and equity issuance decisions. As of December 31, 2016, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's capital structures, as calculated for purposes of applicable debt covenants, were as follows:\n\nIDACORP and Idaho Power generally maintain their cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, money market funds, and bank deposits.\nOperating Cash Flows\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's principal sources of cash flows from operations are Idaho Power's sales of electricity and transmission capacity. Significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of fuel and power, other operating expenses, interest, income taxes, and pension plan contributions. Operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather conditions, rates and the outcome of regulatory proceedings, and economic conditions. As fuel and purchased power are significant uses of cash, Idaho Power has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of the fluctuation in those costs. However, if actual costs rise above the level allowed in retail rates, deferral balances increase (reflected as a regulatory asset), negatively affecting operating cash flows until such time as those costs, with interest, are recovered from customers.\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating cash inflows in 2016 were $348 million and $311 million, respectively, a decrease of $5 million for IDACORP and $35 million decrease for Idaho Power when compared with 2015. Significant items that affected the companies' operating cash flows in 2016 relative to 2015 were as follows:\n \u2022 changes in regulatory assets and liabilities, mostly related to the relative amounts of power supply and fixed costs deferred and collected under the Idaho rate mechanisms, decreased operating cash inflows by $19 million; \n \u2022 changes in deferred taxes and in taxes accrued and receivable combined to decrease cash flows by $3 million and $34 million at IDACORP and Idaho Power, respectively; \n \u2022 Idaho Power received $24 million of distributions from IERCo's investment in BCC for 2016, compared with $11 million in 2015. Changes in distributions from year to year are primarily driven by changes in the timing of cash needs associated with BCC; and \n \u2022 comparative changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities increased cash flows by $7 million in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily related to changes in accounts payable due to timing of payments. \nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating cash inflows in 2015 were $353 million and $346 million, respectively, a decrease of $11 million for IDACORP and a slight increase for Idaho Power when compared with 2014. Significant items that affected the companies' operating cash flows in 2015 relative to 2014 were as follows:\n \u2022 changes in regulatory assets and liabilities, mostly related to the relative amounts of power supply and fixed costs deferred and collected under the Idaho rate mechanisms, decreased operating cash inflows by $18 million; \n \u2022 Idaho Power made $39 million of cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan in 2015, compared with $30 million of cash contributions during 2014; \n \u2022 changes in deferred taxes and in taxes accrued and receivable combined to increase cash flows by $34 million and $50 million at IDACORP and Idaho Power, respectively; and \n \u2022 comparative changes in working capital balances due primarily to timing-principally related to a smaller decrease in accounts receivable in 2015 compared to the decrease in accounts receivable in 2014. Changes in accounts receivable balances reduced operating cash flows $16 million and $18 million for IDACORP and Idaho Power, respectively. \nInvesting Cash Flows\nInvesting activities consist primarily of capital expenditures related to new construction and improvements to Idaho Power's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. Idaho Power's construction expenditures, including the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction, were $297 million, $294 million, and $274 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. These capital expenditures were primarily for construction of utility infrastructure needed to address Idaho Power's aging plant and equipment, customer growth, and environmental and regulatory compliance requirements. As discussed in \"Capital Requirements\" below, Idaho Power received $8 million and $11 million in 2016 and 2015 from Boardman-to-Hemingway project joint permitting participants relating to a portion of these construction expenditures.\nIdaho Power has a Rabbi trust designated to provide funding for obligations of its nonqualified defined benefit plans. In the Rabbi trust, Idaho Power purchased $15 million, $14 million, and $8 million of available-for-sale securities in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In 2016 and 2015, Idaho Power received $16 million and $34 million, respectively, of proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities and used $10 million and $30 million of the proceeds, respectively, to acquire company-owned life insurance.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nFinancing activities provide supplemental cash for both day-to-day operations and capital requirements as needed. Idaho Power funds liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital, managing commodity price risk, and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations, debt offerings, commercial paper markets, credit facilities, and capital contributions from IDACORP. IDACORP funds its cash requirements, such as payment of taxes, capital contributions to Idaho Power, and non-utility operating expenses through cash flows from operations, commercial paper markets, sales of common stock, and credit facilities. The following are significant items and transactions that affected financing cash flows in 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n \u2022 on March 10, 2016, Idaho Power issued $120 million in principal amount of 4.05% first mortgage bonds Series J, maturing March 1, 2046; \n \u2022 on April 11, 2016, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to maturity, $100 million of its 6.15% first mortgage bonds, Series H, due April 1, 2019, and paid a related make-whole premium of $14 million; \n \u2022 on March 6, 2015, Idaho Power issued $250 million in principal amount of 3.65% first mortgage bonds, Series J, maturing on March 1, 2045; \n \u2022 on April 23, 2015, Idaho Power redeemed, prior to maturity, $120 million in principal amount of 6.025% first mortgage bonds, medium-term notes due July 2018, and paid a related make-whole premium of $18 million; \n \u2022 IDACORP and Idaho Power paid dividends of approximately $105 million, $97 million, and $88 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively; \n \u2022 IDACORP's net change in commercial paper borrowings provided cash of $2 million in 2016 and used cash of $11 million and $23 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively; and \n \u2022 Idaho Power borrowed $22 million in commercial paper in December 2016. \nFinancing Programs and Available Liquidity\nIDACORP Equity Programs: In recent years IDACORP has entered into sales agency agreements under which IDACORP could offer and sell shares of its common stock from time to time through BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC as IDACORP's agent. The most recent agency agreement terminated in May 2016, but IDACORP may choose to enter into a new sales agency agreement in the future. On May 20, 2016, IDACORP filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which became effective upon filing, for the potential offer and sale of an unspecified amount of shares of common stock. As of the date of this report, IDACORP is assessing whether to execute a new sales agency agreement for the issuance and sale of common stock, as the company does not anticipate issuing any shares of its common stock outside of its equity or deferral compensation programs in 2017.\nSince 2012, IDACORP has not used original issue shares of common stock for the IDACORP, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan or the Idaho Power Company Employee Savings Plan, but instead plan administrators have used market purchases of IDACORP common stock. However, IDACORP may determine at any time to use original issuances of common stock under those plans. As noted above, an important component of that determination will be IDACORP's and Idaho Power's capital structure.\nIdaho Power First Mortgage Bonds: Idaho Power's issuance of long-term indebtedness is subject to the approval of the IPUC, OPUC, and Wyoming Public Service Commission (WPSC). In April and May 2016, Idaho Power received orders from the IPUC, OPUC, and WPSC authorizing Idaho Power to issue and sell from time to time up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities and first mortgage bonds, subject to conditions specified in the orders. Authority from the IPUC is effective through May 31, 2019, subject to extension upon request to the IPUC. The OPUC's and WPSC's orders do not impose a time limitation for issuances, but the OPUC order does impose a number of other conditions, including a requirement that the interest rates for the debt securities or first mortgage bonds fall within either (a) designated spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury rates or (b) a maximum interest rate limit of seven percent.\nOn September 27, 2016, Idaho Power entered into a selling agency agreement with seven banks named in the agreement in connection with the potential issuance and sale from time to time of up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds, secured medium term notes, Series K (Series K Notes), under Idaho Power's Indenture of Mortgage and Deed\nof Trust, dated as of October 1, 1937, as amended and supplemented (Indenture). At the same time, Idaho Power entered into the Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 1, 2016, to the Indenture (Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture). The Forty-eighth Supplemental Indenture provides for, among other items, (a) the issuance of up to $500 million in aggregate principal amount of Series K Notes pursuant to the Indenture and (b) the increase of the maximum amount of obligations to be secured by the Indenture to $2.5 billion (which maximum amount may be further increased or decreased by Idaho Power without the consent of the holders of first mortgage bonds). As of the date of this report, Idaho Power had not sold any first mortgage bonds, including Series K Notes, or debt securities under the selling agency agreement.\nThe issuance of first mortgage bonds requires that Idaho Power meet interest coverage and security provisions set forth in the Indenture. Future issuances of first mortgage bonds are subject to satisfaction of covenants and security provisions set forth in the Indenture, market conditions, regulatory authorizations, and covenants contained in other financing agreements.\nThe Indenture limits the amount of first mortgage bonds at any one time outstanding to $2.5 billion, and as a result the maximum amount of first mortgage bonds Idaho Power could issue as of December 31, 2016, was limited to approximately $759 million. Idaho Power may increase the $2.5 billion limit on the maximum amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding by filing a supplemental indenture with the trustee as provided in the Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust. Separately, the Indenture also limits the amount of additional first mortgage bonds that Idaho Power may issue to the sum of (a) the principal amount of retired first mortgage bonds and (b) 60 percent of total unfunded property additions, as defined in the Indenture. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power could issue approximately $1.7 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on retired first mortgage bonds and total unfunded property additions.\nRefer to Note 4 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information regarding long-term financing arrangements.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power Credit Facilities: In November 2015, IDACORP and Idaho Power entered into credit agreements for $100 million and $300 million credit facilities, respectively. These facilities replaced IDACORP's and Idaho Power's existing Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreements, dated October 26, 2011, as amended. Each of the credit facilities may be used for general corporate purposes and commercial paper back-up. IDACORP's facility permits borrowings under a revolving line of credit of up to $100 million at any one time outstanding, including swingline loans not to exceed $10 million at any time and letters of credit not to exceed $50 million at any time. IDACORP's facility may be increased, subject to specified conditions, to $150 million. Idaho Power's facility permits borrowings through the issuance of loans and standby letters of credit of up to $300 million at any one time outstanding, including swingline loans not to exceed $30 million at any one time and letters of credit not to exceed $100 million at any time. Idaho Power's facility may be increased, subject to specified conditions, to $450 million. The interest rates for any borrowings under the facilities are based on either (1) a floating rate that is equal to the highest of the prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.5 percent, or LIBOR rate plus 1.0 percent, or (2) the LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, provided that the federal funds rate and LIBOR rate will not be less than zero percent. The applicable margin is based on IDACORP's or Idaho Power's, as applicable, senior unsecured long-term indebtedness credit rating, as set forth on a schedule to the credit agreements. The companies also pay a facility fee based on the respective company's credit rating for senior unsecured long-term debt securities.\nEach facility contains a covenant requiring each company to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization equal to or less than 65 percent as of the end of each fiscal quarter. In determining the leverage ratio, consolidated indebtedness\u201d broadly includes all indebtedness of the respective borrower and its subsidiaries, including, in some instances, indebtedness evidenced by certain hybrid securities (as defined in the credit agreement). Consolidated total capitalization\u201d is calculated as the sum of all consolidated indebtedness, consolidated stockholders' equity of the borrower and its subsidiaries, and the aggregate value of outstanding hybrid securities. At December 31, 2016, the leverage ratios for IDACORP and Idaho Power were 45 percent and 47 percent, respectively. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to utilize the credit facilities is conditioned upon their continued compliance with the leverage ratio covenants included in the credit facilities. There are additional covenants, subject to exceptions, that prohibit certain mergers, acquisitions, and investments, restrict the creation of certain liens, and prohibit entering into any agreements restricting dividend payments from any material subsidiary. At December 31, 2016, IDACORP and Idaho Power believe they were in compliance with all facility covenants. Further, IDACORP and Idaho Power do not believe they will be in violation or breach of their respective debt covenants during 2017.\nThe events of default under both facilities include, without limitation, non-payment of principal, interest, or fees; materially false representations or warranties; breach of covenants; bankruptcy or insolvency events; condemnation of property; cross-default to certain other indebtedness; failure to pay certain judgments; change of control; failure of IDACORP to own free and\nclear of liens the voting stock of Idaho Power; the occurrence of specified events or the incurring of specified liabilities relating to benefit plans; and the incurring of certain environmental liabilities, subject, in certain instances, to cure periods.\nUpon any event of default relating to the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of IDACORP or Idaho Power or the appointment of a receiver, the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the applicable facility and to issue letters of credit will automatically terminate and all unpaid obligations will become due and payable. Upon any other event of default, the lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the outstanding loans or greater than 50 percent of the aggregate commitments (required lenders) or the administrative agent with the consent of the required lenders may terminate or suspend the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and to issue letters of credit under the facility and/or declare the obligations to be due and payable. During an event of default under the facilities, the lenders may, at their option, increase the applicable interest rates then in effect and the letter of credit fee by 2.0 percentage points per annum. A ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the cost of borrowing, but would not result in a default or acceleration of the debt under the facilities. However, if Idaho Power's ratings are downgraded below investment grade, Idaho Power must extend or renew its authority for borrowings under its IPUC and OPUC regulatory orders.\nWhile the credit facilities provide for an original maturity date of November 6, 2020, the credit agreements grant IDACORP and Idaho Power the right to request up to two one-year extensions, in each case subject to certain conditions. On November 7, 2016, IDACORP and Idaho Power executed the first extension agreement with the consent of all the lenders, extending the maturity date under both credit agreements to November 5, 2021. No other terms of the credit facilities, including the amount of permitted borrowing under the credit agreements, were affected by the extensions.\nWithout additional approval from the IPUC, the OPUC, and the WPSC, the aggregate amount of short-term borrowings by Idaho Power at any one time outstanding may not exceed $450 million. Idaho Power has obtained approval of the state public utility commissions of Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming for the issuance of short-term borrowings through November 2022.\nIDACORP and Idaho Power Commercial Paper: IDACORP and Idaho Power have commercial paper programs under which they issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the available capacity under their respective credit facilities, described above. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities are available to the companies to support borrowings under their commercial paper programs. The commercial paper issuances are used to provide an additional financing source for the companies' short-term liquidity needs. The maturities of the commercial paper issuances will vary, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. Individual instruments carry a fixed rate during their respective terms, although the interest rates are reflective of current market conditions, subjecting the companies to fluctuations in interest rates.\nAvailable Short-Term Borrowing Liquidity\nThe following table outlines available short-term borrowing liquidity as of the dates specified: \nThe table below presents additional information about short-term commercial paper borrowing during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: \nAt February 17, 2017, IDACORP had no loans outstanding under its credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding, and Idaho Power had no loans outstanding under its credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding.\nImpact of Credit Ratings on Liquidity and Collateral Obligations\nIDACORP's and Idaho Power's access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, depends in part on their respective credit ratings. The following table outlines the ratings of Idaho Power's and IDACORP's securities, and the ratings outlook, by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services as of the date of this report:\n\nThese security ratings reflect the views of the ratings agencies. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings and, accordingly, each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nIdaho Power maintains margin agreements relating to its wholesale commodity contracts that allow performance assurance collateral to be requested of and/or posted with certain counterparties. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power had posted no performance assurance collateral. Should Idaho Power experience a reduction in its credit rating on its unsecured debt to below investment grade, Idaho Power could be subject to requests by its wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral, and counterparties to derivative instruments and other forward contracts could request immediate payment or demand immediate ongoing full daily collateralization on derivative instruments and contracts in net liability positions. Based upon Idaho Power's current energy and fuel portfolio and market conditions as of December 31, 2016, the amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a downgrade to below investment grade is approximately $11.6 million. To minimize capital requirements, Idaho Power actively monitors its portfolio exposure and the potential exposure to additional requests for performance assurance collateral through sensitivity analysis.\nCapital Requirements\nIdaho Power's construction expenditures, excluding AFUDC, were $287 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The table below presents Idaho Power's estimated cash requirements for construction, excluding AFUDC, for 2017 through 2021 (in millions of dollars). However, given the uncertainty associated with the timing of infrastructure projects and associated expenditures, actual expenditures and their timing could deviate substantially from those set forth in the table.\n\nInfrastructure Projects: A significant portion of expected capital expenditures included in the five-year forecast above relate to a large number of small projects as Idaho Power continues to add to its system to accommodate growth and improve reliability and operational effectiveness. These projects involve significant capital expenditures. Examples of anticipated system enhancements planned for 2017 through 2021 and estimated costs include the following:\n \u2022 $35-$65 million per year for transmission system projects other than the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West projects; \n \u2022 $75-$95 million per year for construction and replacement of distribution lines and stations, including replacement of underground distribution cables; \n \u2022 $25-$45 million per year for ongoing improvements and replacements at coal- and natural gas-fired plants; \n \u2022 $45-$65 million per year for hydroelectric plant improvement programs, including relicensing and mitigation costs; and \n \u2022 $45-$65 million per year for general plant improvements, such as land and buildings, vehicles, information technology, and communication equipment. \nOther Major Infrastructure Projects: Idaho Power has recently completed or is engaged in the development of a number of significant projects and has entered into arrangements with third parties for joint development of infrastructure projects. The most notable projects are described below.\nJim Bridger Plant Selective Catalytic Reduction Equipment: Idaho Power and the plant co-owners recently completed installation of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions at the Jim Bridger power plant, in order to comply with regional haze rules. The regional haze rules provided for installation of SCR on unit 3 and unit 4. The rules provide for an equivalent technology for NOx reductions on unit 2 by 2021 and unit 1 by 2022. Idaho Power has expended $100 million, excluding AFUDC, on SCR installation at units 3 and 4 through December 31, 2016. The unit 3 SCR was operating as of November 2015, and the unit 4 SCR was operating as of November 2016. In light of the uncertainty resulting from pending environmental regulation and the substantial estimated cost of the SCR installation, as of the date of this report, Idaho Power is assessing whether to move forward with the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger power plant. The expected capital expenditures in the table above do not include any estimated expenditures relating to the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2.\nBoardman-to-Hemingway Transmission Line: The Boardman-to-Hemingway line, a proposed 300-mile, 500-kV transmission project between a station near Boardman, Oregon, and the Hemingway station near Boise, Idaho, would provide transmission service to meet future resource needs. The Boardman-to-Hemingway line was included in the preferred resource portfolio in Idaho Power's 2015 IRP. In January 2012, Idaho Power entered into a joint funding agreement with PacifiCorp and the Bonneville Power Administration to pursue permitting of the project. The joint funding agreement provides that Idaho Power's interest in the permitting phase of the project would be approximately 21 percent, and that during future negotiations relating to construction of the transmission line Idaho Power would seek to retain that percentage interest in the completed project. Assuming both other participants fund their full share of the total cost of the permitting phase of the project, Idaho Power's estimated share of the cost of the permitting phase of the project is approximately $44 million, including Idaho Power's AFUDC. Total cost estimates for the project are between $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, including AFUDC. This cost estimate excludes the impacts of inflation and price changes of materials and labor resources that may occur following the date of the estimate. Idaho Power's share of the permitting phase of the project (excluding AFUDC) is included in the capital requirements table above in addition to approximately $45 million of Idaho Power's share of costs related to early construction efforts primarily included in the periods 2019-2021. These preliminary estimates of Idaho Power's share of early construction costs could significantly change as the construction timeline nears and as the project participants further align on future activities and estimates.\nApproximately $87 million has been expended on the Boardman-to-Hemingway project through December 31, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the joint funding arrangements, Idaho Power has received approximately $42 million of that amount as reimbursement from the project participants as of December 31, 2016. Idaho Power has accrued in receivables approximately $16 million more that will be billed by Idaho Power in the future to the project participants for expenses Idaho Power has incurred, for a total amount reimbursable by joint permitting participants of $58 million. In addition to the $58 million amount, $6 million is subject to reimbursement at a later date from the joint permitting participants, assuming their continued participation in the project, for expenses Idaho Power incurred prior to execution of the joint funding arrangements. Joint permitting participants are obligated to reimburse Idaho Power for their share of any future project permitting expenditures incurred by Idaho Power. Idaho Power plans to seek recovery of its share of project costs through the regulatory process.\nThe permitting phase of the Boardman-to-Hemingway project is subject to federal review and approval by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the U.S. Forest Service, the Department of the Navy, the Army Corps of Engineers, and certain other federal agencies. The BLM, as the lead federal agency on the National Environmental Policy Act review, issued a final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the project on November 25, 2016. As of the date of this report, the BLM's schedule provides for the issuance of a record of decision in 2017. In the separate Oregon state permitting process, Idaho Power expects its amended preliminary application for site certificate to be deemed complete by the Oregon Department of Energy in 2017. Idaho Power is unable to determine an in-service date for the line but, given the status of ongoing permitting activities, expects the in-service date would be in 2023 or beyond.\nGateway West Transmission Line: Idaho Power and PacifiCorp are pursuing the joint development of the Gateway West project, a 500-kV transmission project between a station located near Douglas, Wyoming and the Hemingway station. In January 2012, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp entered a joint funding agreement for permitting of the project. Idaho Power's estimated cost for the permitting phase of the Gateway West project is approximately $60 million, including AFUDC. Idaho Power has expended approximately $32 million on the permitting phase of the project through December 31, 2016. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates the total cost for its share of the project (including both permitting and construction) to be between $200 million and $400 million, including AFUDC. Idaho Power's share of the permitting phase of the project (excluding AFUDC) is included in the capital requirements table above in addition to approximately $35 million of Idaho Power's share of costs related to early construction efforts primarily in the periods 2019-2021. These preliminary estimates of Idaho Power's share of early construction costs could significantly change as the construction timeline nears and as the project participants further align on future activities and estimates.\nThe permitting phase of the Gateway West project is subject to review and approval of the BLM. The BLM released its record of decision in November 2013 for eight of the ten transmission line segments. On January 20, 2017, the BLM released its record of decision for the remaining two transmission line segments. In September 2016, the U.S. Department of Interior Board of Land Appeals affirmed the BLM's November 2013 record of decision, which was challenged by certain third-parties. In February 2017, the State of Idaho and others filed with the U.S. Department of Interior Board of Land Appeals notices of appeal and requests for a stay of the BLM's record of decision.\nHells Canyon Complex Relicensing: The HCC, located on the Snake River where it forms the border between Idaho and Oregon, provides approximately 68 percent of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating nameplate capacity and 32 percent of its total generating nameplate capacity. Idaho Power has been engaged in the process of obtaining from the FERC a new long-term license for the HCC. The past and anticipated future costs associated with obtaining a new long-term license for the HCC are significant. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates that the annual costs it will incur to obtain a new long-term license for the HCC, including AFUDC but excluding costs expected to be incurred for complying with the license after issuance, are likely to range from $25 million to $35 million until issuance of the license, which Idaho Power estimates will occur no earlier than 2021. Idaho Power expects that the annual capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses associated with compliance with the terms and conditions of the long-term license could also be substantial, but the company is currently unable to estimate those costs in light of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate terms and conditions that may be included in the license. Idaho Power intends to seek recovery of those relicensing and compliance costs in rates through the regulatory process. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in this MD&A for additional details relating to the relicensing process.\nEnvironmental Regulation Costs: Idaho Power anticipates that it will incur significant expenditures for the installation of environmental controls at its coal-fired plants and for its hydroelectric relicensing efforts. The near-term cost estimates for environmental matters are summarized in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business\" of this report. The capital portion of these amounts is included in the Capital Requirements table above but does not include costs related to possible changes in current or new environmental laws or regulations and enforcement policies that may be enacted in response to issues such as climate change and emissions from coal-fired and gas-fired generation plants.\nLong-Term Resource Planning: The IPUC and OPUC require that Idaho Power prepare biennially an IRP. Idaho Power filed its most recent IRP in June 2015 and expects to file its 2017 IRP in June 2017. The IRP seeks to forecast Idaho Power's loads and resources for a 20-year period, analyzes potential supply-side and demand-side resource options, and identifies potential near-term and long-term actions. The 2015 IRP included as near-term action items the continued permitting and planning for the Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission line and further investigation of the early retirement of the North Valmy power plant in collaboration with the plant's co-owner. Idaho Power filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC in October and November 2016, respectively, requesting accelerated depreciation of the North Valmy plant in connection with the potential early closure of the plant, which remain pending. The near-term action plan also included commencement of an economic evaluation of environmental control retrofits for units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger power plant. Additional information on Idaho Power's 2015 IRP and 2017 IRP is included in Part I, Item 1 - \"Business - Resource Planning\" in this report.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Contributions and Recovery\nIdaho Power contributed $40 million, $39 million, and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plan in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Idaho Power estimates that it has no minimum contribution requirement for 2017, though it plans to contribute between $20 million and $40 million to the pension plan during 2017. Idaho Power's contributions are made in a continued effort to balance the regulatory collection of these expenditures with the amount and timing of contributions to mitigate the cost of being in an underfunded position. In 2017 and beyond, Idaho Power expects continuing significant contribution obligations under the pension plan. Refer to Note 11 - \"Benefit Plans\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and the section titled \"Contractual Obligations\" below in this MD&A for information relating to those obligations.\nIdaho Power defers its Idaho-jurisdiction pension expense as a regulatory asset until recovered from Idaho customers. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power's deferral balance associated with the Idaho jurisdiction was $105 million. Deferred pension costs are expected to be amortized to expense to match the revenues received when contributions are recovered through rates. Idaho Power only records a carrying charge on the unrecovered balance of cash contributions. The IPUC has authorized Idaho Power to recover and amortize $17 million of deferred pension costs annually, and has applied $68 million against the deferred amount under its Idaho sharing mechanisms since 2011. The primary impact of pension contributions is on the timing of cash flows, as cost recovery lags behind the timing of contributions.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents IDACORP's and Idaho Power's contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2016, for the respective periods in which they are due:\n Payments Due by Period Total 2017 2018-2019 2020-2021 Thereafter (millions of dollars) Long-term debt(1) $ 1,766 $ 1 $ - $ 230 $ 1,535 Future interest payments(2) 1,464 82 163 151 1,068 Operating leases(3) 48 3 8 8 29 Purchase obligations: Cogeneration and small power production(4) 4,309 229 465 465 3,150 Fuel supply agreements 206 57 31 17 101 Other(4) 181 39 40 22 80 Pension and postretirement benefit plans(5) 246 8 78 115 45 Other long-term liabilities 1 1 - - - Total $ 8,221 $ 420 $ 785 $ 1,008 $ 6,008 (1) For additional information, see Note 4 - Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. (2) Future interest payments are calculated based on the assumption that all debt is outstanding until maturity. For debt instruments with variable rates, interest is calculated for all future periods using the rates in effect at December 31, 2016. (3) The operating leases include right-of-way easements. Approximately $13 million of the obligations included have contracts that do not specify terms related to expiration. As these contracts are presumed to continue indefinitely, ten years of information, estimated based on current contract terms, has been included in the table for presentation purposes. (4) Approximately $6 million of the amounts in cogeneration and small power production and $23 million of the amounts in other purchase obligations are contracts that do not specify terms related to expiration. As these contracts are presumed to continue indefinitely, ten years of information, estimated based on current contract terms, has been included in the table for presentation purposes. Other purchase obligations also includes Idaho Power's estimated proportionate funding obligation for goods and services under non-fuel purchase agreements at its jointly-owned generation facilities. In some instances, Idaho Power is not a direct party to an underlying purchase agreement, but is obligated under the instruments governing the joint ventures to reimburse the co-owner for payments the co-owner makes pursuant to the purchase agreement. Those estimated amounts have been included in the table above. (5) Idaho Power estimates pension contributions based on actuarial data. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power cannot estimate pension contributions beyond 2021 with any level of precision, and amounts through 2021 are estimates only and are subject to change. For more information on pension and postretirement plans, refer to Note 11 - \"Benefit Plans\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. \nDividends\nThe amount and timing of dividends paid on IDACORP's common stock are within the discretion of IDACORP's board of directors. IDACORP's board of directors reviews the dividend rate periodically to determine its appropriateness in light of IDACORP's current and long-term financial position and results of operations, capital requirements, rating agency considerations, contractual and regulatory restrictions, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and Idaho Power in particular, competitive conditions, and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant. The ability of IDACORP to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power.\nIDACORP has a dividend policy that provides for a target long-term dividend payout ratio of between 50 and 60 percent of sustainable IDACORP earnings, with the flexibility to achieve that payout ratio over time and to adjust the payout ratio or to deviate from the target payout ratio from time to time based on the various factors that drive IDACORP's board of directors' dividend decisions. Notwithstanding the dividend policy adopted by IDACORP's board of directors, the dividends IDACORP pays remain in the discretion of the board of directors who, when evaluating the dividend amount, will continue to take into account the factors above, among others. In September of 2014, 2015, and 2016, IDACORP's board of directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share, $0.51 per share, and $0.55 per share of IDACORP common stock, respectively. IDACORP's dividends during 2016 were 53 percent of actual 2016 earnings.\nFor additional information relating to IDACORP and Idaho Power dividends, including restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends, see Note 6 - Common Stock\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nContingencies and Proceedings\nIDACORP and Idaho Power are involved in a number of litigation, alternative dispute resolution, and administrative proceedings, and are subject to claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, that could affect their future results of operations and financial condition. In many instances IDACORP and Idaho Power are unable to predict the outcomes of the matters or estimate the impact the proceedings may have on their financial positions, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIdaho Power is also actively monitoring various environmental regulations that may have a significant impact on its future operations. Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing, and compliance plans for these environmental matters, Idaho Power is unable to determine the financial impact of potential new regulations but does believe that future capital investment for infrastructure and modifications to its electric generating facilities to comply with these regulations could be significant.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough a self-bonding mechanism, Idaho Power guarantees its portion of reclamation activities and obligations at BCC, of which IERCo owns a one-third interest. This guarantee, which is renewed annually with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, was $71 million at December 31, 2016, representing IERCo's one-third share of BCC's total reclamation obligation of $212 million. BCC has a reclamation trust fund set aside specifically for the purpose of paying these reclamation costs. At December 31, 2016, the value of the reclamation trust fund totaled $78 million. During 2016, the reclamation trust fund distributed approximately $6 million for reclamation activity costs associated with the BCC surface mine. BCC periodically assesses the adequacy of the reclamation trust fund and its estimate of future reclamation costs. To ensure that the reclamation trust fund maintains adequate reserves, BCC adds a per-ton surcharge to coal sales. Because of the existence of the fund and the ability to apply a per-ton surcharge, the estimated fair value of this guarantee is minimal.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nIntroduction\nIdaho Power's regulatory strategy takes into consideration short-term and long-term needs for rate relief and involves several factors that can affect the timing of rate filings. These factors include, among others, in-service dates of major capital investments, the timing of changes in major revenue and expense items, and customer growth rates. Idaho Power's most recent general rate cases in Idaho and Oregon were filed during 2011, and Idaho Power filed a large single-issue rate case for the Langley Gulch power plant in Idaho and Oregon in 2012. These significant rate cases resulted in the resetting of base rates in both Idaho and Oregon during 2012. Idaho Power also reset its base-rate power supply expenses in the Idaho jurisdiction for purposes of updating the collection of costs through retail rates in 2014, but without a resulting net increase in rates. Between general rate cases, Idaho Power relies upon customer growth, power cost adjustment mechanisms, tariff riders, and other mechanisms to reduce the impact of regulatory lag, which refers to the period of time between making an investment or incurring an expense and recovering that investment or expense and earning a return. Management's regulatory focus in recent years has been largely on regulatory settlement stipulations and the design of rate mechanisms. During 2017, Idaho Power plans to continue to assess its need to file, and timing of, a general rate case in its two retail jurisdictions, based on its consideration of the factors described above.\nNotable Retail Rate Changes in Idaho and Oregon\nIncluded in the table that follows are notable regulatory developments during 2014, 2015, and 2016 that affected Idaho Power's results for the periods. Also refer to Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of regulatory mechanism and associated orders of the IPUC and OPUC, which should be read in conjunction with the discussion of regulatory matters in this MD&A.\n\nIdaho and Oregon General Rate Cases and Base Rate Adjustments\nEffective January 1, 2012, Idaho Power implemented new Idaho base rates resulting from the regulatory settlement of a general rate case filing Idaho Power made in 2011. In the general rate case, the IPUC issued an order approving a settlement stipulation that provided for an overall 7.86 percent authorized rate of return on an Idaho-jurisdiction rate base of approximately $2.36 billion. The settlement stipulation resulted in a $34.0 million overall increase in Idaho Power's annual Idaho-jurisdictional base rate revenues. Neither the IPUC's order nor the settlement stipulation specified an authorized rate of return on equity.\nEffective March 1, 2012, Idaho Power implemented new Oregon base rates resulting from its receipt of an order from the OPUC approving a settlement stipulation in its general rate case proceedings that provided for a $1.8 million base rate revenue increase, a rate of return on equity of 9.9 percent, and an overall rate of return of 7.757 percent in the Oregon jurisdiction.\nIdaho and Oregon base rates were subsequently adjusted again in 2012, in connection with Idaho Power's completion of the Langley Gulch power plant. In June 2012, the IPUC issued an order approving a $58.1 million increase in annual Idaho-jurisdiction base rate revenues, effective July 1, 2012, for inclusion of the investment and associated costs of the plant in rates. The order also provided for a $335.9 million increase in Idaho rate base. On September 20, 2012, the OPUC issued an order approving a $3.0 million increase in annual Oregon jurisdiction base rate revenues, effective October 1, 2012, for inclusion of the investment and associated costs of the plant in Oregon rates.\nIn March 2014, the IPUC issued an order approving Idaho Power's application requesting an increase of approximately $106 million in the normalized or \"base level\" net power supply expense on a total-system basis to be used to update base rates and in the determination of the PCA rate that became effective June 1, 2014. Approval of the order removed the Idaho-jurisdictional portion of those expenses (approximately $99 million) from collection via the PCA mechanism and instead results in collecting that portion through base rates.\nNon-Base Rate Idaho Regulatory Settlement Stipulations\nSettlement Stipulation for 2012 to 2014: In December 2011, the IPUC issued an order, separate from the then-pending Idaho general rate case proceeding, approving a settlement stipulation that allowed Idaho Power to, in certain circumstances, amortize additional ADITC if Idaho Power's actual Idaho ROE for 2012, 2013, or 2014 was less than 9.5 percent, to help achieve a 9.5 percent Idaho ROE for the applicable year. The more specific terms and conditions of the December 2011 Idaho settlement stipulation are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters - Notable Idaho Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Under the December 2011 settlement stipulation, when Idaho Power's actual Idaho ROE for any of those years exceeded 10.0 percent, Idaho Power was required to share a portion of its Idaho-jurisdiction earnings with Idaho customers.\nSettlement Stipulation for 2015 to 2019: In October 2014, the IPUC issued an order approving an extension, with modifications, of the terms of the December 2011 settlement stipulation for the period from 2015 through 2019, or until the terms are otherwise modified or terminated by order of the IPUC or the full $45 million of additional ADITC contemplated by the settlement stipulation has been amortized. The more specific terms and conditions of the October 2014 settlement stipulation are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters - Notable Idaho Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. IDACORP and Idaho Power believe that the terms allowing amortization of additional ADITC in the October 2014 settlement stipulation provide the companies with a greater degree of earnings stability than would be possible without the terms of the stipulation in effect.\nIn 2016, Idaho Power's Idaho ROE was between 9.5 and 10.0 percent, and thus Idaho Power recorded no additional ADITC amortization and no provision for sharing with customers. Accordingly, at December 31, 2016, the full $45 million of additional ADITC remains available for future use under the terms of the settlement stipulation.\nIdaho Power recorded the following for sharing with customers under the December 2011 and October 2014 Idaho Settlement Stipulations (in millions):\n\nModifications to Idaho Annual Rate Adjustment Mechanisms\nPCA Mechanism: In July 2014, the IPUC opened a docket pursuant to which Idaho Power, the IPUC Staff, and other interested parties evaluated Idaho Power's application of the true-up component of the PCA mechanism. The July 2014 docket arose from a prior order of the IPUC, which noted that the IPUC Staff believed that Idaho Power's application of the true-up component introduced a line-loss bias that inflated the true-up revenue that Idaho Power collects under the PCA. In May 2015, the IPUC approved a settlement stipulation that modified the calculation of the true-up component of the PCA mechanism. The mechanics of the PCA mechanism and the terms of the PCA settlement stipulation are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nFCA Mechanism:Also in July 2014, the IPUC opened a docket to allow Idaho Power, the IPUC Staff, and other interested parties to further evaluate the IPUC Staff's concerns regarding the application of the FCA. Concerns cited included the application of weather-normalization, the customer count methodology, the rate adjustment cap, cross-subsidization issues, and whether the FCA is in fact effectively removing Idaho Power's disincentive to aggressively pursue energy efficiency programs.\nThe FCA is designed to remove Idaho Power's financial disincentive to invest in energy efficiency programs by separating (or decoupling) the recovery of fixed costs from the variable kilowatt-hour charge and linking it instead to a set amount per customer. Stated generally, under the FCA Idaho Power charges residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less \"actual fixed costs per customer\" than the base level of fixed costs that the IPUC authorized for recovery through rates in the last general rate case, and Idaho Power credits those customers when its \"actual fixed costs per customer\" recovered exceed that base level of fixed costs. The FCA is adjusted each year to collect, or refund, the difference between the authorized fixed-cost recovery amount and the actual fixed costs recovered by Idaho Power during the year.\nIn years when actual sales per customer are higher than weather-normalized sales due to high summer or low winter temperatures, Idaho Power expects that the new FCA methodology will be less favorable to Idaho Power than the prior methodology. Conversely, Idaho Power expects that the new FCA methodology will be more favorable to Idaho Power in years when actual sales per customer are lower than weather normalized sales due to cooler summer or warmer winter temperatures.\nDeferred Net Power Supply Costs\nDeferred power supply costs represent certain differences between Idaho Power's actual net power supply costs and the costs included in its retail rates, the latter being based on annual forecasts of power supply costs. Deferred power supply costs are recorded on the balance sheets for future recovery or refund through customer rates. Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions provide for annual adjustments to the rates charged to retail customers. The power cost adjustment mechanisms and associated financial impacts are described in \"Results of Operations\" in this MD&A and in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nFactors that have influenced power cost adjustment rate changes in recent years include year-to-year volatility in hydroelectric generation conditions, market energy prices and the volume of off-system sales, power purchase costs from renewable energy projects, and revenue sharing under Idaho regulatory settlement stipulations. From year to year, these factors can vary significantly, which can result in significant accruals and deferrals under the power cost adjustment mechanisms. The power cost adjustment rate changes reflected in the table under the heading \"Notable Retail Rate Changes in Idaho and Oregon\" are illustrative of the volatility of net power supply costs and the impact on power cost adjustment rates.\nAs noted above under the heading \"Idaho and Oregon General Rate Cases and Base Rate Adjustments,\" in light of the existence of permanent increases in power supply costs, in March 2014 the IPUC issued an order approving Idaho Power's application requesting recovery of a portion of its ongoing power supply costs through base rates rather than through the PCA mechanism.\nThe following table summarizes the change in deferred net power supply costs over the prior two years.\n\nAnticipated Participation in Western Energy Imbalance Market\nIn January 2017, the IPUC issued an order authorizing Idaho Power's requested deferral accounting treatment for costs associated with joining the Western EIM. Idaho Power can defer costs incurred until the earlier of when Idaho Power requests recovery of the costs and the deferral balance or the end of 2018. Idaho Power anticipates that it will begin participating in the Western EIM in the spring of 2018. The Western EIM is intended to reduce the power supply costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, to integrate intermittent power from renewable generation sources more effectively, and to enhance reliability. Refer to Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to Idaho Power's anticipated participation in the Western EIM.\nOpen Access Transmission Tariff Rate Proceedings\nIdaho Power uses a formula rate for transmission service provided under its OATT, which allows transmission rates to be updated annually based primarily on financial and operational data Idaho Power files with the FERC. In August 2016, Idaho Power filed its 2016 final transmission rate with the FERC, reflecting a transmission rate of $25.52 per kW-year, to be effective for the period from October 1, 2016, to September 30, 2017. Idaho Power's final rate was based on a net annual transmission revenue requirement of $127.4 million. Historic OATT rate information is included in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nTransmission Revenues Associated with Asset Exchange Transaction\nEffective in October 2015, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp each transferred to the other certain interests in transmission-related equipment. In connection with that transaction, the companies terminated or amended a number of long-term agreements between Idaho Power and PacifiCorp related to the ownership and operation of transmission-related equipment and transmission services. In 2014, Idaho Power collected approximately $8 million in transmission revenues under long-term transmission agreements that were terminated in connection with the asset exchange transaction. As a result of the transaction and termination of those long-term transmission agreements, Idaho Power's OATT rate increased; however, in accordance with a FERC order, the current formula rate methodology will phase in the increase over a two-year period from October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2018.\nIn compliance with the IPUC's order approving the asset exchange transaction, Idaho Power submitted to the IPUC a request for verification that its regulatory accounting method reflecting a symmetrical tracking of changes in transmission revenues resulting specifically from the asset exchange with PacifiCorp complies with the IPUC's order. As an alternative proposed by Idaho Power to its symmetrical tracking, in August 2016, the IPUC ordered that any changes in transmission revenues resulting from the asset exchange will be addressed, prospectively, in Idaho Power's next general rate case.\nDepreciation Rate Requests\nIn October and November 2016, Idaho Power filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC, respectively, requesting authorization to (a) accelerate depreciation for the North Valmy coal-fired power plant, to allow the plant to be fully depreciated by December 31, 2025, (b) establish a balancing account to track the incremental costs and benefits associated with the accelerated depreciation date, and (c) adjust customer rates to recover the associated incremental annual levelized revenue requirement in an aggregate amount of $29.6 million. Idaho Power also filed applications with the IPUC and OPUC requesting approval to institute revised depreciation rates for Idaho Power's other electric plant-in-service and adjust base rates by an aggregate of $7.4 million to reflect the revised depreciation rates applied to electric plant-in-service balances subject to the most recent general rate case. The depreciation filings are described in Note 3 - \"Regulatory Matters\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRelicensing of Hydroelectric Projects\nOverview: Idaho Power, like other utilities that operate non-federal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways, obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the FERC. These licenses have a term of 30 to 50 years depending on the size, complexity, and cost of the project. The expiration dates for the FERC licenses for each of the facilities are included in Part I - Item 2 - \"Properties\" in this report. Costs for the relicensing of Idaho Power's hydroelectric projects are recorded in construction work in progress until a new multi-year license is issued by the FERC, at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service. Idaho Power will submit relicensing costs and costs related to new licenses to regulators for recovery\nthrough the ratemaking process and, in December 2016, submitted a request for a determination of prudency, which is described below. As of December 31, 2016, relicensing costs of $249 million for the HCC, Idaho Power's largest hydroelectric complex and a major relicensing effort, were included in construction work in progress. As of the date of this report, the IPUC authorizes Idaho Power to include in its Idaho jurisdiction rates approximately $6.5 million annually ($10.7 million when grossed-up for the effect of income taxes) of AFUDC relating to the HCC relicensing project. Collecting these amounts now will reduce the amount collected in the future once the HCC relicensing costs are approved for recovery in base rates. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power's regulatory liability for collection of AFUDC relating to the HCC was $103 million. In addition to the discussion below, refer to \"Environmental Matters\" in this MD&A for a discussion of environmental compliance under FERC licenses for Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating plants.\nHells Canyon Complex: The HCC, located on the Snake River where it forms the border between Idaho and Oregon, provides approximately 68 percent of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generating nameplate capacity and 32 percent of its total generating nameplate capacity. In July 2003, Idaho Power filed an application with the FERC for a new license in anticipation of the July 2005 expiration of the then-existing license. Since the expiration of that license, Idaho Power has been operating the project under annual licenses issued by the FERC. In December 2004, Idaho Power and eleven other parties, including National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), involved in the HCC relicensing process entered into an interim agreement that addresses the effects of the ongoing operations of the HCC on Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed species pending the relicensing of the project. In August 2007, the FERC Staff issued a final EIS for the HCC, which the FERC will use to determine whether, and under what conditions, to issue a new license for the project. The purpose of the final EIS is to inform the FERC, federal and state agencies, Native American tribes, and the public about the environmental effects of Idaho Power's operation of the HCC. Certain portions of the final EIS involve issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and formal consultations under the ESA, which remain unresolved.\nIn connection with its relicensing efforts, Idaho Power has filed water quality certification applications, required under Section 401 of the CWA, with the states of Idaho and Oregon requesting that each state certify that any discharges from the project comply with applicable state water quality standards. Section 401 of the CWA requires that a state either approve or deny a Section 401 water quality certification application within one year of the filing of the application or the state may be considered to have waived its certification authority under the CWA. As a consequence, Idaho Power has been filing and withdrawing its Section 401 certification applications with Oregon and Idaho on an annual basis while it has been working with the states to identify measures that will provide reasonable assurance that discharges from the HCC will adequately address applicable water quality standards. In the 2016 Section 401 certification application process, Oregon required Idaho Power to comply with fish passage and reintroduction conditions. Idaho's water quality certification, however, specifically forbids Idaho Power from reintroducing certain fish protected under the ESA, into Idaho's waters. On November 30, 2016, Idaho Power filed a petition with the FERC requesting that the FERC resolve the conflict between Oregon's and Idaho's conditions and declare that the FPA pre-empts the Oregon state law. In January 2017, the FERC issued an order denying Idaho Power's petition, stating that the petition for a declaratory order was premature, cannot realistically be considered separately from the issue of the states' certification authority under the CWA Section 401, and raises issues that are beyond the FERC's authority to decide. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power is considering other actions it may take to obtain a resolution of the issue.\nIn September 2007, in connection with the issuance of its final EIS, the FERC notified the NMFS and the USFWS of its determination that the licensing of the HCC was likely to adversely affect ESA-listed species, including the bull trout and fall Chinook salmon and steelhead, under the NMFS's and USFWS's jurisdiction and requested that the NMFS and USFWS initiate formal consultation under Section 7 of the ESA on the licensing of the HCC. Each of the NMFS and USFWS responded to the FERC that the conditions relating to the licensing of the HCC were not fully described or developed in the final EIS as the measures to address the water quality effects of the project were yet to be fully defined by the Section 401 certification process. The NMFS and USFWS therefore recommended that formal consultation under the ESA be delayed until the Section 401 certification process is completed.\nIdaho Power continues to work with Idaho and Oregon in the development of measures to provide reasonable assurance that any discharges from the HCC will comply with applicable state water quality standards so that appropriate water quality certifications can be issued for the project, and continues to cooperate with the USFWS, NMFS, and the FERC in an effort to address ESA concerns. Idaho Power has begun the process for construction of new aerated runners at the Brownlee project (part of the HCC) at an estimated cost of $50 million. The first of four units was installed in 2016 and Idaho Power plans to install one unit in each year from 2017 through 2019. Other measures that have been proposed or considered have included modification of spillways at two dams in the HCC to address total dissolved gas issues, and upstream watershed improvements or the installation of a temperature control structure to address water temperatures during a small portion of the year. If Idaho Power is required to take these or other additional measures to satisfy relicensing requirements, it could add substantially to\nproject costs. Idaho Power continues to work with the Oregon and Idaho Departments of Environmental Quality on the water quality certification issue and the water quality measures that will be required to obtain 401 certification.\nAs of the date of this report, Idaho Power is unable to predict the timing of issuance by the FERC of any license order or the ultimate capital investment and ongoing operating and maintenance costs Idaho Power will incur in complying with any new license. However, as of the date of this report, Idaho Power estimates that the annual costs it will incur to obtain a new long-term license for the HCC, including AFUDC but excluding costs expected to be incurred for complying with the license after issuance, are likely to range from $25 million to $35 million until issuance of the license, which Idaho Power estimates will occur no earlier than 2021. In light of the costs incurred and the considerable passage of time, in December 2016, Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC requesting a determination that Idaho Power's expenditures of $220.8 million through year-end 2015 on relicensing of the HCC were prudently incurred, and thus eligible for future inclusion in retail rates.\nRenewable Energy Standards and Contracts\nRenewable Portfolio Standards: Numerous proponents have introduced legislation in the U.S. Congress that would require electric utilities to obtain a specified percentage of their electricity from renewable sources, commonly referred to as a \"renewable portfolio standard\" or \"RPS.\" However, as of the date of this report no federal or State of Idaho RPS is in effect. Idaho Power will be required to comply with a five- or ten-percent RPS in Oregon beginning in 2025 (depending on loads at that time), and Idaho Power expects to meet either RPS requirement with Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) obtained from the purchase of power from the Elkhorn Valley wind project.\nPursuant to an IPUC order, Idaho Power is selling its near-term RECs and returning to customers their share (shared 95% with customers in the Idaho jurisdiction) of those proceeds through the PCA. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, Idaho Power's REC sales totaled $1.0 million, $1.8 million, and $3.2 million, respectively. The comparative decrease in REC sales resulted primarily from the elimination of a REC purchase and sale agreement with a third party.\nWere Idaho Power to be subject to additional RPS legislation, it may cease in full or in part the sale of RECs it receives, seek to obtain RECs from additional projects, generate RECs from any REC-generating facilities it owns or may be required to construct in light of an RPS, or purchase RECs in the market. Historically, Idaho Power has generally not received the RECs associated with PURPA projects. However, an order issued by the IPUC in December 2012, described below, provides that Idaho Power will own a portion of the RECs generated by some PURPA projects. The required purchase of additional RECs to meet RPS requirements would increase Idaho Power's costs, which Idaho Power expects would be wholly or largely passed on to customers through rates and the power cost adjustment mechanisms.\nRenewable and Other Energy Contracts: Idaho Power has contracts for the purchase of power from both CSPP projects under PURPA and non-CSPP renewable generation sources such as biomass, wind, solar, small hydroelectric projects, and two geothermal projects. Idaho Power purchases wind power from both CSPP and non-CSPP facilities, including its largest non-CSPP wind power project-the Elkhorn Valley wind project with a 101-MW nameplate capacity. As of December 31, 2016, Idaho Power had contracts to purchase energy from 117 on-line CSPP projects, twelve additional projects expected to come on-line in 2017, and three projects expected to come on-line in 2019. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016, the resource type and nameplate capacity of Idaho Power's signed CSPP and non-CSPP related agreements. These agreements have original contract terms ranging from one to 35 years.\n\nAll but three of the projects not yet on-line are expected to be on-line no later than mid-year 2017 (three solar projects are scheduled to be on-line in 2019).\nIn April 2015, Idaho Power made filings with the OPUC requesting, among other things, a reduction in the term of standard PURPA power purchase agreements from 20 years to two years for projects above 100 kW, in a manner consistent with its Idaho jurisdiction where the IPUC reduced the length of PURPA contracts that involve avoided-cost-based pricing to two years, and a temporary suspension of Idaho Power's obligation to enter into new fixed-price standard PURPA agreements during the pendency of the proceedings. In March 2016, the OPUC issued an order permanently reducing the eligibility cap for solar project standard contracts to 3 MW, with all other resource types retaining an eligibility cap of 10 MW. In its order, the OPUC retained the requirement for up to 20-year contract lengths for Oregon jurisdictional projects, comprised of 15 years of fixed prices and five years of market index prices.\nIn June 2016, the FERC held a technical conference on implementation issues under PURPA, including the mandatory power purchase obligation and the methods for determining avoided costs for those purchases. The conference also involved a discussion of PURPA project siting issues and minimum contract term lengths. In September 2016, the FERC filed a notice inviting post-technical conference comments on (1) the use of the \"one-mile rule\" to determine the size of an entity seeking certification as a small power production qualifying facility and (2) minimum standards for PURPA-purchase contracts. In November 2016, Idaho Power provided comments to the FERC specifically addressing Idaho Power's position regarding the two items of which the FERC invited comments. Idaho Power is unable to predict what policy or rulemaking actions or proceedings, if any, on PURPA-related issues will result from the technical conference.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nOverview\nIdaho Power is subject to a broad range of federal, state, regional, and local laws and regulations designed to protect, restore, and enhance the environment, including the CAA, the CWA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and the ESA, among other laws. These laws are administered by a number of federal, state, and local agencies. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and associated costs, these laws and regulations provide authority to regulators to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, injunctive relief, and other sanctions. Idaho Power's three co-owned coal-fired power plants and three natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants are subject to many of these regulations. Idaho Power's 17 hydroelectric projects are also further subject to a number of water discharge standards and other environmental requirements.\nCompliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may:\n \u2022 increase the operating costs of generating plants; \n \u2022 increase the construction costs and lead time for new facilities; \n \u2022 require the modification of existing generating plants, which could result in additional costs; \n \u2022 require the curtailment or shut-down of existing generating plants; or \n \u2022 reduce the output from current generating facilities. \nCurrent and future environmental laws and regulations will increase the cost of operating fossil fuel-fired generation plants and constructing new generation and transmission facilities, in large part through the substantial cost of permitting activities and the required installation of additional pollution control devices. In many parts of the United States, some higher-cost, high-emission coal-fired plants have ceased operation or the plant owners have announced a near-term cessation of operation, as the cost of compliance makes the plants uneconomical to operate. The decision to agree to cease operation of the Boardman coal-fired plant, in which Idaho Power owns a 10 percent interest, by the end of 2020, was based in part on the significant future cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Idaho Power filed an application with the IPUC and OPUC in October and November 2016, respectively, requesting accelerated depreciation of the North Valmy plant in connection with the potential early closure of the plant. Additionally, in light of the uncertainty resulting from pending environmental regulation and the substantial estimated cost of SCR controls, Idaho Power is assessing whether to move forward with the installation of SCR on units 1 and 2 at the Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant.\nIn addition to increasing costs generally, these environmental laws and regulations could affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition if the costs associated with these environmental requirements and early plant retirements cannot be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis. Part I, Item 1 - Business - Utility Operations - Environmental Regulation and Costs\u201d in this report includes a summary of Idaho Power's expected capital and operating expenditures for environmental matters during the period from 2017 to 2019. Given the uncertainty of future environmental regulations and technological advances, Idaho Power is unable to predict its environmental-related expenditures beyond 2019, though they could be substantial. Furthermore, the recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation, and government policy regarding environmental matters. Idaho Power may delay making operational changes or environmental-related expenditures while such changes are pending to avoid implementing uncertain laws, rules, and policies.\nEndangered Species Act Matters\nOverview: The listing of a species of fish, wildlife, or plants as threatened or endangered under the ESA may have an adverse impact on Idaho Power's ability to construct generation, transmission, or distribution facilities or relicense or operate its hydroelectric facilities. When a species is added to the federal list of threatened and endangered species, it is protected from take,\u201d which is defined to include harming the species. The ESA directs that, concurrent with a designation of a threatened or endangered species, and where prudent and determinable, the applicable agencies also designate any habitat of such species which is then considered to be critical habitat.\u201d The ESA also provides that each federal agency must ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat. If an action is determined to result in adverse modification of critical habitat, the federal agency must adopt changes to the proposed action to avoid the adverse modification. These changes are often quite extensive and can affect the size, scope, and even the feasibility of a project moving forward. In February 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the NMFS issued a set of regulatory and policy changes relating to critical habitat and adverse modification determinations under the ESA. While the ultimate impact of implementation of those changes is yet to be determined, taken as a whole, Idaho Power believes that the changes could result in the applicable agencies having greater authority in making designations of critical habitat and could increase the likelihood of adverse modification determinations.\nThe construction of generation, transmission, or distribution facilities and the relicensing of Idaho Power's hydroelectric projects can be federally authorized actions that fall under the ESA. There are a number of threatened or endangered species within Idaho Power's service area and within or near proposed transmission line routes, including the slickspot peppergrass. Further, there are a number of ESA-listed fish and other aquatic species located in waterways in which Idaho Power has hydroelectric facilities, including fall Chinook salmon, bull trout, Bliss Rapids snail, and Snake River physa snail. To date, efforts to protect these and other listed species have not significantly affected generation levels or operating costs at any of Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities. However, the ongoing relicensing of the HCC presents endangered species and fisheries issues that may require operational adjustments and could adversely impact the amount of output from hydroelectric dams, potentially causing Idaho Power to rely on more expensive sources for power generation or market purchases.\nDevelopments in Regulation of Sage Grouse Habitat: In February 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of Idaho challenging the BLM's sage grouse resource management and land use plan revisions that became effective in 2015 under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The lawsuit challenges the plans and associated environmental impact statements across the sage grouse range and alleges that the plans fail to ensure that sage grouse populations and habitats will be protected and restored in accordance with the best available science and legal mandates. Further, the complaint challenges certain exemptions provided for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects. Idaho Power has intervened in the proceedings in an effort to support the exemptions provided for in the BLM's plans.\nIn May 2016, a separate lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of North Dakota, challenging the BLM's sage grouse resource management and land use plan revisions, including the exemptions provided for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects. In October 2016, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to no longer challenge the exemptions; however, in December 2016, the North Dakota court transfered claims challenging certain Idaho land use plan amendments to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. As of the date of this report, Idaho Power is participating in the proceedings in an effort to protect its interests.\nESA Issues Related to Specific Projects:\nHells Canyon Relicensing Project: In 2007, the FERC requested initiation of formal consultation under the ESA with the NMFS and the USFWS regarding potential effects of HCC relicensing on several listed aquatic and terrestrial species. Formal consultation has yet to be initiated and the NMFS and the USFWS continue to gather and consider information relative to the effects of relicensing on relevant ESA listed species. Idaho Power continues to cooperate with the USFWS, the NMFS, and the FERC in an effort to address ESA concerns. In December 2004, Idaho Power and eleven other parties, including NMFS and the USFWS, entered into an interim agreement that addresses the effects of the ongoing operations of the HCC on ESA listed species pending the relicensing of the project. At the conclusion of formal consultation and with the issuance of biological opinions by the NMFS and the USFWS and an operating license by the FERC, Idaho Power may be required to implement additional measures or further modify or adjust operations to comply with Section 7 of the ESA. The issuance of a final biological opinion during 2017 is unlikely.\nBoardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West Transmission Projects: In August 2016, the USFWS re-instated the threatened species status of slickspot peppergrass. Most of the species are located on federal land. Idaho Power expects the listing of the slickspot peppergrass and its existence within or near the proposed routes for the Boardman-to-Hemingway and Gateway West transmission line projects to continue to impact the cost and timing of permitting and construction of the projects, as it requires an ESA Section 7 consultation. The USFWS has also indicated it intends to designate critical habitat for the species. If critical habitat is designated within the vicinity of the transmission line projects, Idaho Power expects that the designation could increase the cost of obtaining permits for the projects and could further delay the in-service date of the projects.\nEndangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act Developments: In May 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon issued an opinion finding that in the context of hydroelectric facilities owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and located on the lower Snake River, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) violated the ESA by using improper standards, failing to consider adequately the impact of climate change on habitat conditions, and placing undue reliance on unproven, future federal habitat conservation measures, particularly to the degree that the success of the measures could be undermined by climate change. The court also found that other federal agencies violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by failing to prepare a comprehensive environmental impact statement on implementation of the conservation measures ordered by NOAA Fisheries, including analysis of the measures directed by NOAA Fisheries and other reasonable alternatives. The court's opinion and its emphasis on a climate change-driven analysis element, if generalized to other situations, could require ESA-driven avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation efforts to incorporate surplus measures to ensure species' protection, which could result in considerable increases in cost beyond the cost of additional analysis in the NEPA process. In September 2016, federal agencies initiated an environmental impact statement process to examine hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake River, which Idaho Power expects will take place over a five-year period. None of Idaho Power's hydroelectric facilities are included in the studies.\nClimate Change and the Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nOverview: Long-term climate change could significantly affect Idaho Power's business in a variety of ways, including:\n \u2022 changes in temperature and precipitation could affect customer demand and energy loads; \n \u2022 extreme weather events could increase service interruptions, outages, maintenance costs, and the need for additional backup systems, and can affect the supply of, and demand for, electricity and natural gas, which may impact the price of those and other commodities; \n \u2022 changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows could adversely affect hydroelectric generation; \n \u2022 legislative and/or regulatory developments related to climate change could affect plants and operations, including restrictions on the construction of new generation resources, the expansion of existing resources, or the operation of generation resources; and \n \u2022 consumer preference for, and resource planning decisions requiring, renewable or low GHG-emitting sources of energy could impact usage of existing generation sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission infrastructure. \nFederal and state regulations pertaining to GHG emissions under the CAA have raised uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels, most notably coal, as an economical energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities because many new technologies for reducing CO2 emissions from coal, including carbon capture and storage, are still in the development stage and are not yet proven. Stringent emissions standards could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, which may accelerate the retirement of coal-fired units and create power system reliability issues. Some higher-cost, high-emission coal-fired plants have ceased operation or the plant owners have announced a near-term cessation of operation, as the cost of compliance makes the plants uneconomical to operate, particularly in light of continued low natural gas prices that decrease the cost to operate natural gas-fired power plants.\nA variety of factors contribute to the financial, regulatory, and logistical uncertainties related to GHG reductions. These include the specific GHG emissions limits imposed, the timing of implementation of these limits, the level of emissions allowances allocated and the level that must be purchased, the purchase price of emissions allowances, the development and commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions, the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance, provisions for cost containment (if any), the impact on coal and natural gas prices, and the timing and amount of cost recovery through rates. Accordingly, Idaho Power cannot predict the effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of any GHG emission or other climate change requirements that may be adopted, although the costs to implement and comply with any such requirements could be substantial. A more detailed discussion of legislative and regulatory developments related to climate change follows.\nNational GHG Initiatives; Final Rule Under CAA Section 111(d): The EPA has become increasingly active in the regulation of GHGs. The EPA's endangerment finding in 2009 that GHGs threaten public health and welfare resulted in the enactment of a series of EPA regulations to address GHG emissions.\nIn May 2010, the EPA issued the Tailoring Rule,\u201d which set thresholds for GHG emissions that define when permits are required for new and existing industrial facilities. The final rule tailors\u201d the requirements of these CAA permitting programs to limit which facilities will be required to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permits. The rules require the use of \"best available control technology\" for GHG emissions if a new major source or modification of an existing major source is projected to result in GHG emissions of at least 75,000 tons per year (CO2 equivalent). In addition, Title V permit renewals or modifications for existing major sources must include applicable requirements relating to GHGs. While the rules are complex, Idaho Power believes that its owned and co-owned fossil fuel-fired generation plants are, as of the date of this report, in compliance with the GHG Tailoring Rule.\nIn June 2014, the EPA released, under Section 111(d) of the CAA, a proposed rule for addressing GHG from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs). The proposed rule was intended to achieve a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from the power sector by 2030. On August 3, 2015, the EPA released the final rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA, referred to as the Clean Power Plan, which requires states to adopt plans to collectively reduce 2005 levels of power sector CO2 emissions by 32 percent by the year 2030. The final rule provides states until September 2018 to submit implementation plans, phasing in several compliance periods beginning in 2022 and achieving the final emissions goals by 2030.\nOn February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order staying the implementation of the rule pending the completion of certain legal challenges, which has an uncertain impact on the ultimate timeline for implementation of the rule. Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generation facilities are in the states of Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming. Despite the current stay on implementation, Idaho Power is working with state representatives, neighboring utilities, and others as it analyzes the rule and prepares for compliance. Because the rule is premised on state implementation plans, the terms of which Idaho Power does not control, and due to the potential changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy with respect to environmental matters as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional elections, as of the date of this report Idaho Power is unable to determine the financial or operational impacts of the final rule.\nState GHG Initiatives and Idaho Power's Voluntary GHG Reduction Initiative: In August 2007, the Oregon legislature enacted legislation setting goals of reducing GHG levels to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 75 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Oregon imposes GHG emission reporting requirements on facilities emitting 2,500 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent annually. The Boardman coal-fired power plant located in Oregon, in which Idaho Power is a 10-percent owner, is subject to and in compliance with Oregon's GHG reporting requirements but is scheduled to cease coal-fired operations in 2020.\nIn Oregon, legislation referred to as the Oregon Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Plan was enacted in March 2016, and may require certain large Oregon utilities to remove coal-fired generation from their Oregon retail rates by 2030. Oregon utilities would be permitted to sell the output of coal-fired plants into the wholesale market or reallocate such plants to other states. To the extent Idaho Power is subject to the legislation, it plans to seek recovery, through the ratemaking process, of operating and capitalized costs related to its coal-fired generation assets and removal of any of those assets from Oregon rate base.\nThe State of Idaho has not passed legislation specifically regulating GHGs, but in May 2007, Idaho's governor issued Executive Order 2007-05, which directed the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to work with the state government to implement GHG reductions within each agency, complete a statewide emissions inventory, and provide recommendations to the governor, among other tasks. Wyoming and Nevada similarly have not enacted legislation to regulate GHG emissions and do not have a reporting requirement, but they are members of the Climate Registry, a national, voluntary GHG emission reporting system. The Climate Registry is a collaboration aimed at developing and managing a common GHG emission reporting system across states, provinces, and tribes to track GHG emissions nationally. All states for which Idaho Power has traditional fuel generating plants (i.e. Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming, and Nevada) are members of the Climate Registry. Idaho Power is engaged in voluntary GHG emissions intensity reduction efforts, which is discussed in Part I, Item 1 - Business - Utility Operations - Environmental Regulation and Costs.\"\nClean Air Act Matters\nOverview: In addition to the CAA developments related to GHG emissions described above, several other regulatory programs developed under the CAA apply to Idaho Power. These include the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), New Source Review / Prevention of Significant Deterioration (NSR/PSD)\nRules, and the Regional Haze Rule.\nMATS Implementation: The final MATS rule under the CAA, previously referred to as the Utility MACT Rule, was issued in February 2012. The final rule established emission limits for hazardous air pollutants from new and existing coal-fired and oil-fired steam electric generating units. The MATS rule provided that sources must be in compliance with emission limits by April 2015. Idaho Power and the plant co-owners have installed mercury continuous emission monitoring systems on all of the coal-fired units at the Jim Bridger, Boardman, and North Valmy coal-fired generating plants, along with control technology to reduce mercury, acid gases, and particulate matter emissions for purposes of compliance with the MATS rule. Idaho Power believes that as of the date of this report, the coal-fired plants are in compliance with the MATS rule. Legal challenges relating to the MATS rule, to which Idaho Power is not a party and pursuant to which the EPA is performing a court-mandated cost analysis for the rule, are pending.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards: The CAA requires the EPA to set ambient air quality standards for six \"criteria\" pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. These six pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. States are then required to develop emission reduction strategies through State Implementation Plans, or SIPs, based on attainment of these ambient air quality standards. Recent developments and pending actions related to certain of those items relevant to Idaho Power include the following:\n \u2022 NOx: In 2010, the EPA adopted a new NAAQS for NOx at a level of 100 parts per billion averaged over a 1-hour period. In connection with the new NAAQS, in February 2012 the EPA issued a final rule designating all of the counties in Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming where Idaho Power owns or has an interest in a natural gas or coal-fired power plant as unclassifiable/attainment\u201d for NOx. The EPA indicated it would review the designations after 2015, when three years of air quality monitoring data are available, and may formally designate the counties as attainment or non-attainment for NOx. A designation of non-attainment may increase the likelihood that Idaho Power would be required to install costly pollution control technology at one or more of its plants. \n \u2022 SO2: In 2010, the EPA adopted a new NAAQS for SO2 at a level of 75 parts per billion averaged over a one-hour period. In 2011, the states of Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming sent letters to the EPA recommending that all counties in these states be classified as \"unclassifiable\" under the new one-hour SO2 NAAQS because of a lack of definitive monitoring and modeling data. In February 2013, the EPA issued letters to the states of Idaho and Oregon, finding that the most recent air quality data for those states showed no violations of the 2010 SO2 standard. As a result, the EPA is waiting to propose designation actions for those states, and is likely to proceed with designation actions once additional data is gathered. Idaho Power expects that designations for Nevada and Wyoming will also be addressed in a separate future action. \n \u2022 Ozone: In late 2014, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would update the ozone standard under the CAA, from 75 parts per billion over an eight-hour period to 65 to 70 parts per billion over an eight-hour period. On October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the national ozone standard under the CAA to 70 parts per billion. The EPA stated that the vast majority of U.S. counties will meet the standards by 2025 with federal and state rules and programs now in place or underway. The EPA's plan provides for finalizing non-attainment designations in 2017, and it plans to propose rules and guidance over the next year to help states with potential non-attainment areas implement the revised standards. Non-attainment areas will have until 2020 to late 2037 to meet the new standard, with attainment dates varying based on the ozone level in the area. Due to high levels of background ozone, which can be caused by factors such as elevation, vegetation, wildfire, and international transport, attainment in areas within the Intermountain West may be difficult, and the formulation of state implementation plans to bring an area into compliance with the new standard may be challenging due to the existence of ozone caused by factors outside of local control. If the EPA were to make non-attainment determinations in areas where Idaho Power owns or co-owns power plants, or proposes to construct power plants, the state implementation plan for those areas could result in changes to the nature and frequency of operation of existing generation plants and make more difficult or costly the construction of new power generation plants. Idaho Power will seek to work with state regulators on implementation plans for any non-attainment areas, in an effort to reduce the potential adverse impact on Idaho Power's operation of its existing power generation plants and construction of future facilities. \nBecause the EPA has not yet completed the designation of areas as attaining or not attaining the NAAQS for NOx, SO2, and ozone, Idaho Power is unable to predict what impact the adoption and implementation of these standards may have on its operations, though it does expect at least some increases in capital and operating costs from the standards if areas in which Idaho Power operate, or adjacent areas, receive non-attainment designations.\nRegional Haze Rules: In accordance with federal regional haze rules under the CAA, coal-fired utility boilers are subject to regional haze - best available retrofit technology (RH BART) if they were built between 1962 and 1977 and affect any \"Class I\" (wilderness) areas. This includes all four units at the Jim Bridger and the Boardman coal-fired plants. The RH BART rules would have required installation of a suite of emissions controls at the Boardman plant; however, in December 2010, the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission approved a plan to install a less costly suite of environmental controls and cease coal-fired operations at the Boardman power plant no later than December 31, 2020.\nIn December 2009, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) issued a RH BART permit to PacifiCorp as the operator of the Jim Bridger plant. As part of the WDEQ's long term strategy for regional haze, the permit required that PacifiCorp install SCR equipment for NOx control at Jim Bridger units 3 and 4 by December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which has been completed, and submit an application by December 31, 2017 to install add-on NOx controls at Jim Bridger unit 2 by 2021 and unit 1 by 2022. In November 2010, PacifiCorp and the WDEQ signed a settlement agreement under\nwhich PacifiCorp agreed to the timing and nature of the controls. The settlement agreement was conditioned on the EPA ultimately approving those portions of the Wyoming regional haze SIP that are consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. In January 2014, the EPA approved Wyoming's regional haze SIP as to the Jim Bridger plant, with the NOx control compliance dates set forth in the settlement agreement. Several interested parties have appealed the EPA's decisions on Wyoming's regional haze SIP on various grounds. Idaho Power has not appealed the EPA's decisions but has intervened in the proceedings to participate if and to the extent the Jim Bridger plant could be affected.\nClean Water Act Matters\nDefinition of Waters of the United States\u201d Under the CWA: On August 28, 2015, the EPA's and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' final rule defining the phrase \"waters of the United States\" under the CWA became effective. Idaho Power believes that the final rule potentially expands federal jurisdiction under the CWA beyond traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, territorial seas, tributaries, and adjacent wetlands, to a number of other waters, including waters with a \"significant nexus\" to those traditional waters. As a result of the potential expansion, the final rule may result in additional permitting and regulatory requirements under multiple provisions of the CWA. Idaho Power has analyzed the final rule and expects that while it may incur additional permitting and other costs associated with the rule, the aggregate amount of increased costs is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition, in part due to the relatively arid climate of Idaho Power's service area and the existing application of the CWA to most of Idaho Power's facilities, including its hydroelectric plants.\nIn October 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay of the final waters of the United States rule from becoming effective. In response to the Sixth Circuit's decision, the EPA resumed nationwide use of the agency's prior regulations defining the term waters of the United States.\u201d The EPA stated that those regulations will be implemented as they were prior to August 27, 2015, by applying relevant case law, applicable policy, and the best science and technical data on a case-by-case basis in determining which waters are protected by the CWA.\nCWA Matters Related to Hydroelectric Relicensing: Idaho Power is also addressing CWA issues associated with the relicensing of its HCC. See Relicensing of Hydroelectric Projects\u201d in this MD&A for additional information on the impact of the CWA on that relicensing effort.\nReview of Federal Coal Leases\nIn January 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced that it would launch a comprehensive review to identify and evaluate potential reforms to the federal coal lease program. The review is intended to address questions such as how, when, and where to lease coal resources, how to account for the environmental and public health impacts of federal coal production, and how to ensure taxpayers are earning a fair return for the use of the coal resources. The U.S. Department of the Interior stated that it will not issue new coal leases during the pendency of the review, except under limited circumstances, but mining under existing leases will not be suspended during the review. BCC, which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant, currently leases its coal under federal, state, and private coal leases. It is uncertain how new federal lease applications will be handled during the U.S. Department of the Interior's coal lease review. Idaho Power believes that BCC has adequate reserves under existing leases to satisfy its coal delivery obligations to the Jim Bridger plant during the term of the existing coal supply contract through 2024, and that the Jim Bridger plant will otherwise have access to sufficient coal supplies for its operation for the foreseeable future. However, depending on the outcome of the Department of the Interior's review, the availability of coal resources could decline and the cost of leases for coal resources could increase, which could increase the fuel cost for each of Idaho Power's co-owned coal-fired plants.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWhen preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's management must apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates often involve judgment about factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management's control. Management adjusts these estimates based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual amounts could materially differ from the estimates. Management believes the accounting policies and estimates discussed below are the most critical to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.\nAccounting for Rate Regulation\nEntities that meet specific conditions are required by GAAP to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized. Similarly, certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities. Idaho Power must satisfy three conditions to apply regulatory accounting: (1) an independent regulator must set rates; (2) the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service; and (3) the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator.\nIdaho Power has determined that it meets these conditions, and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate-making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating Idaho Power. The primary effect of this policy is that Idaho Power had recorded $1.5 billion of regulatory assets and $447 million of regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2016. Idaho Power expects to recover these regulatory assets from customers through rates and refund these regulatory liabilities to customers through rates, but recovery or refund is subject to final review by the regulatory bodies. If future recovery or refund of these amounts ceases to be probable, or if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate those regulatory assets or liabilities. Either circumstance could have a material effect on Idaho Power's financial condition or results of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nIDACORP and Idaho Power use judgment and estimation in developing the provision for income taxes and the reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws can involve uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret such laws differently. Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts and may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income, cash flows, and tax-related assets and liabilities.\nIdaho Power provides deferred income taxes related to its plant assets for the difference between income tax depreciation and book depreciation used for financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes for other items are provided for the temporary differences between the income tax and financial accounting treatment of such items. Unless contrary to applicable income tax guidance, deferred income taxes are not provided for those income tax temporary differences where the prescribed regulatory accounting methods, or flow-through, direct Idaho Power to recognize the tax impacts currently for rate making and financial reporting.\nRefer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 2 - Income Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to income taxes.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nIdaho Power maintains a tax-qualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors called the Security Plan for Senior Management Employees (SMSP), and a postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits).\nThe costs IDACORP and Idaho Power record for these plans depend on the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, actual returns on plan assets, and several assumptions used in the actuarial valuations from which the expense is derived. The key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future stock market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors used to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates.\nThe assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high-quality corporate debt. Specifically, IDACORP and Idaho Power determined the discount rate for each plan through the construction of hypothetical portfolios of bonds selected from high-quality corporate bonds available as of December 31, 2016, with maturities matching the projected cash outflows of the plans. Based on the results of this analysis, the discount rate used to calculate the 2017 pension expense will be decreased to 4.45 percent from the 4.60 percent used in 2016.\nRate-of-return projections for plan assets are based on historical risk/return relationships among asset classes. The primary measure is the historical risk premium each asset class has delivered versus the yield on the Moody's AA Corporate Bond Index. This historical risk premium is then added to the current yield on the Moody's AA Corporate Bond Index, and Idaho\nPower believes the result provides a reasonable prediction of future investment performance. Additional analysis is performed to measure the expected range of returns, as well as worst-case and best-case scenarios. Based on the current interest rate environment, current rate-of-return expectations are lower than the nominal returns generated over the past 20 years when interest rates were generally much higher. The long-term rate of return used to calculate the 2017 pension expense will be 7.5 percent, the same assumption as was used for 2016.\nGross net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost for these plans totaled $52 million, $51 million, and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, including amounts deferred as regulatory assets (see discussion below) and amounts allocated to capitalized labor. For 2017, gross pension and other postretirement benefit costs are expected to total approximately $51 million, which takes into account the change in the discount rate noted above.\nHad different actuarial assumptions been used, pension expense could have varied significantly. The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in the discount rate and rate-of-return on plan assets actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension and postretirement expense:\n\nAdditionally, a 0.5 percent increase in the plans' discount rates would have resulted in a $74 million decrease in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of December 31, 2016. A 0.5 percent decrease in the plans' discount rates would have resulted in an $83 million increase in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of December 31, 2016.\nThe IPUC has authorized Idaho Power to account for its defined benefit pension plan expense on a cash basis, and to defer and account for accrued pension expense as a regulatory asset. The IPUC acknowledged that it is appropriate for Idaho Power to seek recovery in its revenue requirement of reasonable and prudently incurred pension expense based on actual cash contributions. In 2007, Idaho Power began deferring pension expense to a regulatory asset account to be matched with revenue when future pension contributions are recovered through rates. At December 31, 2016, a total of $105 million of expense was deferred as a regulatory asset. Approximately $23 million is expected to be deferred in 2017. Idaho Power recorded pension expense in 2016, 2015, and 2014 of $19 million, $19 million, and $35 million, respectively.\nRefer to Note 11 - Benefit Plans\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nContingent Liabilities\nAn estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if (a) it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no accrual is recorded but disclosure of the contingency, if material, in the notes to the financial statements is required. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized. IDACORP and Idaho Power have a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory and legal matters. If the recognition criteria have been met, liabilities have been recorded. Estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the financial statements.\nRECENTLY ISSUED
