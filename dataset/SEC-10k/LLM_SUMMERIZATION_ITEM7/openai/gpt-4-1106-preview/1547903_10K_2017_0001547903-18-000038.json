Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included below in Item 8 of this report and the Risk Factors included above in Part I, Item 1A of this report. In addition, investors should review the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" above.\nOverview\nWe provide private MI through our wholly owned insurance subsidiaries NMIC and Re One. NMIC and Re One are domiciled in Wisconsin and principally regulated by the Wisconsin OCI. NMIC is our primary insurance subsidiary, and is approved as an MI provider by the GSEs and is licensed to write coverage in all 50 states and D.C. Re One provides statutorily required reinsurance to NMIC on insured loans with coverage levels in excess of 25% after giving effect to third-party reinsurance. Our subsidiary, NMIS, provides outsourced loan review services to mortgage loan originators.\nMI protects lenders and investors from default-related losses on a portion of the unpaid principal balance of a covered mortgage. MI plays a critical role in the U.S. housing market by mitigating mortgage credit risk and facilitating the secondary market sale of high-LTV (i.e. above 80%) residential loans to the GSEs, who are otherwise restricted by their charters from purchasing or guaranteeing high-LTV mortgages that are not covered by certain credit protections. Such credit protection and secondary market sales allow lenders to increase their capacity for mortgage commitments and expand financing access to existing and prospective homeowners.\nNMIH, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in May 2011, and we began start-up operations in 2012 and wrote our first MI policy in 2013. Since formation, we have sought to establish customer relationships with a broad group of mortgage lenders and build a diversified, high-quality insured portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, we had master policies with 1,267 customers, including national and regional mortgage banks, money center banks, credit unions, community banks, builder-owned mortgage lenders, internet-sourced lenders and other non-bank lenders. We had total IIF of $51.7 billion and gross RIF of $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to total IIF of $35.8 billion and gross RIF of $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2016, and total IIF of $19.1 billion and gross RIF of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2015. Included in our total IIF as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $48.5 billion, $32.2 billion and $14.8 billion of primary IIF, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, our gross primary RIF was $11.8 billion, compared to $7.8 billion and $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated NIW of $21.6 billion, compared to $21.2 billion and $12.4 billion for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had 299 full-time employees.\nWe believe that our success in acquiring a large and diverse group of lender customers and growing a portfolio of high-quality IIF traces to our founding principles, whereby we aim to help qualified individuals achieve the dream of homeownership, ensure that we remain a strong and credible counterparty, deliver a unique customer service experience, establish a differentiated risk management approach that emphasizes the individual underwriting review or validation of the vast majority of the loans we insure, and foster a culture of collaboration and excellence that helps us attract and retain experienced industry leaders.\nOur strategy is to continue to build on our position in the private MI market, expand our customer base and grow our insured portfolio of high-quality residential loans by focusing on long-term customer relationships, disciplined and proactive risk selection and pricing, fair and transparent claims payment practices, responsive customer service, financial strength and profitability.\nOur common stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol \"NMIH.\"\nWe discuss below our results of operations for the periods presented, as well as the conditions and trends that have impacted or are expected to impact our business, including customer development, new business writings, the composition of our insurance portfolio and other factors that we expect to impact our results.\nConditions and Trends Impacting Our Business\nCustomer Development\nWe have important relationships with customers across all categories and allocation profiles, including National Accounts and Regional Accounts, and centralized and decentralized lenders. Our sales and marketing efforts are broadly focused on expanding our presence with existing customers and activating new customer relationships. We consider an activation to be the point at which we have signed a Master Policy, established IT connectivity and generated a first application or first NIW from a customer. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we activated 127 lenders, compared to 173 and 247 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also continued to expand our business with existing customers, deepening our existing relationships and capturing what we believe to be an increasing portion of their annual MI volume. At December 31, 2017, we had 1,267 Master Policies and 841 active customer relationships, compared to 1,131 and 715 as of December 31, 2016 and 964 and 524 as of December 31, 2015.\nNew Insurance Written, Insurance In Force and Risk In Force\nNIW is the aggregate unpaid principal balance of mortgages underpinning new policies written during a given period. Our NIW is affected by the overall size of the mortgage origination market and the volume of high-LTV mortgage originations, which tend to be generated to a greater extent in purchase originations as compared to refinancings. Our NIW is also affected by the percentage of such high-LTV originations covered by private versus public MI or other alternative credit enhancement structures and our share of the private MI market. NIW, together with persistency, drives our IIF. IIF is the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the mortgages we insure, as reported to us by servicers at a given date, and represents the sum total of NIW from all prior periods less principal payments on insured mortgages and policy cancellations (including for prepayment, nonpayment of premiums, coverage rescission and claim payments). RIF is related to IIF and represents the aggregate amount of coverage we provide on all outstanding policies at a given date. RIF is calculated as the sum total of the coverage percentage of each individual policy in our portfolio applied to the unpaid principal balance of such insured mortgage. RIF is affected by IIF and the LTV profile of our insured mortgages, with lower LTV loans generally having a lower coverage percentage and higher LTV loans having a higher coverage percentage. Gross RIF represents RIF before consideration of reinsurance. Net RIF is gross RIF net of ceded reinsurance.\nNet Premiums Written and Net Premiums Earned\nWe set our premium rates on individual policies based on the risk characteristics of the underlying mortgage loans and borrowers, and in accordance with our filed rates and applicable rating rules.\nPremiums are generally fixed over the estimated life of the underlying loans. Net premiums written are equal to gross premiums written minus ceded premiums written under our reinsurance arrangements and less premium refunds. As a result, net premiums written are generally influenced by:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NIW;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>premium rates and the mix of premium payment type, which are either single, monthly or annual premiums, as described below;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cancellation rates of our insurance policies, which are impacted by payments or prepayments on mortgages, refinancings (which are affected by prevailing mortgage interest rates as compared to interest rates on loans underpinning our in force policies), levels of claims payments and home prices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cession of premiums under third-party reinsurance arrangements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Premiums are paid either by the borrower (BPMI) or the lender (LPMI) in a single payment at origination (single premium), on a monthly installment basis (monthly premium) or on an annual installment basis (annual premium). Our net premiums written will differ from our net premiums earned due to policy payment type. For single premiums, we receive a single premium payment at origination, which is initially recorded as unearned premium and earned over the estimated life of the policy. A majority of our single premium policies in force as of December 31, 2017 were non-refundable under most cancellation scenarios. If non-refundable single premium policies are canceled, we immediately recognize the remaining unearned premium balances as earned premium revenue. Monthly premiums are recognized in the month billed and when the coverage is effective. Annual premiums are earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. Substantially all of our policies provide for either single or monthly premiums.\nThe percentage of IIF that remains on our books after any 12-month period is defined as our persistency rate. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, higher persistency rates can have a significant impact on our net premiums earned and profitability. Generally, faster speeds of mortgage prepayment lead to lower persistency. Prepayment speeds and the relative mix of business between single and monthly premium policies also impact our profitability. Our premium rates include\ncertain assumptions regarding repayment or prepayment speeds of the mortgages underlying our policies. Because premiums are paid at origination on single premium policies and substantially all of our single premium policies are non-refundable on cancellation, assuming all other factors remain constant, if single premium loans are prepaid earlier than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to increase and, if loans are repaid slower than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to decrease. By contrast, if monthly premium loans are repaid earlier than anticipated, we do not earn any more premium with respect to those loans and, unless we replace the repaid monthly premium loan with a new loan, our profitability is likely to decline.\nEffect of reinsurance on our results\nWe utilize third-party reinsurance to actively manage our risk, ensure PMIERs compliance and support the growth of our business. We currently have both quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements in place, which impact our results of operations and regulatory capital and PMIERs asset positions. Under a quota share reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer receives a premium in exchange for covering an agreed-upon portion of incurred losses. Such a quota share arrangement reduces net premiums written and earned and also reduces net RIF, providing capital relief to the ceding insurance company and reducing incurred claims in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement. In addition, reinsurers typically pay ceding commissions as part of quota share transactions, which offset the ceding company's acquisition and underwriting expenses. Certain quota share agreements include profit commissions that are earned based on loss performance and serve to reduce ceded premiums. Under an excess-of-loss agreement, the ceding insurer is typically responsible for losses up to an agreed-upon threshold and the reinsurer then provides coverage in excess of such threshold up to a maximum agreed-upon limit. In general, there are no ceding commissions under excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements. We expect to continue to evaluate reinsurance opportunities in the normal course of business.\nQuota share reinsurance\nNMIC entered into the 2016 QSR Transaction in September 2016. Under the terms of the 2016 QSR Transaction, NMIC (1) ceded 100% of the risk relating to our pool agreement with Fannie Mae, (2) ceded 25% of existing risk written on eligible policies as of August 31, 2016 and (3) ceded 25% of the risk relating to eligible primary insurance policies written between September 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claims expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 60% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.\nNMIC entered into the 2018 QSR Transaction, which took effect January 1, 2018. Under the 2018 QSR Transaction, NMIC agrees to cede 25% of its eligible policies written in 2018 and 20% to 30% (such amount to be determined by NMIC at its sole election by December 1, 2018) of eligible policies written in 2019, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claims expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 61% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.\nExcess-of-loss reinsurance\nIn May 2017, NMIC secured $211.3 million of aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage at inception for an existing portfolio of MI policies written from 2013 through December 31, 2016, through a mortgage insurance-linked notes offering by Oaktown Re. The reinsurance coverage amount under the terms of the 2017 ILN Transaction decreases from $211.3 million at inception over a ten-year period as the underlying covered mortgages amortize and/or are repaid, and was $177 million as of December 31, 2017. For the reinsurance coverage period, NMIC will retain the first layer of $126.8 million of aggregate losses and Oaktown Re will then provide a second layer of coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. NMIC retains losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount.\nSee, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6, Reinsurance\" for further discussion of these third-party reinsurance arrangements.\nPortfolio Data\nThe following table presents primary and pool NIW and IIF as of the dates and for the periods indicated.

Primary NIW increased 71% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily because of the growth within and an expansion of our customer base.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, 81% of our NIW related to monthly premium policies, as compared to 67% and 48% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, monthly premium policies accounted for 69% of our primary IIF, as compared to 60% at December 31, 2016 and 47% at December 31, 2015. We expect the break-down of monthly premium policies and single premium policies (which we refer to as \"mix\") in our primary IIF to continue to trend toward our current NIW mix over time. Our total IIF at December 31, 2017 increased 44% compared to December 31, 2016, which in turn increased 88% compared to December 31, 2015, primarily because of the NIW we generated between such measurement dates and higher persistency of our policies in force.\nThe following table presents net premiums written and earned for the periods indicated.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary and pool premiums written and earned\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned (1)\n</td> <td>165,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Net premiums written and earned are reported net of reinsurance and premium refunds.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net premiums written and earned increased 29% and 50%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net premiums written is due to the growth of our IIF and increased monthly policy production, partially offset by a decrease in single premium NIW. The trend in net premiums written was also impacted by the inception of the 2016 QSR Transaction in September 2016, which entailed an initial cession of $35 million of premiums written on all covered singles policies written prior to the transaction effective date and had the effect of reducing net premiums written in 2016 by a like amount. The increase in net premiums earned is due to the growth of our IIF and increased monthly policy production, partially offset by decreases in our single premium NIW and earnings from cancellations, and the impact of cessions under the 2017 ILN transaction and 2016 QSR Transaction.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net premiums written and earned increased 18% and 143%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increases in net premiums written and earned are primarily due to the growth of our IIF and increased NIW production, partially offset by ceded premiums related to the 2016 QSR Transaction, which entailed an initial cession of premiums written on all covered singles policies written prior to the transaction effective date and introduced partial cessions of premiums written and earned on covered policies thereafter.\nPool premiums written and earned for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, were $3.8 million, $4.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively, before giving effect to the 2016 QSR Transaction, under which all of our written and earned pool premiums have been ceded.\nPortfolio Statistics\nUnless otherwise noted, the portfolio statistics tables presented below do not include the effects of our third-party reinsurance arrangements described above.

In general, the majority of underwriting profit, calculated as earned premium revenue minus claims and underwriting and operating expenses, generated by a particular book year emerges in the years immediately following origination. This pattern generally occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years following origination, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments), and by increasing losses.\nThe table below reflects a summary of our primary IIF and RIF by book year as of the dates indicated.\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary IIF and RIF\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>IIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RIF\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>18,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>8,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>1,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe utilize certain risk principles that form the basis of how we underwrite and originate primary NIW. We manage our portfolio credit risk by using several loan eligibility matrices which prescribe the maximum LTV, minimum borrower FICO score, maximum borrower DTI ratio, maximum loan size, property type, loan type, loan term and occupancy status of loans that we will insure. Our loan eligibility matrices, as well as all of our detailed underwriting guidelines, are contained in our Underwriting Guideline Manual that is publicly available on our website. Our eligibility criteria and underwriting guidelines are designed to mitigate the layered risk inherent in a single insurance policy. \"Layered risk\" refers to the accumulation of borrower, loan and property risk. For example, we have higher credit score and lower maximum allowed LTV requirements for investor-owned properties, compared to owner-occupied properties. We monitor the concentrations of various risk attributes in our insurance portfolio, which may change over time, in part, as a result of regional conditions or public policy shifts.\nThe tables below present our primary NIW by FICO, LTV and purchase/refinance mix for the periods indicated. We calculate the LTV of a loan as the percentage of the original loan amount to the original purchase value of the property securing the loan.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

We also make estimates of IBNR defaults, which are defaults that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, based on historical reporting trends, and establish IBNR reserves for those estimates. We also establish reserves for unallocated claims expenses not associated with a specific claim. The claims expenses consist of the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees as well as other general expenses of administering the claims settlement process.\nReserves are established by estimating the number of loans in default that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as claim frequency, and the amount of the claim payment expected to be paid on each such loan in default, which is referred to as\nclaim severity. Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical observed experience regarding certain loan factors, such as age of the default, cure rates, size of the loan and estimated change in property valuation. Reserves are released the month in which a loan in default is brought current by the borrower, which is referred to as a cure. Adjustments to reserve estimates are reflected in the period in which the adjustment is made. Reserves are also ceded to reinsurers under the 2016 QSR Transaction and will be ceded under the 2018 QSR Transaction beginning in 2018. We will not cede reserves to the reinsurer under the 2017 ILN Transaction unless losses exceed our retained coverage layer. Reserves are not established for future claims on insured loans which are not currently in default.\nBased on our experience and industry data, we believe that claims incidence for mortgage insurance is generally highest in the third through sixth years after loan origination. As of December 31, 2017, over 95% of our primary IIF was related to business written since January 1, 2015. Although the claims experience on new primary insurance written by us to date has been favorable, we expect incurred claims to increase as a greater amount of our existing insured portfolio reaches its anticipated period of highest claim frequency. We estimate that the loss ratio over the life of our existing primary insured portfolio will be between 20% and 25% of earned premiums, and we price to that expectation. Additionally, our pool insurance agreement with Fannie Mae contains a claim deductible through which Fannie Mae absorbs specified losses before we are obligated to pay any claims. We have not established any pool reserves for claims or IBNR to date.\nThe actual claims we incur as our portfolio matures are difficult to predict and depend on the specific characteristics of our current in-force book (including the credit score and DTI of the borrower, the LTV ratio of the mortgage and geographic concentrations, among others), as well as the profile of new business we write in the future. In addition, claims experience will be affected by future macroeconomic factors such as housing prices, interest rates and employment and other events, such as natural catastrophes. To date, our claims experience is developing at a slower pace than historical trends indicate, as a result of high quality underwriting, a strong macroeconomic environment and a favorable housing market. For additional discussion of our reserves, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 7, Reserves for Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses.\"\nWe insure mortgages for homes in areas that have been impacted by recent natural disasters, including hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires. We do not provide coverage for property or casualty claims related to physical damage of a home underpinning an insured mortgage. We have experienced an increase in NODs on insured loans in the impacted areas. Our ultimate claims exposure will depend on the number of NODs received, proximate cause of each default and cure rate of the NOD population. In the event of natural disasters, cure rates are influenced by the adequacy of homeowners and other hazard insurance carried on a related property, GSE-sponsored forbearance and other assistance programs, and a borrower's access to aid from government entities and private organizations, in addition to other factors which generally impact cure rates in unaffected areas.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending reserve balances for primary insurance claims and claims expenses.\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less reinsurance recoverables (1)\n</td> <td>(297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning balance, net of reinsurance recoverables\n</td> <td>2,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add claims incurred:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Claims and claim expenses incurred:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current year (2)\n</td> <td>6,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior years (3)\n</td> <td>(801\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total claims and claims expenses incurred\n</td> <td>5,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less claims paid:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Claims and claim expenses paid:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current year (2)\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior years (3)\n</td> <td>1,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total claims and claim expenses paid\n</td> <td>1,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve at end of period, net of reinsurance recoverables\n</td> <td>6,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add reinsurance recoverables (1)\n</td> <td>1,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Related to ceded losses recoverable on the 2016 QSR Transaction, included in \"Other Assets\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For example, if a loan had defaulted in a prior year and subsequently cured and later re-defaulted in the current year, that default would be included in the current year.\n(3) Related to insured loans with defaults occurring in prior years, which have been continuously in default since that time.\nThe \"claims incurred\" section of the table above shows claims and claim expenses incurred on NODs for current and prior years, including IBNR reserves. The amount of claims incurred for current year NODs represents the estimated amount to be ultimately paid on such loans in default. The decreases during the periods presented in reserves held for prior year defaults represent favorable development and are generally the result of NOD cures and ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends. We may increase or decrease our original estimates as we learn additional information about individual defaults and claims, and continue to observe and analyze loss development trends in our portfolio. Gross reserves of $1.0 million related to prior year defaults remained as of December 31, 2017.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending count of loans in default.\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning default inventory\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: new defaults\n</td> <td>1,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: cures\n</td> <td>(486\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: claims paid\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending default inventory\n</td> <td>928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the ending default inventory at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016, was primarily due to new defaults on insured loans in areas impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires, as well as the aging of earlier book years and an increase in the overall number of policies in our portfolio. The increase in the ending default inventory at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 is tied to the growth in the number of policies in force and the expected loss development of our portfolio.\nThe following table provides details of our claims paid, before giving effect to claims ceded under the 2016 QSR Transaction, for the periods indicated.\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ Values In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of claims paid\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total amount paid for claims\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average amount paid per claim\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severity(1)\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Severity represents the total amount of claims paid divided by the related RIF on the loan at the time the claim is perfected.\nThe increase in the number of claims paid for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, is due to an increase in our default inventory. We expect the severity of claims we receive to be between 85% and 95% of the coverage amount for the near-term.\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average reserve per default:\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Case (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IBNR\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Defined as the gross reserve per insured loan in default.\nThe average reserve per default at December 31, 2017 decreased from December 31, 2016 primarily due to new defaults on insured loans in areas impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires. As of December 31, 2017, 533 of the 928 loans in default relate to homes in areas declared by FEMA to be disaster zones following the aforementioned natural disasters. We anticipate that this population of loans in default will cure at a higher rate than the estimated rate we apply to non-disaster related loans in default, due to our Master Policy coverage terms, historical industry experience, and current economic indicators and relief programs. As such, we have established lower reserves for these NODs than we otherwise do for similarly situated NODs in non-disaster zones. Over time, we anticipate that our average reserve per default will revert to our historical averages as the NODs in these zones cure.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our business has been subject to modest seasonality in both NIW production and default experience. Consistent with the seasonality of home sales, purchase origination volumes typically increase in late spring and peak during the summer months, leading to a rise in NIW volume during the second and third quarters of a given year. Refinancing volume, however, does not follow a set seasonal trend and instead is primarily influenced by mortgage rates. An increase in refinancing volume may limit the seasonal effect of home purchase patterns on mortgage insurance NIW. In addition, while macroeconomic factors in any given period may influence default experience to a greater extent than does seasonality, our industry has typically experienced a fourth quarter seasonal increase in the number of defaults and a first quarter seasonal decline in the number of defaults and increase in the number of cures.\nGSE Oversight\nAs an Approved Insurer, NMIC is subject to ongoing compliance with the PMIERs. (Italicized terms have the same meaning that such terms have in the PMIERs, as described below.) The PMIERs establish operational, business, remedial and financial\nrequirements applicable to Approved Insurers. The PMIERs financial requirements prescribe a risk-based methodology whereby the amount of assets required to be held against each insured loan is determined based on certain risk characteristics, such as FICO, vintage (year of origination), performing vs. non-performing (i.e., current vs. delinquent), LTV and other risk features. An asset charge is calculated for each insured loan based on its risk profile. In general, higher quality loans carry lower charges.\nUnder the PMIERs financial requirements, Approved Insurers must maintain available assets that equal or exceed minimum required assets, which is an amount equal to the greater of (i) $400 million or (ii) a total risk-based required asset amount. The risk-based required asset amount is a function of the risk profile of an Approved Insurer's net RIF, calculated by applying on a loan-by-loan basis certain risk-based factors derived from tables set out in the PMIERs to the net RIF, and other transactional adjustments approved by the GSEs, such as with respect to our 2017 ILN Transaction and 2016 QSR Transaction. The risk-based required asset amount for primary insurance is subject to a floor of 5.6% of total, performing, primary RIF, and the risk-based required asset amount for pool insurance considers both the factors in the tables and the net remaining stop loss for each pool insurance policy. The PMIERs financial requirements also increase the amount of available assets that must be held by an Approved Insurer for LPMI policies originated on or after January 1, 2016.\nBy April 15th of each year, NMIC must certify it met all PMIERs requirements as of December 31st of the prior year. As of December 31, 2017, NMIC had sufficient available assets to meet the PMIERs financial requirements, and we expect to certify to the GSEs by April 15, 2018 that NMIC fully complied with the PMIERs as of December 31, 2017. NMIC also has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of its failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements. We continuously monitor our compliance with the PMIERs.\nThe following table provides a comparison of the PMIERs financial requirements as reported by NMIC as of the dates indicated.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ values in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>527,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>453,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Risk-Based Required Assets\n</td> <td>446,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>366,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAvailable assets were $528 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $454 million at December 31, 2016 and $431 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in available assets of $74 million at December 31, 2017 and $23 million at December 31, 2016 was driven by positive cash flow from operations and the amortization of unearned premium reserves during each period. The increase in the risk-based required asset amount at each measurement date is due to the growth of our gross RIF, partially offset by the cession of risk relating to our third-party reinsurance agreements.\nOn December 18, 2017, the GSEs provided us with a confidential summary of the proposed changes to the PMIERs financial, business and other requirements that they are developing with the FHFA. We have engaged in conversations with the FHFA and the GSEs about the proposed changes and expect to continue to provide feedback to them in the coming months. Once changes to the PMIERs requirements are finalized, we expect the industry will be afforded a six month implementation period and currently anticipate that updated PMIERs requirements, if any, will take effect no sooner than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nCybersecurity\nAs a participant in the mortgage lending and MI industries, we rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide and expand our products and services. We have established and implemented security measures, controls and procedures to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed and/or stored in such systems. We periodically employ third parties to evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, controls and procedures. In addition, we have established a business continuity plan that is designed to allow our business to continue to operate in the midst of certain disruptive events, including any disruptions to our information technology systems. We also have an incident response plan that is designed to address information security incidents, including breaches of our information technology systems. Despite these safeguards, disruptions to and breaches of our information technology systems are possible and may negatively impact our business.\nWe maintain cyber errors and omissions coverage to limit our exposure if an incident occurs. This insurance provides coverage for (i) claims related to, among other things, unauthorized network or computer access, unintentional disclosure or misuse of personally identifiable information in our possession, unintentional failure to disclose a breach and (ii) certain costs related to privacy notification, crisis management, cyber extortion, data recovery and business interruption.\nCapital Position of Our Insurance Subsidiaries and Financial Strength Ratings\nIn addition to GSE-imposed asset requirements, NMIC is also subject to state regulatory minimum capital requirements based on its RIF. While formulations of this minimum capital may vary by jurisdiction, the most common measure allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 25:1.\nAs of December 31, 2017, NMIC's performing primary RIF, net of reinsurance, was approximately $7.3 billion. NMIC ceded 100% of its pool RIF pursuant to the 2016 QSR Transaction. Based on NMIC's total statutory capital of $524 million (including contingency reserves) as of December 31, 2017, NMIC's RTC ratio was 14.0:1. Re One had total statutory capital of $34 million as of December 31, 2017, with a RTC ratio of 0.8:1. We continuously monitor our compliance with state capital requirements.\nIn March 2017, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) upgraded its financial strength rating from \"Ba2\" to \"Ba1\" for NMIC. At that time, Moody's also upgraded its rating of NMIH's $150 million Term Loan from \"B2\" to \"B1.\" In August 2017, Moody's re-affirmed its \"Ba1\" financial strength rating for NMIC and its B1 rating of NMIH's $150 million Term Loan and upgraded the outlook for both ratings from \"stable\" to \"positive.\" In July 2017, S&P re-affirmed its \"BBB-\" financial strength and long-term counter-party credit ratings on NMIC and its \"BB-\" long-term counter-party credit rating on NMIH and upgraded the outlook for both ratings to \"positive.\"\nCompetition\nThe MI industry is highly competitive and currently consists of six private mortgage insurers, including NMIC, as well as public MIs like the FHA and the VA. Private MI companies compete based on service, customer relationships, underwriting and other factors, including price. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business - Overview of Residential Mortgage Finance and the Role of the Private MI Industry in the Current Operating Environment - Competition,\" above. We expect the MI market to remain competitive, with pressure for industry participants to grow or maintain their market share.\nThe private MI industry overall competes more broadly with public MIs who significantly increased their presence in the MI market following the financial crisis. Although there has been broad policy consensus toward the need for private capital to play a larger role and government credit risk to be reduced in the U.S. housing finance system, it remains difficult to predict whether the combined market share of public MIs will recede to historical levels. A range of factors influence a lender's decision to choose private over public MI, including among others, premium rates and other charges, loan eligibility requirements, cancelability, loan size limits and the relative ease of use of private MI products compared to public MI alternatives.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated statements of operations\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>(In Thousands, except for share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>16,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(693\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>182,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance claims and claims expenses\n</td> <td>5,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting and operating expenses\n</td> <td>106,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>112,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain from change in fair value of warrant liability\n</td> <td>(4,105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,900\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(13,528\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>52,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,793\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>30,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,549\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,793\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss ratio(1)\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense ratio(2)\n</td> <td>64.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>67.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Loss ratio is calculated by dividing the provision for insurance claims and claims expenses by net premiums earned.\n(2) Expense ratio is calculated by dividing other underwriting and operating expenses by net premiums earned.\n(3) The 2016 prior period consolidated statements of operations has been revised. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2, Summary of Accounting Principles - Immaterial Correction of Prior Period Amounts,\" for further details.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net premiums earned totaled $165.7 million compared to $110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of net premiums earned of $55.2 million in 2017 was primarily due to the growth of our IIF and increased monthly policy production, partially offset by the decreases in single premium NIW and earnings from cancellations, and the impact of cessions under the 2017 ILN transaction and 2016 QSR Transaction. The $65.0 million increase in net premiums earned in 2016 was primarily due to the growth of our IIF, increased single premium NIW production and higher earnings from cancellations, partially offset by the effect of the 2016 QSR Transaction.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net investment income was $16.3 million compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in both periods was due to an increase in the size of and improved yields on our total investment portfolio.\nExpenses\nWe recognize insurance claims and claims expenses in connection with the loss experience of our insured portfolio and incur other underwriting and operating expenses, including employee compensation and benefits, policy acquisition costs, and technology, professional services and facilities expenses, in connection with the development and operation of our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, insurance claims and claims expenses were $5.3 million compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Insurance claims and claims expenses increased $2.9 million in 2017, as a result of new defaults on insured loans in areas impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires, as well as an increase in the overall number of policies in our portfolio and aging of earlier book years, offset by the partial release of reserves related to prior year defaults. Insurance claims and claims expenses increased $1.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in the overall number of policies in our portfolio and aging of earlier book years.\nUnderwriting and operating expenses were $107.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $93.2 million and $80.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Employee compensation accounts for the majority of our operating expenses. We increased the size of our workforce from 243 employees at December 31, 2015 to 276 employees at December 31, 2016 and to 299 employees at December 31, 2017 to support the growth of our business, particularly our sales and operating functions. Underwriting and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 also reflect $4.9 million of operating expenses related to the 2017 ILN Transaction and amendment of our Credit Agreement.\nInterest expense was $13.5 million, $14.8 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense declined in 2017 compared to 2016 in connection with the amendment of our Credit Agreement completed in February 2017, which among other items, reduced the interest spread payable on the Term Loan. The interest expense reduction was partially offset by a rise in the underlying LIBOR rate during 2017. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5, Term Loan.\" Interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting a full year of interest expense for the Term Loan, which we established in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nIncome tax expense was $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to income tax benefit of $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and no income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2015. The fluctuation of our income taxes is the result of significant events during each of periods presented. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $13.6 million primarily due to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a one-time non-cash benefit of $58.8 million related to the release of the valuation allowance recorded against our federal and certain state net deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not record an income tax expense due to the recognition of a valuation allowance against our federal and state net deferred tax assets.

See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2, Summary of Accounting Principles - Immaterial Correction of Prior Period Amounts,\" for further details.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $735.1 million in cash and investments, including $51.0 million held at NMIH. The increase in cash and investments from year-end 2016 primarily relates to cash generated from operations.\nNet deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) were $37.9 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $30.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by growth in the number of policies written during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the deferment of certain costs associated with the origination of those policies, partially offset by the amortization of previously deferred acquisition costs and the capitalization of ceding commissions associated with the 2016 QSR Transaction during the period.\nPremiums receivable increased to $25.2 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $13.7 million as of December 31, 2016 due to growth in the number of monthly policies in force.\nDeferred tax asset, net decreased to $19.9 million as of December 31, 2017, from $51.4 million at December 31, 2016 due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances at the reduced statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards during the period. For further information regarding income taxes and their impact on our results of operations and financial position, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11, Income Taxes.\"\nUnearned premiums increased $10.3 million to $163.2 million as of December 31, 2017, primarily due to single premium policy origination during the period, offset by the amortization through earnings of existing unearned premiums in accordance with the expiration of risk on the related policies and the cancellation of other single premium policies.\nReserve for insurance claims and claims expenses increased $5.8 million to $8.8 million at December 31, 2017, due to an increase in our default inventory at December 31, 2017. See \"- Insurance Claims and Claims Expenses,\" above for further details.\nWarrant liability increased to $7.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $3.4 million at December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in our stock price during the year.\nReinsurance funds withheld was $34.1 million as of December 31, 2017, representing the net of our ceded reinsurance premiums written, less our profit and ceding commission receivables related to the 2016 QSR Transaction. The increase in reinsurance\nfunds withheld of $3.5 million from December 31, 2016, was a result of increased ceded premiums written. See, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6, Reinsurance.\"\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated cash flows\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(93,072\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,792\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(230,165\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(3,241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,723\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $67.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily caused by increased operating expenses in connection with employee compensation and benefits costs and higher claims paid due to an increase in our default inventory offset by growth in direct premiums written. The increase in cash generated from operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the higher premiums written offset by increased operating expenses associated with the hiring of management and staff personnel and costs for contract and professional services.\nCash used in investing activities for the periods presented was driven by the purchase of fixed and short-term maturities during those periods.\nCash used in financing activities was $3.2 million and $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, and primarily relates to taxes paid on the net share settlement of equity awards for certain employees. Cash provided by financing activities was $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and primarily relates to proceeds from the Term Loan which we established in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nHolding Company Liquidity and Capital Resources\nNMIH serves as the holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. NMIH's principal liquidity demands include funds for: (i) payment of certain corporate expenses; (ii) payment of certain reimbursable expenses of its insurance subsidiaries; (iii) payment of principal and interest related to the Term Loan; (iv) tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service; (v) capital support for its subsidiaries; and (vi) payment of dividends, if any, on its common stock. NMIH is not subject to any limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations, such as NMIH, that are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware corporation law provides that dividends are only payable out of a corporation's surplus or recent net profits (subject to certain limitations).\nAs of December 31, 2017, NMIH had $51.0 million of cash and investments. NMIH's principal source of net cash is investment income and in the future could include dividends from NMIC, if available and permitted under law and by the GSEs.\nNMIH has entered into tax and expense-sharing agreements with its subsidiaries which have been approved by the Wisconsin OCI, but such approval may be changed or revoked at any time. With the Wisconsin OCI's approval, NMIH began allocating the interest expense on its Term Loan to NMIC in the first quarter of 2017, consistent with the benefits NMIC received when NMIH down-streamed the loan proceeds to NMIC.\nNMIC's ability to pay dividends to NMIH is subject to insurance department notice or approval. Under Wisconsin law, NMIC may pay dividends up to specified levels (i.e., \"ordinary\" dividends) with 30 days' prior notice to the Wisconsin OCI. Dividends in larger amounts, or \"extraordinary\" dividends, are subject to the Wisconsin OCI's prior approval. Under Wisconsin insurance laws, an extraordinary dividend is defined as any payment or distribution that together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer's statutory policyholders' surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) adjusted statutory net income for the 12-month period ending the preceding December 31. NMIC has never paid any dividends to NMIH. NMIC reported a statutory net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and currently cannot pay any dividends to NMIH through December 31, 2018 without the prior approval of the Wisconsin OCI. Certain other states in which NMIC is licensed also have statutes or regulations that restrict its ability to pay dividends.\nNMIC's capital needs depend on many factors including its ability to successfully write new business, establish premium rates at levels sufficient to cover claims and operating costs and meet minimum required asset thresholds under the PMIERs and state capital requirements. NMIC's capital needs also depend on its decision to access the reinsurance markets. NMIH may require liquidity to fund the capital needs of its insurance subsidiaries.\nIn November 2015, NMIH entered into the Credit Agreement for the Term Loan. On February 10, 2017, NMIH amended the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 1) to reduce the interest rate and extend the maturity date of the Term Loan from November 10, 2018 to November 10, 2019. The amended Term Loan bears interest at the Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement and subject to a 1.00% floor, plus an annual margin rate of 6.75%, payable monthly or quarterly based on our interest rate election. On October 25, 2017, NMIH further amended the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 2) to remove a covenant that required NMIH to maintain liquidity (as defined therein) in an aggregate amount no less than all remaining interest payments due under the Term Loan. As modified by Amendment No. 2, the Credit Agreement retains the requirement that NMIH maintain liquidity in an aggregate amount no less than the sum of all remaining principal amortization payments due under the Term Loan, excluding principal scheduled to be paid on its maturity date, determined to be $2.6 million as of December 31, 2017. The Credit Agreement contains other restrictive covenants and required financial ratios and tests (which were not modified by Amendments No.1 or No.2) that we are required to meet or maintain. The current covenants include, but are not limited to the following: a maximum debt-to-total capitalization ratio (as defined therein) of 35%, maximum RTC ratio of 22.0:1.0, minimum liquidity (as modified by Amendment No. 2 and defined therein), compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements (subject to any GSE-approved waivers), and minimum shareholders' equity requirements.\nConsolidated Investment Portfolio\nOur primary objectives with respect to our investment portfolio are to preserve capital and generate investment income, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to cover our operating needs. We aim to achieve diversification by type, quality, maturity, and industry. We have adopted an investment policy that defines, among other things, eligible and ineligible investments, concentration limits for asset types, industry sectors, single issuers, and certain credit ratings, and benchmarks for asset duration.\nSubstantially all of our investment portfolio is held in fixed maturity instruments. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of our investment portfolio was $715.9 million. We also had an additional $19.2 million of cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2017. Pre-tax book yield on the portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 2.3%. The book yield is calculated as period-to-date net investment income divided by average amortized cost of the investment portfolio. Yield on the investment portfolio is likely to change over time based on movements in interest rates, the duration or mix of our investment portfolio and other factors.\nThe following tables present a breakdown of our investment portfolio and cash and cash equivalents by investment type and credit rating: Table 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of portfolio's fair value\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate debt securities\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government agencies\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal debt securities\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ratings of our investment portfolio were:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment portfolio ratings at fair value\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAA\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA(1)\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A(1)\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB(1)\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Include +/- ratings.\nThe ratings above are provided by one or more of: Moody's, S&P and Fitch Ratings. If three ratings are available, we assign\nthe middle rating for classification purposes, otherwise we assign the lowest rating.\nOther-than-Temporary Impairment (OTTI)\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we held no other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) securities, and as of December 31, 2015, we held one OTTI security. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized OTTI losses in earnings of $144 thousand on a single security with an unfavorable recovery forecast. The impaired security was liquidated during the year. There were no credit losses recognized in earnings for which a portion of an OTTI loss was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized an OTTI loss in earnings of $89 thousand on a single security where we expected a planned sale would result in a loss. The impaired security was liquidated in 2016.\nTaxes\nWe are a U.S. taxpayer and are subject to a statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 35% for for all prior years through December 31, 2017. We will be subject to a statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% for the years ending December 31, 2018 and all future periods. Our holding company files a consolidated U.S. federal and various state income tax returns on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries.\nProvisional amounts\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. We have not completed our full assessment of the tax effects of the enactment of the Act on our December 31, 2017 balances; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects on our deferred tax balances. We recognized a $13.6 million income tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2017 for the items we could reasonably estimate primarily related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We are still analyzing the Act and refining our calculation on deferred our tax asset related to share-based compensation, which could affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to further increases or decreases to our deferred tax amounts. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Act expanded the number of individuals whose compensation is subject to a $1 million cap on tax deductibility and includes performance-based compensation in the calculation. As a result, the Company recorded a provisional amount to reduce the future tax benefit related to share-based compensation. We will continue to make and refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. In addition, our estimates may also be affected as we gain a more thorough understanding of the tax law.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) on December 23, 2017. SAB 118 provides a one-year measurement period from a registrant's reporting period that includes the Act's enactment date to allow the registrant sufficient time to obtain, prepare and analyze information to complete the accounting required under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740.\nThe ultimate impact of the Act on our reported results in fiscal 2017 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided herein, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and other actions we may take as a result of the Act differently from that presently contemplated.\nOur effective income tax rate on our pre-tax income was 58.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective income tax rate on our pre-tax loss was (459.0)% and 0.0% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The difference between our statutory tax rate and our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to tax expense of $13.6 million associated with the enactment of the Act, partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.3 million from excess share-based compensation for vested restricted stock units (RSUs) and exercised stock options. The difference between our statutory tax rate and our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the release of the valuation allowance in 2016. Starting in 2018, we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate will approximate the statutory corporate tax rates.\nSince inception and prior to December 31, 2016, we recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, and, as such, we generally did not record a benefit associated with the losses incurred in prior periods or other income tax benefits. At December 31, 2016, after weighing applicable evidence, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that our deferred tax asset would be realized. As a result, as of December 31, 2016, we released the valuation allowance on federal and certain state deferred tax assets. We continued to record a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets, primarily related to state net operating losses generated by NMIH that we do not expect to be utilized. NMIH operates at a loss and continues to only generate revenue from its investment portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the positive evidence that weighed in favor of releasing the valuation allowance and ultimately outweighed the negative evidence against releasing the allowance included:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our net operating loss carryforwards were expected to be fully utilized by 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our other deferred tax assets were based on known recognition schedules and our expectation was that the majority would either reverse in the next three years or were related to deferred tax liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our significant unearned premium balance which represents future revenue to be earned over the policies' lives;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the substantial growth in our IIF driving the increase in net premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our positive earnings trends from quarterly and annual increases in revenue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our taxable income in 2016 and our expected taxable income in future years; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our expectation that we will be in a cumulative profit in a three-year period in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The primary negative evidence that was considered was our cumulative losses in recent years. Although ASC 740 does not define the term or the length of time to consider when calculating the cumulative loss, practice and interpretations suggest that the guideline, not a \"bright line\", is to aggregate the pretax results as adjusted for permanent items for three years (i.e., the current and the two preceding years).\nAt December 31, 2016, we concluded that positive evidence of sufficient quantity and quality outweighed negative evidence and supported our conclusion that it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our federal and certain state deferred tax assets. The reversal of our beginning-of-the-year valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets (resulting from a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets in future years) is consistent with the requirements of ASC 740-10-45-20. At December 31, 2016, we released the valuation allowance on federal and certain state deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance continued to be recorded against net state deferred tax assets, primarily related to state net operating losses by NMIH that we do not expect to be utilized. NMIH operates at a loss and currently only generates revenue from its investment portfolio.\nWe have examined the results through December 31, 2017, and performed a review of future expectations, which continue to support the conclusion that it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our federal and certain state deferred tax assets. We also concluded to continue to apply a valuation allowance to the net state deferred tax assets, primarily related to state net operating losses by NMIH that we do not expect to be utilized.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $93.3 million which expires from 2030 to 2037, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $89.1 million, which expire in varying amounts during the years 2031 to 2037. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes annual limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards if it experiences an \"ownership change.\" As a result of the acquisition of our insurance subsidiaries in 2012, $7.3 million of NOLs were subject to annual limitations of $0.8 million through 2016, and $0.3 million, thereafter, through 2029.\nThere is a tax sharing agreement between NMIH and its subsidiaries, dated August 23, 2012 and amended on September 1, 2016. Under this agreement, each of the parties mutually agreed to file a consolidated federal income tax return for 2012 and subsequent tax years, with NMIH as the direct tax filer. The tax liability of each subsidiary that is party to the agreement is limited to the amount of the liability it would incur if it filed separate returns.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017. In connection with the 2017 ILN Transaction, we have certain future contractual commitments to Oaktown Re, a special purpose VIE that is not consolidated in our financial results. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2, Summary of Accounting Principles - Variable interest entity\" and \"Note 6, Reinsurance.\"\nContractual obligations at December 31, 2017 are summarized in the table that follows.\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>1,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>3,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities reflected on the registrant's balance sheet under GAAP\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Long-term debt relates to our $150 million Credit Agreement and includes future interest payments using the minimum interest rate in effect at December 31, 2017 of 7.75%.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Because the use of estimates is inherent in GAAP, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. A summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below.\nInsurance Premium Revenue Recognition\nPremiums for primary mortgage insurance policies may be paid in a single payment at origination (single premium), on a monthly installment basis (monthly premium) or on an annual installment basis (annual premium), with such election and payment type fixed at policy inception. Premiums written at origination for single premium policies are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and amortized into earnings over the estimated policy life in accordance with the anticipated expiration of risk. Monthly premiums are recognized as revenue in the month billed as coverage is effective. Annual premiums are initially deferred and earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. Premiums written on pool transactions are earned over the period that coverage is provided. Upon cancellation of a policy, all remaining non-refundable deferred and unearned premium is immediately earned, and any refundable premium is returned to the policyholder. Premiums returned to the policyholder are recorded as a reduction of written and earned premiums in the paid period.\nReserve for Claims and Claims Expenses\nConsistent with industry practice, we establish reserves for claims based on our best estimate of ultimate claim costs for defaulted loans using the general principles contained in ASC 944, Financial Services - Insurance (ASC 944). We establish reserves for loans that have been in default for at least 60 days. Reserves for claims and allocated claims expenses, referred to as case reserves, are established when we are notified of defaults by loan servicers. Additional claims reserves, referred to as IBNR reserves, are established for loans that we estimate (based on actuarial review) have been in default for at least 60 days, but have not yet been reported to us as such by servicers. We also establish reserves for unallocated claims expenses not associated with specific claims. Claims expenses represent the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees, as well as other general expenses of administering the claims settlement process.\nThe establishment of claims and claims expense reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. Reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in default that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as claim frequency, and the amount of the claim payment expected to be paid on each such loan in default, which is\nreferred to as claim severity. Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical observed experience regarding certain loan factors, such as age of the default, size of the loan and LTV ratios, and are strongly influenced by prevailing economic conditions, such as mortgage rates, trends in unemployment and house price appreciation. We conduct an annual actuarial review to evaluate, and, if necessary, update these assumptions.\nInvestments\nWe have designated our investment portfolio as available-for-sale and report it at fair value. The related unrealized gains and losses, after considering the related tax expense or benefit, are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity. Net realized investment gains and losses are reported in income based on specific identification of securities sold, and are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nWe measure fair value and classify invested assets in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three \"levels\" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments.\"\nEach fiscal quarter, we evaluate our investments to determine whether declines in fair value below amortized cost were considered other-than-temporary in accordance with applicable guidance. Under current guidance, a debt security impairment is deemed other-than-temporary if (i) we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery or (ii) we do not expect to collect cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. In evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, but not limited to:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>severity and duration of the decline in fair value;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the financial condition of the issuer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>recent credit downgrades of the applicable security or the issuer below investment grade; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or a geographic area.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPremium Deficiency Reserve\nWe perform a premium deficiency calculation each fiscal quarter using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date. Per ASC 944, a premium deficiency reserve shall be recognized if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses, expected dividends to policyholders, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds future premiums, existing reserves and anticipated investment income. The calculation of premium deficiency reserves requires the use of significant judgment and estimates to determine the present value of future premiums and present value of expected claims and expenses on our business. The present value of future premiums relies on, among other things, assumptions about persistency and repayment patterns on underlying loans. The present value of expected claims and expenses depends on assumptions relating to severity of claims, claim rates on current defaults and expected defaults in future periods. These assumptions may also include an estimate of expected rescission activity. Assumptions used in calculating premium deficiency reserves can be affected by volatility in the current housing and mortgage lending industries. To the extent premium patterns and actual claim experience differ from the assumptions used in calculating a premium deficiency reserve, the differences between the actual results and our estimate will affect future period earnings. In considering the potential sensitivity of the factors underlying our best estimate of premium deficiency reserves, it is possible that even a relatively small change in estimated claim rate or a relatively small percentage change in estimated claim amount could have a significant impact on establishing a premium deficiency reserve, should one be needed, and, correspondingly, on our operating results.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nCosts directly associated with the successful acquisition of mortgage insurance policies, consisting of certain selling expenses and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses, are initially deferred and reported as DAC. DAC is reviewed periodically to determine that it does not exceed recoverable amounts and is adjusted as appropriate for policy cancellations to be consistent with our revenue recognition policy. We estimate the rate of amortization to reflect actual experience and any changes to persistency or loss development. For each book year of business, these costs are amortized to expense in proportion to estimated gross profits over the estimated life of the policies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the expected future tax effects of temporary differences at the enacted tax rates applicable for the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements that would result in future increases or decreases in taxes owed on a cash basis as compared to amounts already recognized as tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Changes in tax laws, rates, regulations and policies, or the final determination of tax audits or examinations, could materially affect our tax estimates.\nWe are required to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We assess our need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. In the course of our review, we assess all available evidence, both positive and negative, including future sources of income, tax planning strategies, future contractual cash flows and reversing temporary differences, and are required to exercise judgment and make assumptions in this regard.\nOur provision for income taxes for interim financial periods is based on an estimate of our annual effective tax rate for the full year. When estimating our full year effective tax rate, we adjust our forecasted pre-tax income for gains and losses on our investments, changes in the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, changes in our beginning of year valuation allowance, and other adjustments. The impact of these items is accounted for discretely at the applicable federal tax rate.\nWarrants\nWe account for warrants to purchase our common shares in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC 815-40 Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. Our outstanding warrants may be settled by us using either (i) a physical settlement method or (ii) cashless exercise, where shares that are issued upon exercise of the warrants are reduced to cover the cost of the exercise, in lieu of the holder remitting a cash payment of the exercise price. The warrants expire, and are not exercisable after the 10th anniversary of the date they were issued. The exercise price and the number of warrants are subject to anti-dilution provisions whereby the existing exercise price is adjusted downward, and the number of warrants increased, for events that may not be dilutive. The adjustment may be in excess of any dilution suffered. As a result, the warrants are classified as a liability. We revalue the warrants at the end of each reporting period, and any change in fair value is reported in the statements of operations in the period in which the change occurred. We calculate the fair value of the warrants using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model in combination with a binomial model. We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the pricing protection features within the warrants. Variables in the model include the fair value of the stock, risk-free rate of return, dividend yield, expected life and expected volatility of the Company's stock price.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which addresses accounting for share-based awards and recognition of compensation expense, measured using grant date fair value, over the requisite service or performance period of the award. Share-based compensation includes RSUs and stock option grants under the NMI Holdings, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (2012 Plan) and the NMI Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Amended 2014 Plan), which amended and restated the NMI Holdings, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2014 Plan). We calculate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which takes into account various subjective assumptions. Key assumptions used in the model include the expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate, as well as the expected option term, giving consideration to the contractual terms of any award and the effects of expected exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. RSU grants to employees may contain a service condition, market and service condition or performance and service condition. RSU grants to employees with a service or a performance condition and RSU grants to non-employee directors are valued at our stock price on the date of grant less the present value of anticipated dividends. The fair value of RSU grants to employees with a market condition are determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of grant.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included below in Item 8 of this report and the Risk Factors included above in Part I, Item 1A of this report. In addition, investors should review the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" above.\nOverview\nWe provide private MI through our wholly owned insurance subsidiaries NMIC and Re One. NMIC and Re One are domiciled in Wisconsin and principally regulated by the Wisconsin OCI. NMIC is our primary insurance subsidiary, and is approved as an MI provider by the GSEs and is licensed to write coverage in all 50 states and D.C. Re One provides statutorily required reinsurance to NMIC on insured loans with coverage levels in excess of 25% after giving effect to third-party reinsurance. Our subsidiary, NMIS, provides outsourced loan review services to mortgage loan originators.\nMI protects lenders and investors from default-related losses on a portion of the unpaid principal balance of a covered mortgage. MI plays a critical role in the U.S. housing market by mitigating mortgage credit risk and facilitating the secondary market sale of high-LTV (i.e. above 80%) residential loans to the GSEs, who are otherwise restricted by their charters from purchasing or guaranteeing high-LTV mortgages that are not covered by certain credit protections. Such credit protection and secondary market sales allow lenders to increase their capacity for mortgage commitments and expand financing access to existing and prospective homeowners.\nNMIH, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in May 2011, and we began start-up operations in 2012 and wrote our first MI policy in 2013. Since formation, we have sought to establish customer relationships with a broad group of mortgage lenders and build a diversified, high-quality insured portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, we had master policies with 1,267 customers, including national and regional mortgage banks, money center banks, credit unions, community banks, builder-owned mortgage lenders, internet-sourced lenders and other non-bank lenders. We had total IIF of $51.7 billion and gross RIF of $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to total IIF of $35.8 billion and gross RIF of $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2016, and total IIF of $19.1 billion and gross RIF of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2015. Included in our total IIF as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $48.5 billion, $32.2 billion and $14.8 billion of primary IIF, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, our gross primary RIF was $11.8 billion, compared to $7.8 billion and $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated NIW of $21.6 billion, compared to $21.2 billion and $12.4 billion for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had 299 full-time employees.\nWe believe that our success in acquiring a large and diverse group of lender customers and growing a portfolio of high-quality IIF traces to our founding principles, whereby we aim to help qualified individuals achieve the dream of homeownership, ensure that we remain a strong and credible counterparty, deliver a unique customer service experience, establish a differentiated risk management approach that emphasizes the individual underwriting review or validation of the vast majority of the loans we insure, and foster a culture of collaboration and excellence that helps us attract and retain experienced industry leaders.\nOur strategy is to continue to build on our position in the private MI market, expand our customer base and grow our insured portfolio of high-quality residential loans by focusing on long-term customer relationships, disciplined and proactive risk selection and pricing, fair and transparent claims payment practices, responsive customer service, financial strength and profitability.\nOur common stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol \"NMIH.\"\nWe discuss below our results of operations for the periods presented, as well as the conditions and trends that have impacted or are expected to impact our business, including customer development, new business writings, the composition of our insurance portfolio and other factors that we expect to impact our results.\nConditions and Trends Impacting Our Business\nCustomer Development\nWe have important relationships with customers across all categories and allocation profiles, including National Accounts and Regional Accounts, and centralized and decentralized lenders. Our sales and marketing efforts are broadly focused on expanding our presence with existing customers and activating new customer relationships. We consider an activation to be the point at which we have signed a Master Policy, established IT connectivity and generated a first application or first NIW from a customer. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we activated 127 lenders, compared to 173 and 247 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also continued to expand our business with existing customers, deepening our existing relationships and capturing what we believe to be an increasing portion of their annual MI volume. At December 31, 2017, we had 1,267 Master Policies and 841 active customer relationships, compared to 1,131 and 715 as of December 31, 2016 and 964 and 524 as of December 31, 2015.\nNew Insurance Written, Insurance In Force and Risk In Force\nNIW is the aggregate unpaid principal balance of mortgages underpinning new policies written during a given period. Our NIW is affected by the overall size of the mortgage origination market and the volume of high-LTV mortgage originations, which tend to be generated to a greater extent in purchase originations as compared to refinancings. Our NIW is also affected by the percentage of such high-LTV originations covered by private versus public MI or other alternative credit enhancement structures and our share of the private MI market. NIW, together with persistency, drives our IIF. IIF is the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the mortgages we insure, as reported to us by servicers at a given date, and represents the sum total of NIW from all prior periods less principal payments on insured mortgages and policy cancellations (including for prepayment, nonpayment of premiums, coverage rescission and claim payments). RIF is related to IIF and represents the aggregate amount of coverage we provide on all outstanding policies at a given date. RIF is calculated as the sum total of the coverage percentage of each individual policy in our portfolio applied to the unpaid principal balance of such insured mortgage. RIF is affected by IIF and the LTV profile of our insured mortgages, with lower LTV loans generally having a lower coverage percentage and higher LTV loans having a higher coverage percentage. Gross RIF represents RIF before consideration of reinsurance. Net RIF is gross RIF net of ceded reinsurance.\nNet Premiums Written and Net Premiums Earned\nWe set our premium rates on individual policies based on the risk characteristics of the underlying mortgage loans and borrowers, and in accordance with our filed rates and applicable rating rules.\nPremiums are generally fixed over the estimated life of the underlying loans. Net premiums written are equal to gross premiums written minus ceded premiums written under our reinsurance arrangements and less premium refunds. As a result, net premiums written are generally influenced by:\n \u2022 NIW; \n \u2022 premium rates and the mix of premium payment type, which are either single, monthly or annual premiums, as described below; \n \u2022 cancellation rates of our insurance policies, which are impacted by payments or prepayments on mortgages, refinancings (which are affected by prevailing mortgage interest rates as compared to interest rates on loans underpinning our in force policies), levels of claims payments and home prices; \n \u2022 cession of premiums under third-party reinsurance arrangements.  Premiums are paid either by the borrower (BPMI) or the lender (LPMI) in a single payment at origination (single premium), on a monthly installment basis (monthly premium) or on an annual installment basis (annual premium). Our net premiums written will differ from our net premiums earned due to policy payment type. For single premiums, we receive a single premium payment at origination, which is initially recorded as unearned premium and earned over the estimated life of the policy. A majority of our single premium policies in force as of December 31, 2017 were non-refundable under most cancellation scenarios. If non-refundable single premium policies are canceled, we immediately recognize the remaining unearned premium balances as earned premium revenue. Monthly premiums are recognized in the month billed and when the coverage is effective. Annual premiums are earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. Substantially all of our policies provide for either single or monthly premiums.\nThe percentage of IIF that remains on our books after any 12-month period is defined as our persistency rate. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, higher persistency rates can have a significant impact on our net premiums earned and profitability. Generally, faster speeds of mortgage prepayment lead to lower persistency. Prepayment speeds and the relative mix of business between single and monthly premium policies also impact our profitability. Our premium rates include\ncertain assumptions regarding repayment or prepayment speeds of the mortgages underlying our policies. Because premiums are paid at origination on single premium policies and substantially all of our single premium policies are non-refundable on cancellation, assuming all other factors remain constant, if single premium loans are prepaid earlier than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to increase and, if loans are repaid slower than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to decrease. By contrast, if monthly premium loans are repaid earlier than anticipated, we do not earn any more premium with respect to those loans and, unless we replace the repaid monthly premium loan with a new loan, our profitability is likely to decline.\nEffect of reinsurance on our results\nWe utilize third-party reinsurance to actively manage our risk, ensure PMIERs compliance and support the growth of our business. We currently have both quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements in place, which impact our results of operations and regulatory capital and PMIERs asset positions. Under a quota share reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer receives a premium in exchange for covering an agreed-upon portion of incurred losses. Such a quota share arrangement reduces net premiums written and earned and also reduces net RIF, providing capital relief to the ceding insurance company and reducing incurred claims in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement. In addition, reinsurers typically pay ceding commissions as part of quota share transactions, which offset the ceding company's acquisition and underwriting expenses. Certain quota share agreements include profit commissions that are earned based on loss performance and serve to reduce ceded premiums. Under an excess-of-loss agreement, the ceding insurer is typically responsible for losses up to an agreed-upon threshold and the reinsurer then provides coverage in excess of such threshold up to a maximum agreed-upon limit. In general, there are no ceding commissions under excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements. We expect to continue to evaluate reinsurance opportunities in the normal course of business.\nQuota share reinsurance\nNMIC entered into the 2016 QSR Transaction in September 2016. Under the terms of the 2016 QSR Transaction, NMIC (1) ceded 100% of the risk relating to our pool agreement with Fannie Mae, (2) ceded 25% of existing risk written on eligible policies as of August 31, 2016 and (3) ceded 25% of the risk relating to eligible primary insurance policies written between September 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claims expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 60% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.\nNMIC entered into the 2018 QSR Transaction, which took effect January 1, 2018. Under the 2018 QSR Transaction, NMIC agrees to cede 25% of its eligible policies written in 2018 and 20% to 30% (such amount to be determined by NMIC at its sole election by December 1, 2018) of eligible policies written in 2019, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claims expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 61% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.\nExcess-of-loss reinsurance\nIn May 2017, NMIC secured $211.3 million of aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage at inception for an existing portfolio of MI policies written from 2013 through December 31, 2016, through a mortgage insurance-linked notes offering by Oaktown Re. The reinsurance coverage amount under the terms of the 2017 ILN Transaction decreases from $211.3 million at inception over a ten-year period as the underlying covered mortgages amortize and/or are repaid, and was $177 million as of December 31, 2017. For the reinsurance coverage period, NMIC will retain the first layer of $126.8 million of aggregate losses and Oaktown Re will then provide a second layer of coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount.

Primary NIW increased 71% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily because of the growth within and an expansion of our customer base.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, 81% of our NIW related to monthly premium policies, as compared to 67% and 48% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, monthly premium policies accounted for 69% of our primary IIF, as compared to 60% at December 31, 2016 and 47% at December 31, 2015. We expect the break-down of monthly premium policies and single premium policies (which we refer to as \"mix\") in our primary IIF to continue to trend toward our current NIW mix over time. Our total IIF at December 31, 2017 increased 44% compared to December 31, 2016, which in turn increased 88% compared to December 31, 2015, primarily because of the NIW we generated between such measurement dates and higher persistency of our policies in force.\nThe following table presents net premiums written and earned for the periods indicated.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary and pool premiums written and earned\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned (1)\n</td> <td>165,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Net premiums written and earned are reported net of reinsurance and premium refunds.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net premiums written and earned increased 29% and 50%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net premiums written is due to the growth of our IIF and increased monthly policy production, partially offset by a decrease in single premium NIW. The trend in net premiums written was also impacted by the inception of the 2016 QSR Transaction in September 2016, which entailed an initial cession of $35 million of premiums written on all covered singles policies written prior to the transaction effective date and had the effect of reducing net premiums written in 2016 by a like amount. The increase in net premiums earned is due to the growth of our IIF and increased monthly policy production, partially offset by decreases in our single premium NIW and earnings from cancellations, and the impact of cessions under the 2017 ILN transaction and 2016 QSR Transaction.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net premiums written and earned increased 18% and 143%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increases in net premiums written and earned are primarily due to the growth of our IIF and increased NIW production, partially offset by ceded premiums related to the 2016 QSR Transaction, which entailed an initial cession of premiums written on all covered singles policies written prior to the transaction effective date and introduced partial cessions of premiums written and earned on covered policies thereafter.\nPool premiums written and earned for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, were $3.8 million, $4.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively, before giving effect to the 2016 QSR Transaction, under which all of our written and earned pool premiums have been ceded.\nPortfolio Statistics\nUnless otherwise noted, the portfolio statistics tables presented below do not include the effects of our third-party reinsurance arrangements described above.

In general, the majority of underwriting profit, calculated as earned premium revenue minus claims and underwriting and operating expenses, generated by a particular book year emerges in the years immediately following origination. This pattern generally occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years following origination, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments), and by increasing losses.\nThe table below reflects a summary of our primary IIF and RIF by book year as of the dates indicated.\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary IIF and RIF\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>IIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IIF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RIF\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>18,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>8,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>1,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe utilize certain risk principles that form the basis of how we underwrite and originate primary NIW. We manage our portfolio credit risk by using several loan eligibility matrices which prescribe the maximum LTV, minimum borrower FICO score, maximum borrower DTI ratio, maximum loan size, property type, loan type, loan term and occupancy status of loans that we will insure. Our loan eligibility matrices, as well as all of our detailed underwriting guidelines, are contained in our Underwriting Guideline Manual that is publicly available on our website. Our eligibility criteria and underwriting guidelines are designed to mitigate the layered risk inherent in a single insurance policy. \"Layered risk\" refers to the accumulation of borrower, loan and property risk. For example, we have higher credit score and lower maximum allowed LTV requirements for investor-owned properties, compared to owner-occupied properties. We monitor the concentrations of various risk attributes in our insurance portfolio, which may change over time, in part, as a result of regional conditions or public policy shifts.\nThe tables below present our primary NIW by FICO, LTV and purchase/refinance mix for the periods indicated. We calculate the LTV of a loan as the percentage of the original loan amount to the original purchase value of the property securing the loan.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

Claims incurred is generally affected by a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 future macroeconomic factors, including unemployment, which affects the likelihood that borrowers may default on their loans, and rising interest rates, which tend to increase persistency, thereby extending the average life of our insured portfolio and increasing expected future claims; \n \u2022 changes in housing values, as such changes may affect loss mitigation opportunities on loans in default, as well as borrowers' behaviors and willingness to default if the values of their homes are below or perceived to be below their mortgage balances; \n \u2022 borrowers' FICO scores, with lower FICO scores tending to have higher probabilities of claims; \n \u2022 LTV ratios, with higher average LTV ratios tending to increase claims incurred; \n \u2022 DTI ratios, with higher DTIs generally tending to increase claims incurred; \n \u2022 the size of loans insured, with higher average loan amounts tending to increase claims incurred; \n \u2022 the percentage of coverage on insured loans, with higher percentages of insurance coverage tending to result in higher incurred claim amounts than lower percentages of insurance coverage; \n \u2022 other borrower and loan level risk characteristics, such as cash-out refinancings, second homes or investment properties \n \u2022 the rate at which we rescind policies, which we expect to be lower for us than recent rescission rates experienced by the private MI industry due to the terms of our Master Policy and generally tighter underwriting standards; and \n \u2022 the distribution of claims over the life of a book year.  Reserves for claims and allocated claims expenses are established for mortgage loan defaults, which we refer to as case reserves, when we are notified that a borrower has missed two or more mortgage payments (i.e., an NOD). We also make estimates of IBNR defaults, which are defaults that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, based on historical reporting trends, and establish IBNR reserves for those estimates. We also establish reserves for unallocated claims expenses not associated with a specific claim. The claims expenses consist of the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees as well as other general expenses of administering the claims settlement process.\nReserves are established by estimating the number of loans in default that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as claim frequency, and the amount of the claim payment expected to be paid on each such loan in default, which is referred to as\nclaim severity. Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical observed experience regarding certain loan factors, such as age of the default, cure rates, size of the loan and estimated change in property valuation. Reserves are released the month in which a loan in default is brought current by the borrower, which is referred to as a cure. Adjustments to reserve estimates are reflected in the period in which the adjustment is made. Reserves are also ceded to reinsurers under the 2016 QSR Transaction and will be ceded under the 2018 QSR Transaction beginning in 2018. We will not cede reserves to the reinsurer under the 2017 ILN Transaction unless losses exceed our retained coverage layer. Reserves are not established for future claims on insured loans which are not currently in default.\nBased on our experience and industry data, we believe that claims incidence for mortgage insurance is generally highest in the third through sixth years after loan origination. As of December 31, 2017, over 95% of our primary IIF was related to business written since January 1, 2015. Although the claims experience on new primary insurance written by us to date has been favorable, we expect incurred claims to increase as a greater amount of our existing insured portfolio reaches its anticipated period of highest claim frequency. We estimate that the loss ratio over the life of our existing primary insured portfolio will be between 20% and 25% of earned premiums, and we price to that expectation. Additionally, our pool insurance agreement with Fannie Mae contains a claim deductible through which Fannie Mae absorbs specified losses before we are obligated to pay any claims. We have not established any pool reserves for claims or IBNR to date.\nThe actual claims we incur as our portfolio matures are difficult to predict and depend on the specific characteristics of our current in-force book (including the credit score and DTI of the borrower, the LTV ratio of the mortgage and geographic concentrations, among others), as well as the profile of new business we write in the future. In addition, claims experience will be affected by future macroeconomic factors such as housing prices, interest rates and employment and other events, such as natural catastrophes. To date, our claims experience is developing at a slower pace than historical trends indicate, as a result of high quality underwriting, a strong macroeconomic environment and a favorable housing market. For additional discussion of our reserves, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 7, Reserves for Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses.\"\nWe insure mortgages for homes in areas that have been impacted by recent natural disasters, including hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires. We do not provide coverage for property or casualty claims related to physical damage of a home underpinning an insured mortgage. We have experienced an increase in NODs on insured loans in the impacted areas. Our ultimate claims exposure will depend on the number of NODs received, proximate cause of each default and cure rate of the NOD population. In the event of natural disasters, cure rates are influenced by the adequacy of homeowners and other hazard insurance carried on a related property, GSE-sponsored forbearance and other assistance programs, and a borrower's access to aid from government entities and private organizations, in addition to other factors which generally impact cure rates in unaffected areas.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending reserve balances for primary insurance claims and claims expenses.\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less reinsurance recoverables (1)\n</td> <td>(297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning balance, net of reinsurance recoverables\n</td> <td>2,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add claims incurred:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Claims and claim expenses incurred:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current year (2)\n</td> <td>6,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior years (3)\n</td> <td>(801\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total claims and claims expenses incurred\n</td> <td>5,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less claims paid:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Claims and claim expenses paid:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current year (2)\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior years (3)\n</td> <td>1,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total claims and claim expenses paid\n</td> <td>1,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve at end of period, net of reinsurance recoverables\n</td> <td>6,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add reinsurance recoverables (1)\n</td> <td>1,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>679\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Related to ceded losses recoverable on the 2016 QSR Transaction, included in \"Other Assets\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The amount of claims incurred for current year NODs represents the estimated amount to be ultimately paid on such loans in default. The decreases during the periods presented in reserves held for prior year defaults represent favorable development and are generally the result of NOD cures and ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends. We may increase or decrease our original estimates as we learn additional information about individual defaults and claims, and continue to observe and analyze loss development trends in our portfolio. Gross reserves of $1.0 million related to prior year defaults remained as of December 31, 2017.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending count of loans in default.\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning default inventory\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: new defaults\n</td> <td>1,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: cures\n</td> <td>(486\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: claims paid\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending default inventory\n</td> <td>928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the ending default inventory at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016, was primarily due to new defaults on insured loans in areas impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires, as well as the aging of earlier book years and an increase in the overall number of policies in our portfolio. The increase in the ending default inventory at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 is tied to the growth in the number of policies in force and the expected loss development of our portfolio.\nThe following table provides details of our claims paid, before giving effect to claims ceded under the 2016 QSR Transaction, for the periods indicated.\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ Values In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of claims paid\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total amount paid for claims\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average amount paid per claim\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severity(1)\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Severity represents the total amount of claims paid divided by the related RIF on the loan at the time the claim is perfected.\nThe increase in the number of claims paid for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, is due to an increase in our default inventory. We expect the severity of claims we receive to be between 85% and 95% of the coverage amount for the near-term.\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average reserve per default:\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Case (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IBNR\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Defined as the gross reserve per insured loan in default.\nThe average reserve per default at December 31, 2017 decreased from December 31, 2016 primarily due to new defaults on insured loans in areas impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires. As of December 31, 2017, 533 of the 928 loans in default relate to homes in areas declared by FEMA to be disaster zones following the aforementioned natural disasters. We anticipate that this population of loans in default will cure at a higher rate than the estimated rate we apply to non-disaster related loans in default, due to our Master Policy coverage terms, historical industry experience, and current economic indicators and relief programs. As such, we have established lower reserves for these NODs than we otherwise do for similarly situated NODs in non-disaster zones. Over time, we anticipate that our average reserve per default will revert to our historical averages as the NODs in these zones cure.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our business has been subject to modest seasonality in both NIW production and default experience. Consistent with the seasonality of home sales, purchase origination volumes typically increase in late spring and peak during the summer months, leading to a rise in NIW volume during the second and third quarters of a given year. Refinancing volume, however, does not follow a set seasonal trend and instead is primarily influenced by mortgage rates. An increase in refinancing volume may limit the seasonal effect of home purchase patterns on mortgage insurance NIW. In addition, while macroeconomic factors in any given period may influence default experience to a greater extent than does seasonality, our industry has typically experienced a fourth quarter seasonal increase in the number of defaults and a first quarter seasonal decline in the number of defaults and increase in the number of cures.\nGSE Oversight\nAs an Approved Insurer, NMIC is subject to ongoing compliance with the PMIERs. (Italicized terms have the same meaning that such terms have in the PMIERs, as described below.) The PMIERs establish operational, business, remedial and financial\nrequirements applicable to Approved Insurers. The PMIERs financial requirements prescribe a risk-based methodology whereby the amount of assets required to be held against each insured loan is determined based on certain risk characteristics, such as FICO, vintage (year of origination), performing vs. non-performing (i.e., current vs. delinquent), LTV and other risk features. An asset charge is calculated for each insured loan based on its risk profile. In general, higher quality loans carry lower charges.\nUnder the PMIERs financial requirements, Approved Insurers must maintain available assets that equal or exceed minimum required assets, which is an amount equal to the greater of (i) $400 million or (ii) a total risk-based required asset amount. The risk-based required asset amount is a function of the risk profile of an Approved Insurer's net RIF, calculated by applying on a loan-by-loan basis certain risk-based factors derived from tables set out in the PMIERs to the net RIF, and other transactional adjustments approved by the GSEs, such as with respect to our 2017 ILN Transaction and 2016 QSR Transaction. The risk-based required asset amount for primary insurance is subject to a floor of 5.6% of total, performing, primary RIF, and the risk-based required asset amount for pool insurance considers both the factors in the tables and the net remaining stop loss for each pool insurance policy. The PMIERs financial requirements also increase the amount of available assets that must be held by an Approved Insurer for LPMI policies originated on or after January 1, 2016.\nBy April 15th of each year, NMIC must certify it met all PMIERs requirements as of December 31st of the prior year. As of December 31, 2017, NMIC had sufficient available assets to meet the PMIERs financial requirements, and we expect to certify to the GSEs by April 15, 2018 that NMIC fully complied with the PMIERs as of December 31, 2017. NMIC also has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of its failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements. We continuously monitor our compliance with the PMIERs.\nThe following table provides a comparison of the PMIERs financial requirements as reported by NMIC as of the dates indicated.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ values in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>527,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>453,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Risk-Based Required Assets\n</td> <td>446,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>366,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAvailable assets were $528 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $454 million at December 31, 2016 and $431 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in available assets of $74 million at December 31, 2017 and $23 million at December 31, 2016 was driven by positive cash flow from operations and the amortization of unearned premium reserves during each period. The increase in the risk-based required asset amount at each measurement date is due to the growth of our gross RIF, partially offset by the cession of risk relating to our third-party reinsurance agreements.\nOn December 18, 2017, the GSEs provided us with a confidential summary of the proposed changes to the PMIERs financial, business and other requirements that they are developing with the FHFA. We have engaged in conversations with the FHFA and the GSEs about the proposed changes and expect to continue to provide feedback to them in the coming months. Once changes to the PMIERs requirements are finalized, we expect the industry will be afforded a six month implementation period and currently anticipate that updated PMIERs requirements, if any, will take effect no sooner than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nCybersecurity\nAs a participant in the mortgage lending and MI industries, we rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide and expand our products and services. We have established and implemented security measures, controls and procedures to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed and/or stored in such systems. We periodically employ third parties to evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, controls and procedures. In addition, we have established a business continuity plan that is designed to allow our business to continue to operate in the midst of certain disruptive events, including any disruptions to our information technology systems. We also have an incident response plan that is designed to address information security incidents, including breaches of our information technology systems. Despite these safeguards, disruptions to and breaches of our information technology systems are possible and may negatively impact our business.\nWe maintain cyber errors and omissions coverage to limit our exposure if an incident occurs. This insurance provides coverage for (i) claims related to, among other things, unauthorized network or computer access, unintentional disclosure or misuse of personally identifiable information in our possession, unintentional failure to disclose a breach and (ii) certain costs related to privacy notification, crisis management, cyber extortion, data recovery and business interruption.\nCapital Position of Our Insurance Subsidiaries and Financial Strength Ratings\nIn addition to GSE-imposed asset requirements, NMIC is also subject to state regulatory minimum capital requirements based on its RIF. While formulations of this minimum capital may vary by jurisdiction, the most common measure allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 25:1.\nAs of December 31, 2017, NMIC's performing primary RIF, net of reinsurance, was approximately $7.3 billion. NMIC ceded 100% of its pool RIF pursuant to the 2016 QSR Transaction. Based on NMIC's total statutory capital of $524 million (including contingency reserves) as of December 31, 2017, NMIC's RTC ratio was 14.0:1. Re One had total statutory capital of $34 million as of December 31, 2017, with a RTC ratio of 0.8:1. We continuously monitor our compliance with state capital requirements.\nIn March 2017, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) upgraded its financial strength rating from \"Ba2\" to \"Ba1\" for NMIC. At that time, Moody's also upgraded its rating of NMIH's $150 million Term Loan from \"B2\" to \"B1.\" In August 2017, Moody's re-affirmed its \"Ba1\" financial strength rating for NMIC and its B1 rating of NMIH's $150 million Term Loan and upgraded the outlook for both ratings from \"stable\" to \"positive.\" In July 2017, S&P re-affirmed its \"BBB-\" financial strength and long-term counter-party credit ratings on NMIC and its \"BB-\" long-term counter-party credit rating on NMIH and upgraded the outlook for both ratings to \"positive.\"\nCompetition\nThe MI industry is highly competitive and currently consists of six private mortgage insurers, including NMIC, as well as public MIs like the FHA and the VA. Private MI companies compete based on service, customer relationships, underwriting and other factors, including price. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business - Overview of Residential Mortgage Finance and the Role of the Private MI Industry in the Current Operating Environment - Competition,\" above. We expect the MI market to remain competitive, with pressure for industry participants to grow or maintain their market share.\nThe private MI industry overall competes more broadly with public MIs who significantly increased their presence in the MI market following the financial crisis. Although there has been broad policy consensus toward the need for private capital to play a larger role and government credit risk to be reduced in the U.S. housing finance system, it remains difficult to predict whether the combined market share of public MIs will recede to historical levels. A range of factors influence a lender's decision to choose private over public MI, including among others, premium rates and other charges, loan eligibility requirements, cancelability, loan size limits and the relative ease of use of private MI products compared to public MI alternatives.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated statements of operations\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>(In Thousands, except for share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>16,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(693\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>182,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance claims and claims expenses\n</td> <td>5,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting and operating expenses\n</td> <td>106,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>112,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain from change in fair value of warrant liability\n</td> <td>(4,105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,900\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(13,528\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>52,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,793\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>30,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,549\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,793\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss ratio(1)\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense ratio(2)\n</td> <td>64.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>67.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Loss ratio is calculated by dividing the provision for insurance claims and claims expenses by net premiums earned.\n(2) Expense ratio is calculated by dividing other underwriting and operating expenses by net premiums earned.\n(3) The 2016 prior period consolidated statements of operations has been revised. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2, Summary of Accounting Principles - Immaterial Correction of Prior Period Amounts,\" for further details.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net premiums earned totaled $165.7 million compared to $110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of net premiums earned of $55.2 million in 2017 was primarily due to the growth of our IIF and increased monthly policy production, partially offset by the decreases in single premium NIW and earnings from cancellations, and the impact of cessions under the 2017 ILN transaction and 2016 QSR Transaction. The $65.0 million increase in net premiums earned in 2016 was primarily due to the growth of our IIF, increased single premium NIW production and higher earnings from cancellations, partially offset by the effect of the 2016 QSR Transaction.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net investment income was $16.3 million compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in both periods was due to an increase in the size of and improved yields on our total investment portfolio.\nExpenses\nWe recognize insurance claims and claims expenses in connection with the loss experience of our insured portfolio and incur other underwriting and operating expenses, including employee compensation and benefits, policy acquisition costs, and technology, professional services and facilities expenses, in connection with the development and operation of our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, insurance claims and claims expenses were $5.3 million compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Insurance claims and claims expenses increased $2.9 million in 2017, as a result of new defaults on insured loans in areas impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires, as well as an increase in the overall number of policies in our portfolio and aging of earlier book years, offset by the partial release of reserves related to prior year defaults. Insurance claims and claims expenses increased $1.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in the overall number of policies in our portfolio and aging of earlier book years.\nUnderwriting and operating expenses were $107.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $93.2 million and $80.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Employee compensation accounts for the majority of our operating expenses. We increased the size of our workforce from 243 employees at December 31, 2015 to 276 employees at December 31, 2016 and to 299 employees at December 31, 2017 to support the growth of our business, particularly our sales and operating functions. Underwriting and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 also reflect $4.9 million of operating expenses related to the 2017 ILN Transaction and amendment of our Credit Agreement.\nInterest expense was $13.5 million, $14.8 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense declined in 2017 compared to 2016 in connection with the amendment of our Credit Agreement completed in February 2017, which among other items, reduced the interest spread payable on the Term Loan. The interest expense reduction was partially offset by a rise in the underlying LIBOR rate during 2017. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5, Term Loan.\" Interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting a full year of interest expense for the Term Loan, which we established in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nIncome tax expense was $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to income tax benefit of $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and no income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2015. The fluctuation of our income taxes is the result of significant events during each of periods presented. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $13.6 million primarily due to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a one-time non-cash benefit of $58.8 million related to the release of the valuation allowance recorded against our federal and certain state net deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not record an income tax expense due to the recognition of a valuation allowance against our federal and state net deferred tax assets.

See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2, Summary of Accounting Principles - Immaterial Correction of Prior Period Amounts,\" for further details.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $735.1 million in cash and investments, including $51.0 million held at NMIH. The increase in cash and investments from year-end 2016 primarily relates to cash generated from operations.\nNet deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) were $37.9 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $30.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by growth in the number of policies written during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the deferment of certain costs associated with the origination of those policies, partially offset by the amortization of previously deferred acquisition costs and the capitalization of ceding commissions associated with the 2016 QSR Transaction during the period.\nPremiums receivable increased to $25.2 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $13.7 million as of December 31, 2016 due to growth in the number of monthly policies in force.\nDeferred tax asset, net decreased to $19.9 million as of December 31, 2017, from $51.4 million at December 31, 2016 due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances at the reduced statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards during the period. For further information regarding income taxes and their impact on our results of operations and financial position, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11, Income Taxes.\"\nUnearned premiums increased $10.3 million to $163.2 million as of December 31, 2017, primarily due to single premium policy origination during the period, offset by the amortization through earnings of existing unearned premiums in accordance with the expiration of risk on the related policies and the cancellation of other single premium policies.\nReserve for insurance claims and claims expenses increased $5.8 million to $8.8 million at December 31, 2017, due to an increase in our default inventory at December 31, 2017. See \"- Insurance Claims and Claims Expenses,\" above for further details.\nWarrant liability increased to $7.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $3.4 million at December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in our stock price during the year.\nReinsurance funds withheld was $34.1 million as of December 31, 2017, representing the net of our ceded reinsurance premiums written, less our profit and ceding commission receivables related to the 2016 QSR Transaction. The increase in reinsurance\nfunds withheld of $3.5 million from December 31, 2016, was a result of increased ceded premiums written. See, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6, Reinsurance.\"\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated cash flows\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(93,072\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,792\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(230,165\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(3,241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,723\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $67.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily caused by increased operating expenses in connection with employee compensation and benefits costs and higher claims paid due to an increase in our default inventory offset by growth in direct premiums written. The increase in cash generated from operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the higher premiums written offset by increased operating expenses associated with the hiring of management and staff personnel and costs for contract and professional services.\nCash used in investing activities for the periods presented was driven by the purchase of fixed and short-term maturities during those periods.\nCash used in financing activities was $3.2 million and $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, and primarily relates to taxes paid on the net share settlement of equity awards for certain employees. Cash provided by financing activities was $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and primarily relates to proceeds from the Term Loan which we established in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nHolding Company Liquidity and Capital Resources\nNMIH serves as the holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. NMIH's principal liquidity demands include funds for: (i) payment of certain corporate expenses; (ii) payment of certain reimbursable expenses of its insurance subsidiaries; (iii) payment of principal and interest related to the Term Loan; (iv) tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service; (v) capital support for its subsidiaries; and (vi) payment of dividends, if any, on its common stock. NMIH is not subject to any limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations, such as NMIH, that are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware corporation law provides that dividends are only payable out of a corporation's surplus or recent net profits (subject to certain limitations).\nAs of December 31, 2017, NMIH had $51.0 million of cash and investments. NMIH's principal source of net cash is investment income and in the future could include dividends from NMIC, if available and permitted under law and by the GSEs.\nNMIH has entered into tax and expense-sharing agreements with its subsidiaries which have been approved by the Wisconsin OCI, but such approval may be changed or revoked at any time. With the Wisconsin OCI's approval, NMIH began allocating the interest expense on its Term Loan to NMIC in the first quarter of 2017, consistent with the benefits NMIC received when NMIH down-streamed the loan proceeds to NMIC.\nNMIC's ability to pay dividends to NMIH is subject to insurance department notice or approval. Under Wisconsin law, NMIC may pay dividends up to specified levels (i.e., \"ordinary\" dividends) with 30 days' prior notice to the Wisconsin OCI. Dividends in larger amounts, or \"extraordinary\" dividends, are subject to the Wisconsin OCI's prior approval. Under Wisconsin insurance laws, an extraordinary dividend is defined as any payment or distribution that together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer's statutory policyholders' surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) adjusted statutory net income for the 12-month period ending the preceding December 31. NMIC has never paid any dividends to NMIH. NMIC reported a statutory net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and currently cannot pay any dividends to NMIH through December 31, 2018 without the prior approval of the Wisconsin OCI. Certain other states in which NMIC is licensed also have statutes or regulations that restrict its ability to pay dividends.\nNMIC's capital needs depend on many factors including its ability to successfully write new business, establish premium rates at levels sufficient to cover claims and operating costs and meet minimum required asset thresholds under the PMIERs and state capital requirements. NMIC's capital needs also depend on its decision to access the reinsurance markets. NMIH may require liquidity to fund the capital needs of its insurance subsidiaries.\nIn November 2015, NMIH entered into the Credit Agreement for the Term Loan. On February 10, 2017, NMIH amended the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 1) to reduce the interest rate and extend the maturity date of the Term Loan from November 10, 2018 to November 10, 2019. The amended Term Loan bears interest at the Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement and subject to a 1.00% floor, plus an annual margin rate of 6.75%, payable monthly or quarterly based on our interest rate election. On October 25, 2017, NMIH further amended the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 2) to remove a covenant that required NMIH to maintain liquidity (as defined therein) in an aggregate amount no less than all remaining interest payments due under the Term Loan. As modified by Amendment No. 2, the Credit Agreement retains the requirement that NMIH maintain liquidity in an aggregate amount no less than the sum of all remaining principal amortization payments due under the Term Loan, excluding principal scheduled to be paid on its maturity date, determined to be $2.6 million as of December 31, 2017. The Credit Agreement contains other restrictive covenants and required financial ratios and tests (which were not modified by Amendments No.1 or No.2) that we are required to meet or maintain. The current covenants include, but are not limited to the following: a maximum debt-to-total capitalization ratio (as defined therein) of 35%, maximum RTC ratio of 22.0:1.0, minimum liquidity (as modified by Amendment No. 2 and defined therein), compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements (subject to any GSE-approved waivers), and minimum shareholders' equity requirements.\nConsolidated Investment Portfolio\nOur primary objectives with respect to our investment portfolio are to preserve capital and generate investment income, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to cover our operating needs. We aim to achieve diversification by type, quality, maturity, and industry. We have adopted an investment policy that defines, among other things, eligible and ineligible investments, concentration limits for asset types, industry sectors, single issuers, and certain credit ratings, and benchmarks for asset duration.\nSubstantially all of our investment portfolio is held in fixed maturity instruments. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of our investment portfolio was $715.9 million. We also had an additional $19.2 million of cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2017. Pre-tax book yield on the portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 2.3%. The book yield is calculated as period-to-date net investment income divided by average amortized cost of the investment portfolio. Yield on the investment portfolio is likely to change over time based on movements in interest rates, the duration or mix of our investment portfolio and other factors.\nThe following tables present a breakdown of our investment portfolio and cash and cash equivalents by investment type and credit rating: Table 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of portfolio's fair value\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate debt securities\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government agencies\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal debt securities\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ratings of our investment portfolio were:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment portfolio ratings at fair value\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAA\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA(1)\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A(1)\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB(1)\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Include +/- ratings.\nThe ratings above are provided by one or more of: Moody's, S&P and Fitch Ratings. If three ratings are available, we assign\nthe middle rating for classification purposes, otherwise we assign the lowest rating.\nOther-than-Temporary Impairment (OTTI)\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we held no other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) securities, and as of December 31, 2015, we held one OTTI security. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized OTTI losses in earnings of $144 thousand on a single security with an unfavorable recovery forecast. The impaired security was liquidated during the year. There were no credit losses recognized in earnings for which a portion of an OTTI loss was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized an OTTI loss in earnings of $89 thousand on a single security where we expected a planned sale would result in a loss. The impaired security was liquidated in 2016.\nTaxes\nWe are a U.S. taxpayer and are subject to a statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 35% for for all prior years through December 31, 2017. We will be subject to a statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% for the years ending December 31, 2018 and all future periods. Our holding company files a consolidated U.S. federal and various state income tax returns on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries.\nProvisional amounts\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. We have not completed our full assessment of the tax effects of the enactment of the Act on our December 31, 2017 balances; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects on our deferred tax balances. We recognized a $13.6 million income tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2017 for the items we could reasonably estimate primarily related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We are still analyzing the Act and refining our calculation on deferred our tax asset related to share-based compensation, which could affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to further increases or decreases to our deferred tax amounts. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Act expanded the number of individuals whose compensation is subject to a $1 million cap on tax deductibility and includes performance-based compensation in the calculation. As a result, the Company recorded a provisional amount to reduce the future tax benefit related to share-based compensation. We will continue to make and refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. In addition, our estimates may also be affected as we gain a more thorough understanding of the tax law.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) on December 23, 2017. SAB 118 provides a one-year measurement period from a registrant's reporting period that includes the Act's enactment date to allow the registrant sufficient time to obtain, prepare and analyze information to complete the accounting required under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740.\nThe ultimate impact of the Act on our reported results in fiscal 2017 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided herein, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and other actions we may take as a result of the Act differently from that presently contemplated.\nOur effective income tax rate on our pre-tax income was 58.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective income tax rate on our pre-tax loss was (459.0)% and 0.0% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The difference between our statutory tax rate and our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to tax expense of $13.6 million associated with the enactment of the Act, partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.3 million from excess share-based compensation for vested restricted stock units (RSUs) and exercised stock options. The difference between our statutory tax rate and our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the release of the valuation allowance in 2016. Starting in 2018, we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate will approximate the statutory corporate tax rates.\nSince inception and prior to December 31, 2016, we recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, and, as such, we generally did not record a benefit associated with the losses incurred in prior periods or other income tax benefits. At December 31, 2016, after weighing applicable evidence, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that our deferred tax asset would be realized. As a result, as of December 31, 2016, we released the valuation allowance on federal and certain state deferred tax assets. We continued to record a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets, primarily related to state net operating losses generated by NMIH that we do not expect to be utilized. NMIH operates at a loss and continues to only generate revenue from its investment portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the positive evidence that weighed in favor of releasing the valuation allowance and ultimately outweighed the negative evidence against releasing the allowance included:\n \u2022 our net operating loss carryforwards were expected to be fully utilized by 2018; \n \u2022 our other deferred tax assets were based on known recognition schedules and our expectation was that the majority would either reverse in the next three years or were related to deferred tax liabilities; \n \u2022 our significant unearned premium balance which represents future revenue to be earned over the policies' lives; \n \u2022 the substantial growth in our IIF driving the increase in net premiums; \n \u2022 our positive earnings trends from quarterly and annual increases in revenue; \n \u2022 our taxable income in 2016 and our expected taxable income in future years; and \n \u2022 our expectation that we will be in a cumulative profit in a three-year period in 2017.  The primary negative evidence that was considered was our cumulative losses in recent years. Although ASC 740 does not define the term or the length of time to consider when calculating the cumulative loss, practice and interpretations suggest that the guideline, not a \"bright line\", is to aggregate the pretax results as adjusted for permanent items for three years (i.e., the current and the two preceding years).\nAt December 31, 2016, we concluded that positive evidence of sufficient quantity and quality outweighed negative evidence and supported our conclusion that it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our federal and certain state deferred tax assets. The reversal of our beginning-of-the-year valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets (resulting from a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets in future years) is consistent with the requirements of ASC 740-10-45-20. At December 31, 2016, we released the valuation allowance on federal and certain state deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance continued to be recorded against net state deferred tax assets, primarily related to state net operating losses by NMIH that we do not expect to be utilized. NMIH operates at a loss and currently only generates revenue from its investment portfolio.\nWe have examined the results through December 31, 2017, and performed a review of future expectations, which continue to support the conclusion that it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our federal and certain state deferred tax assets. We also concluded to continue to apply a valuation allowance to the net state deferred tax assets, primarily related to state net operating losses by NMIH that we do not expect to be utilized.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $93.3 million which expires from 2030 to 2037, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $89.1 million, which expire in varying amounts during the years 2031 to 2037. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes annual limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards if it experiences an \"ownership change.\" As a result of the acquisition of our insurance subsidiaries in 2012, $7.3 million of NOLs were subject to annual limitations of $0.8 million through 2016, and $0.3 million, thereafter, through 2029.\nThere is a tax sharing agreement between NMIH and its subsidiaries, dated August 23, 2012 and amended on September 1, 2016. Under this agreement, each of the parties mutually agreed to file a consolidated federal income tax return for 2012 and subsequent tax years, with NMIH as the direct tax filer. The tax liability of each subsidiary that is party to the agreement is limited to the amount of the liability it would incur if it filed separate returns.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017. In connection with the 2017 ILN Transaction, we have certain future contractual commitments to Oaktown Re, a special purpose VIE that is not consolidated in our financial results. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2, Summary of Accounting Principles - Variable interest entity\" and \"Note 6, Reinsurance.\"\nContractual obligations at December 31, 2017 are summarized in the table that follows.\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>1,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>3,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities reflected on the registrant's balance sheet under GAAP\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Long-term debt relates to our $150 million Credit Agreement and includes future interest payments using the minimum interest rate in effect at December 31, 2017 of 7.75%.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Because the use of estimates is inherent in GAAP, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. A summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below.\nInsurance Premium Revenue Recognition\nPremiums for primary mortgage insurance policies may be paid in a single payment at origination (single premium), on a monthly installment basis (monthly premium) or on an annual installment basis (annual premium), with such election and payment type fixed at policy inception. Premiums written at origination for single premium policies are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and amortized into earnings over the estimated policy life in accordance with the anticipated expiration of risk. Monthly premiums are recognized as revenue in the month billed as coverage is effective. Annual premiums are initially deferred and earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. Premiums written on pool transactions are earned over the period that coverage is provided. Upon cancellation of a policy, all remaining non-refundable deferred and unearned premium is immediately earned, and any refundable premium is returned to the policyholder. Premiums returned to the policyholder are recorded as a reduction of written and earned premiums in the paid period.\nReserve for Claims and Claims Expenses\nConsistent with industry practice, we establish reserves for claims based on our best estimate of ultimate claim costs for defaulted loans using the general principles contained in ASC 944, Financial Services - Insurance (ASC 944). We establish reserves for loans that have been in default for at least 60 days. Reserves for claims and allocated claims expenses, referred to as case reserves, are established when we are notified of defaults by loan servicers. Additional claims reserves, referred to as IBNR reserves, are established for loans that we estimate (based on actuarial review) have been in default for at least 60 days, but have not yet been reported to us as such by servicers. We also establish reserves for unallocated claims expenses not associated with specific claims. Claims expenses represent the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees, as well as other general expenses of administering the claims settlement process.\nThe establishment of claims and claims expense reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. Reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in default that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as claim frequency, and the amount of the claim payment expected to be paid on each such loan in default, which is\nreferred to as claim severity. Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical observed experience regarding certain loan factors, such as age of the default, size of the loan and LTV ratios, and are strongly influenced by prevailing economic conditions, such as mortgage rates, trends in unemployment and house price appreciation. We conduct an annual actuarial review to evaluate, and, if necessary, update these assumptions.\nInvestments\nWe have designated our investment portfolio as available-for-sale and report it at fair value. The related unrealized gains and losses, after considering the related tax expense or benefit, are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity. Net realized investment gains and losses are reported in income based on specific identification of securities sold, and are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nWe measure fair value and classify invested assets in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three \"levels\" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments.\"\nEach fiscal quarter, we evaluate our investments to determine whether declines in fair value below amortized cost were considered other-than-temporary in accordance with applicable guidance. Under current guidance, a debt security impairment is deemed other-than-temporary if (i) we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery or (ii) we do not expect to collect cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. In evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 our intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery; \n \u2022 severity and duration of the decline in fair value; \n \u2022 the financial condition of the issuer; \n \u2022 the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; \n \u2022 recent credit downgrades of the applicable security or the issuer below investment grade; and \n \u2022 adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or a geographic area. \nPremium Deficiency Reserve\nWe perform a premium deficiency calculation each fiscal quarter using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date. Per ASC 944, a premium deficiency reserve shall be recognized if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses, expected dividends to policyholders, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds future premiums, existing reserves and anticipated investment income. The calculation of premium deficiency reserves requires the use of significant judgment and estimates to determine the present value of future premiums and present value of expected claims and expenses on our business. The present value of future premiums relies on, among other things, assumptions about persistency and repayment patterns on underlying loans. The present value of expected claims and expenses depends on assumptions relating to severity of claims, claim rates on current defaults and expected defaults in future periods. These assumptions may also include an estimate of expected rescission activity. Assumptions used in calculating premium deficiency reserves can be affected by volatility in the current housing and mortgage lending industries. To the extent premium patterns and actual claim experience differ from the assumptions used in calculating a premium deficiency reserve, the differences between the actual results and our estimate will affect future period earnings. In considering the potential sensitivity of the factors underlying our best estimate of premium deficiency reserves, it is possible that even a relatively small change in estimated claim rate or a relatively small percentage change in estimated claim amount could have a significant impact on establishing a premium deficiency reserve, should one be needed, and, correspondingly, on our operating results.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nCosts directly associated with the successful acquisition of mortgage insurance policies, consisting of certain selling expenses and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses, are initially deferred and reported as DAC. DAC is reviewed periodically to determine that it does not exceed recoverable amounts and is adjusted as appropriate for policy cancellations to be consistent with our revenue recognition policy. We estimate the rate of amortization to reflect actual experience and any changes to persistency or loss development. For each book year of business, these costs are amortized to expense in proportion to estimated gross profits over the estimated life of the policies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the expected future tax effects of temporary differences at the enacted tax rates applicable for the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements that would result in future increases or decreases in taxes owed on a cash basis as compared to amounts already recognized as tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Changes in tax laws, rates, regulations and policies, or the final determination of tax audits or examinations, could materially affect our tax estimates.\nWe are required to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We assess our need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. In the course of our review, we assess all available evidence, both positive and negative, including future sources of income, tax planning strategies, future contractual cash flows and reversing temporary differences, and are required to exercise judgment and make assumptions in this regard.\nOur provision for income taxes for interim financial periods is based on an estimate of our annual effective tax rate for the full year. When estimating our full year effective tax rate, we adjust our forecasted pre-tax income for gains and losses on our investments, changes in the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, changes in our beginning of year valuation allowance, and other adjustments. The impact of these items is accounted for discretely at the applicable federal tax rate.\nWarrants\nWe account for warrants to purchase our common shares in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC 815-40 Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. Our outstanding warrants may be settled by us using either (i) a physical settlement method or (ii) cashless exercise, where shares that are issued upon exercise of the warrants are reduced to cover the cost of the exercise, in lieu of the holder remitting a cash payment of the exercise price. The warrants expire, and are not exercisable after the 10th anniversary of the date they were issued. The exercise price and the number of warrants are subject to anti-dilution provisions whereby the existing exercise price is adjusted downward, and the number of warrants increased, for events that may not be dilutive. The adjustment may be in excess of any dilution suffered. As a result, the warrants are classified as a liability. We revalue the warrants at the end of each reporting period, and any change in fair value is reported in the statements of operations in the period in which the change occurred. We calculate the fair value of the warrants using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model in combination with a binomial model. We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the pricing protection features within the warrants. Variables in the model include the fair value of the stock, risk-free rate of return, dividend yield, expected life and expected volatility of the Company's stock price.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which addresses accounting for share-based awards and recognition of compensation expense, measured using grant date fair value, over the requisite service or performance period of the award. Share-based compensation includes RSUs and stock option grants under the NMI Holdings, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (2012 Plan) and the NMI Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Amended 2014 Plan), which amended and restated the NMI Holdings, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2014 Plan). We calculate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which takes into account various subjective assumptions. Key assumptions used in the model include the expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate, as well as the expected option term, giving consideration to the contractual terms of any award and the effects of expected exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. RSU grants to employees may contain a service condition, market and service condition or performance and service condition. RSU grants to employees with a service or a performance condition and RSU grants to non-employee directors are valued at our stock price on the date of grant less the present value of anticipated dividends. The fair value of RSU grants to employees with a market condition are determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of grant.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included below in Item 8 of this report and the Risk Factors included above in Part I, Item 1A of this report. In addition, investors should review the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" above.\nOverview\nWe provide private MI through our wholly owned insurance subsidiaries NMIC and Re One. NMIC and Re One are domiciled in Wisconsin and principally regulated by the Wisconsin OCI. NMIC is our primary insurance subsidiary, and is approved as an MI provider by the GSEs and is licensed to write coverage in all 50 states and D.C. Re One provides statutorily required reinsurance to NMIC on insured loans with coverage levels in excess of 25% after giving effect to third-party reinsurance. Our subsidiary, NMIS, provides outsourced loan review services to mortgage loan originators.\nMI protects lenders and investors from default-related losses on a portion of the unpaid principal balance of a covered mortgage. MI plays a critical role in the U.S. housing market by mitigating mortgage credit risk and facilitating the secondary market sale of high-LTV (i.e. above 80%) residential loans to the GSEs, who are otherwise restricted by their charters from purchasing or guaranteeing high-LTV mortgages that are not covered by certain credit protections. Such credit protection and secondary market sales allow lenders to increase their capacity for mortgage commitments and expand financing access to existing and prospective homeowners.\nNMIH, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in May 2011, and we began start-up operations in 2012 and wrote our first MI policy in 2013. Since formation, we have sought to establish customer relationships with a broad group of mortgage lenders and build a diversified, high-quality insured portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, we had master policies with 1,267 customers, including national and regional mortgage banks, money center banks, credit unions, community banks, builder-owned mortgage lenders, internet-sourced lenders and other non-bank lenders. We had total IIF of $51.7 billion and gross RIF of $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to total IIF of $35.8 billion and gross RIF of $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2016, and total IIF of $19.1 billion and gross RIF of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2015. Included in our total IIF as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $48.5 billion, $32.2 billion and $14.8 billion of primary IIF, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, our gross primary RIF was $11.8 billion, compared to $7.8 billion and $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated NIW of $21.6 billion, compared to $21.2 billion and $12.4 billion for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had 299 full-time employees.\nWe believe that our success in acquiring a large and diverse group of lender customers and growing a portfolio of high-quality IIF traces to our founding principles, whereby we aim to help qualified individuals achieve the dream of homeownership, ensure that we remain a strong and credible counterparty, deliver a unique customer service experience, establish a differentiated risk management approach that emphasizes the individual underwriting review or validation of the vast majority of the loans we insure, and foster a culture of collaboration and excellence that helps us attract and retain experienced industry leaders.\nOur strategy is to continue to build on our position in the private MI market, expand our customer base and grow our insured portfolio of high-quality residential loans by focusing on long-term customer relationships, disciplined and proactive risk selection and pricing, fair and transparent claims payment practices, responsive customer service, financial strength and profitability.\nOur common stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol \"NMIH.\"\nWe discuss below our results of operations for the periods presented, as well as the conditions and trends that have impacted or are expected to impact our business, including customer development, new business writings, the composition of our insurance portfolio and other factors that we expect to impact our results.\nConditions and Trends Impacting Our Business\nCustomer Development\nWe have important relationships with customers across all categories and allocation profiles, including National Accounts and Regional Accounts, and centralized and decentralized lenders. Our sales and marketing efforts are broadly focused on expanding our presence with existing customers and activating new customer relationships. We consider an activation to be the point at which we have signed a Master Policy, established IT connectivity and generated a first application or first NIW from a customer. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we activated 127 lenders, compared to 173 and 247 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also continued to expand our business with existing customers, deepening our existing relationships and capturing what we believe to be an increasing portion of their annual MI volume. At December 31, 2017, we had 1,267 Master Policies and 841 active customer relationships, compared to 1,131 and 715 as of December 31, 2016 and 964 and 524 as of December 31, 2015.\nNew Insurance Written, Insurance In Force and Risk In Force\nNIW is the aggregate unpaid principal balance of mortgages underpinning new policies written during a given period. Our NIW is affected by the overall size of the mortgage origination market and the volume of high-LTV mortgage originations, which tend to be generated to a greater extent in purchase originations as compared to refinancings. Our NIW is also affected by the percentage of such high-LTV originations covered by private versus public MI or other alternative credit enhancement structures and our share of the private MI market. NIW, together with persistency, drives our IIF. IIF is the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the mortgages we insure, as reported to us by servicers at a given date, and represents the sum total of NIW from all prior periods less principal payments on insured mortgages and policy cancellations (including for prepayment, nonpayment of premiums, coverage rescission and claim payments). RIF is related to IIF and represents the aggregate amount of coverage we provide on all outstanding policies at a given date. RIF is calculated as the sum total of the coverage percentage of each individual policy in our portfolio applied to the unpaid principal balance of such insured mortgage. RIF is affected by IIF and the LTV profile of our insured mortgages, with lower LTV loans generally having a lower coverage percentage and higher LTV loans having a higher coverage percentage. Gross RIF represents RIF before consideration of reinsurance. Net RIF is gross RIF net of ceded reinsurance.\nNet Premiums Written and Net Premiums Earned\nWe set our premium rates on individual policies based on the risk characteristics of the underlying mortgage loans and borrowers, and in accordance with our filed rates and applicable rating rules.\nPremiums are generally fixed over the estimated life of the underlying loans. Net premiums written are equal to gross premiums written minus ceded premiums written under our reinsurance arrangements and less premium refunds. As a result, net premiums written are generally influenced by:\n \u2022 NIW; \n \u2022 premium rates and the mix of premium payment type, which are either single, monthly or annual premiums, as described below; \n \u2022 cancellation rates of our insurance policies, which are impacted by payments or prepayments on mortgages, refinancings (which are affected by prevailing mortgage interest rates as compared to interest rates on loans underpinning our in force policies), levels of claims payments and home prices; \n \u2022 cession of premiums under third-party reinsurance arrangements.  Premiums are paid either by the borrower (BPMI) or the lender (LPMI) in a single payment at origination (single premium), on a monthly installment basis (monthly premium) or on an annual installment basis (annual premium). Our net premiums written will differ from our net premiums earned due to policy payment type. For single premiums, we receive a single premium payment at origination, which is initially recorded as unearned premium and earned over the estimated life of the policy. A majority of our single premium policies in force as of December 31, 2017 were non-refundable under most cancellation scenarios. If non-refundable single premium policies are canceled, we immediately recognize the remaining unearned premium balances as earned premium revenue. Monthly premiums are recognized in the month billed and when the coverage is effective. Annual premiums are earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. Substantially all of our policies provide for either single or monthly premiums.\nThe percentage of IIF that remains on our books after any 12-month period is defined as our persistency rate. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, higher persistency rates can have a significant impact on our net premiums earned and profitability. Generally, faster speeds of mortgage prepayment lead to lower persistency. Prepayment speeds and the relative mix of business between single and monthly premium policies also impact our profitability. Our premium rates include\ncertain assumptions regarding repayment or prepayment speeds of the mortgages underlying our policies. Because premiums are paid at origination on single premium policies and substantially all of our single premium policies are non-refundable on cancellation, assuming all other factors remain constant, if single premium loans are prepaid earlier than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to increase and, if loans are repaid slower than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to decrease. By contrast, if monthly premium loans are repaid earlier than anticipated, we do not earn any more premium with respect to those loans and, unless we replace the repaid monthly premium loan with a new loan, our profitability is likely to decline.\nEffect of reinsurance on our results\nWe utilize third-party reinsurance to actively manage our risk, ensure PMIERs compliance and support the growth of our business. We currently have both quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements in place, which impact our results of operations and regulatory capital and PMIERs asset positions. Under a quota share reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer receives a premium in exchange for covering an agreed-upon portion of incurred losses. Such a quota share arrangement reduces net premiums written and earned and also reduces net RIF, providing capital relief to the ceding insurance company and reducing incurred claims in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement. In addition, reinsurers typically pay ceding commissions as part of quota share transactions, which offset the ceding company's acquisition and underwriting expenses. Certain quota share agreements include profit commissions that are earned based on loss performance and serve to reduce ceded premiums. Under an excess-of-loss agreement, the ceding insurer is typically responsible for losses up to an agreed-upon threshold and the reinsurer then provides coverage in excess of such threshold up to a maximum agreed-upon limit. In general, there are no ceding commissions under excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements. We expect to continue to evaluate reinsurance opportunities in the normal course of business.\nQuota share reinsurance\nNMIC entered into the 2016 QSR Transaction in September 2016. Under the terms of the 2016 QSR Transaction, NMIC (1) ceded 100% of the risk relating to our pool agreement with Fannie Mae, (2) ceded 25% of existing risk written on eligible policies as of August 31, 2016 and (3) ceded 25% of the risk relating to eligible primary insurance policies written between September 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claims expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 60% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.\nNMIC entered into the 2018 QSR Transaction, which took effect January 1, 2018. Under the 2018 QSR Transaction, NMIC agrees to cede 25% of its eligible policies written in 2018 and 20% to 30% (such amount to be determined by NMIC at its sole election by December 1, 2018) of eligible policies written in 2019, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claims expenses on covered policies, a 20% ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 61% that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims.\nExcess-of-loss reinsurance\nIn May 2017, NMIC secured $211.3 million of aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage at inception for an existing portfolio of MI policies written from 2013 through December 31, 2016, through a mortgage insurance-linked notes offering by Oaktown Re. The reinsurance coverage amount under the terms of the 2017 ILN Transaction decreases from $211.3 million at inception over a ten-year period as the underlying covered mortgages amortize and/or are repaid, and was $177 million as of December 31, 2017. For the reinsurance coverage period, NMIC will retain the first layer of $126.8 million of aggregate losses and Oaktown Re will then provide a second layer of coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. NMIC retains losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount.\nSee, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6, Reinsurance\" for further discussion of these third-party reinsurance arrangements.\nPortfolio Data\nThe following table presents primary and pool NIW and IIF as of the dates and for the periods indicated. Unless otherwise noted, the tables below do not include the effects of our third-party reinsurance arrangements described above.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, primary NIW increased 2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily because of the growth in our monthly policy volume tied to increased penetration of existing customer accounts and new customer account activations, offset by a reduction in our single policy production tied to actions we initiated to reduce the concentration of single policies in our product mix. Primary NIW increased 71% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily because of the growth within and an expansion of our customer base.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, 81% of our NIW related to monthly premium policies, as compared to 67% and 48% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, monthly premium policies accounted for 69% of our primary IIF, as compared to 60% at December 31, 2016 and 47% at December 31, 2015. We expect the break-down of monthly premium policies and single premium policies (which we refer to as \"mix\") in our primary IIF to continue to trend toward our current NIW mix over time. Our total IIF at December 31, 2017 increased 44% compared to December 31, 2016, which in turn increased 88% compared to December 31, 2015, primarily because of the NIW we generated between such measurement dates and higher persistency of our policies in force.\nThe following table presents net premiums written and earned for the periods indicated.\n\n(1) Net premiums written and earned are reported net of reinsurance and premium refunds.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net premiums written and earned increased 29% and 50%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net premiums written is due to the growth of our IIF and increased monthly policy production, partially offset by a decrease in single premium NIW. The trend in net premiums written was also impacted by the inception of the 2016 QSR Transaction in September 2016, which entailed an initial cession of $35 million of premiums written on all covered singles policies written prior to the transaction effective date and had the effect of reducing net premiums written in 2016 by a like amount. The increase in net premiums earned is due to the growth of our IIF and increased monthly policy production, partially offset by decreases in our single premium NIW and earnings from cancellations, and the impact of cessions under the 2017 ILN transaction and 2016 QSR Transaction.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net premiums written and earned increased 18% and 143%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increases in net premiums written and earned are primarily due to the growth of our IIF and increased NIW production, partially offset by ceded premiums related to the 2016 QSR Transaction, which entailed an initial cession of premiums written on all covered singles policies written prior to the transaction effective date and introduced partial cessions of premiums written and earned on covered policies thereafter.\nPool premiums written and earned for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, were $3.8 million, $4.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively, before giving effect to the 2016 QSR Transaction, under which all of our written and earned pool premiums have been ceded.\nPortfolio Statistics\nUnless otherwise noted, the portfolio statistics tables presented below do not include the effects of our third-party reinsurance arrangements described above. The table below highlights trends in our primary portfolio as of the dates and for the periods indicated.\n\n(1) Reported as of the end of the period.\n(2) Calculated as end of period RIF divided by IIF.\nThe table below presents a summary of the change in total primary IIF for the dates and periods indicated.\n\nWe consider a \"book\" to be a collective pool of policies insured during a particular period, normally a calendar year. In general, the majority of underwriting profit, calculated as earned premium revenue minus claims and underwriting and operating expenses, generated by a particular book year emerges in the years immediately following origination. This pattern generally occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years following origination, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments), and by increasing losses.\nThe table below reflects a summary of our primary IIF and RIF by book year as of the dates indicated.\n\nWe utilize certain risk principles that form the basis of how we underwrite and originate primary NIW. We manage our portfolio credit risk by using several loan eligibility matrices which prescribe the maximum LTV, minimum borrower FICO score, maximum borrower DTI ratio, maximum loan size, property type, loan type, loan term and occupancy status of loans that we will insure. Our loan eligibility matrices, as well as all of our detailed underwriting guidelines, are contained in our Underwriting Guideline Manual that is publicly available on our website. Our eligibility criteria and underwriting guidelines are designed to mitigate the layered risk inherent in a single insurance policy. \"Layered risk\" refers to the accumulation of borrower, loan and property risk. For example, we have higher credit score and lower maximum allowed LTV requirements for investor-owned properties, compared to owner-occupied properties. We monitor the concentrations of various risk attributes in our insurance portfolio, which may change over time, in part, as a result of regional conditions or public policy shifts.\nThe tables below present our primary NIW by FICO, LTV and purchase/refinance mix for the periods indicated. We calculate the LTV of a loan as the percentage of the original loan amount to the original purchase value of the property securing the loan.\n\n\n\nThe tables below present our total primary IIF and RIF by FICO and LTV and total primary RIF by loan type as of the dates indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows selected primary portfolio statistics, by book year, as of December 31, 2017.\n\n (1) The ratio of total claims incurred (paid and reserved) divided by cumulative premiums earned, net of reinsurance. \n (2) The sum of the number of claims paid ever to date and number of loans in default as of the end of the period divided by policies ever in force. \nGeographic Dispersion\nThe following table shows the distribution by state of our primary RIF as of the periods indicated. As of December 31, 2017, our RIF continues to be relatively more concentrated in California, primarily as a result of the size of the California mortgage market relative to the rest of the country and the location and timing of our acquisition of new customers.\n\nInsurance Claims and Claims Expenses\nInsurance claims and claims expenses incurred represent estimated future payments on newly defaulted insured loans and any change in our claim estimates for previously existing defaults. Claims incurred is generally affected by a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 future macroeconomic factors, including unemployment, which affects the likelihood that borrowers may default on their loans, and rising interest rates, which tend to increase persistency, thereby extending the average life of our insured portfolio and increasing expected future claims; \n \u2022 changes in housing values, as such changes may affect loss mitigation opportunities on loans in default, as well as borrowers' behaviors and willingness to default if the values of their homes are below or perceived to be below their mortgage balances; \n \u2022 borrowers' FICO scores, with lower FICO scores tending to have higher probabilities of claims; \n \u2022 LTV ratios, with higher average LTV ratios tending to increase claims incurred; \n \u2022 DTI ratios, with higher DTIs generally tending to increase claims incurred; \n \u2022 the size of loans insured, with higher average loan amounts tending to increase claims incurred; \n \u2022 the percentage of coverage on insured loans, with higher percentages of insurance coverage tending to result in higher incurred claim amounts than lower percentages of insurance coverage; \n \u2022 other borrower and loan level risk characteristics, such as cash-out refinancings, second homes or investment properties \n \u2022 the rate at which we rescind policies, which we expect to be lower for us than recent rescission rates experienced by the private MI industry due to the terms of our Master Policy and generally tighter underwriting standards; and \n \u2022 the distribution of claims over the life of a book year.  Reserves for claims and allocated claims expenses are established for mortgage loan defaults, which we refer to as case reserves, when we are notified that a borrower has missed two or more mortgage payments (i.e., an NOD). We also make estimates of IBNR defaults, which are defaults that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, based on historical reporting trends, and establish IBNR reserves for those estimates. We also establish reserves for unallocated claims expenses not associated with a specific claim. The claims expenses consist of the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees as well as other general expenses of administering the claims settlement process.\nReserves are established by estimating the number of loans in default that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as claim frequency, and the amount of the claim payment expected to be paid on each such loan in default, which is referred to as\nclaim severity. Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical observed experience regarding certain loan factors, such as age of the default, cure rates, size of the loan and estimated change in property valuation. Reserves are released the month in which a loan in default is brought current by the borrower, which is referred to as a cure. Adjustments to reserve estimates are reflected in the period in which the adjustment is made. Reserves are also ceded to reinsurers under the 2016 QSR Transaction and will be ceded under the 2018 QSR Transaction beginning in 2018. We will not cede reserves to the reinsurer under the 2017 ILN Transaction unless losses exceed our retained coverage layer. Reserves are not established for future claims on insured loans which are not currently in default.\nBased on our experience and industry data, we believe that claims incidence for mortgage insurance is generally highest in the third through sixth years after loan origination. As of December 31, 2017, over 95% of our primary IIF was related to business written since January 1, 2015. Although the claims experience on new primary insurance written by us to date has been favorable, we expect incurred claims to increase as a greater amount of our existing insured portfolio reaches its anticipated period of highest claim frequency. We estimate that the loss ratio over the life of our existing primary insured portfolio will be between 20% and 25% of earned premiums, and we price to that expectation. Additionally, our pool insurance agreement with Fannie Mae contains a claim deductible through which Fannie Mae absorbs specified losses before we are obligated to pay any claims. We have not established any pool reserves for claims or IBNR to date.\nThe actual claims we incur as our portfolio matures are difficult to predict and depend on the specific characteristics of our current in-force book (including the credit score and DTI of the borrower, the LTV ratio of the mortgage and geographic concentrations, among others), as well as the profile of new business we write in the future. In addition, claims experience will be affected by future macroeconomic factors such as housing prices, interest rates and employment and other events, such as natural catastrophes. To date, our claims experience is developing at a slower pace than historical trends indicate, as a result of high quality underwriting, a strong macroeconomic environment and a favorable housing market. For additional discussion of our reserves, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 7, Reserves for Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses.\"\nWe insure mortgages for homes in areas that have been impacted by recent natural disasters, including hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires. We do not provide coverage for property or casualty claims related to physical damage of a home underpinning an insured mortgage. We have experienced an increase in NODs on insured loans in the impacted areas. Our ultimate claims exposure will depend on the number of NODs received, proximate cause of each default and cure rate of the NOD population. In the event of natural disasters, cure rates are influenced by the adequacy of homeowners and other hazard insurance carried on a related property, GSE-sponsored forbearance and other assistance programs, and a borrower's access to aid from government entities and private organizations, in addition to other factors which generally impact cure rates in unaffected areas.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending reserve balances for primary insurance claims and claims expenses.\n\n(1) Related to ceded losses recoverable on the 2016 QSR Transaction, included in \"Other Assets\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6, Reinsurance,\" for additional information.\n(2) Related to insured loans with their most recent defaults occurring in the current year. For example, if a loan had defaulted in a prior year and subsequently cured and later re-defaulted in the current year, that default would be included in the current year.\n(3) Related to insured loans with defaults occurring in prior years, which have been continuously in default since that time.\nThe \"claims incurred\" section of the table above shows claims and claim expenses incurred on NODs for current and prior years, including IBNR reserves. The amount of claims incurred for current year NODs represents the estimated amount to be ultimately paid on such loans in default. The decreases during the periods presented in reserves held for prior year defaults represent favorable development and are generally the result of NOD cures and ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends. We may increase or decrease our original estimates as we learn additional information about individual defaults and claims, and continue to observe and analyze loss development trends in our portfolio. Gross reserves of $1.0 million related to prior year defaults remained as of December 31, 2017.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending count of loans in default.\n\nThe increase in the ending default inventory at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016, was primarily due to new defaults on insured loans in areas impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires, as well as the aging of earlier book years and an increase in the overall number of policies in our portfolio. The increase in the ending default inventory at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 is tied to the growth in the number of policies in force and the expected loss development of our portfolio.\nThe following table provides details of our claims paid, before giving effect to claims ceded under the 2016 QSR Transaction, for the periods indicated.\n\n(1) Severity represents the total amount of claims paid divided by the related RIF on the loan at the time the claim is perfected.\nThe increase in the number of claims paid for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, is due to an increase in our default inventory. We expect the severity of claims we receive to be between 85% and 95% of the coverage amount for the near-term.\n\n(1) Defined as the gross reserve per insured loan in default.\nThe average reserve per default at December 31, 2017 decreased from December 31, 2016 primarily due to new defaults on insured loans in areas impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires. As of December 31, 2017, 533 of the 928 loans in default relate to homes in areas declared by FEMA to be disaster zones following the aforementioned natural disasters. We anticipate that this population of loans in default will cure at a higher rate than the estimated rate we apply to non-disaster related loans in default, due to our Master Policy coverage terms, historical industry experience, and current economic indicators and relief programs. As such, we have established lower reserves for these NODs than we otherwise do for similarly situated NODs in non-disaster zones. Over time, we anticipate that our average reserve per default will revert to our historical averages as the NODs in these zones cure.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our business has been subject to modest seasonality in both NIW production and default experience. Consistent with the seasonality of home sales, purchase origination volumes typically increase in late spring and peak during the summer months, leading to a rise in NIW volume during the second and third quarters of a given year. Refinancing volume, however, does not follow a set seasonal trend and instead is primarily influenced by mortgage rates. An increase in refinancing volume may limit the seasonal effect of home purchase patterns on mortgage insurance NIW. In addition, while macroeconomic factors in any given period may influence default experience to a greater extent than does seasonality, our industry has typically experienced a fourth quarter seasonal increase in the number of defaults and a first quarter seasonal decline in the number of defaults and increase in the number of cures.\nGSE Oversight\nAs an Approved Insurer, NMIC is subject to ongoing compliance with the PMIERs. (Italicized terms have the same meaning that such terms have in the PMIERs, as described below.) The PMIERs establish operational, business, remedial and financial\nrequirements applicable to Approved Insurers. The PMIERs financial requirements prescribe a risk-based methodology whereby the amount of assets required to be held against each insured loan is determined based on certain risk characteristics, such as FICO, vintage (year of origination), performing vs. non-performing (i.e., current vs. delinquent), LTV and other risk features. An asset charge is calculated for each insured loan based on its risk profile. In general, higher quality loans carry lower charges.\nUnder the PMIERs financial requirements, Approved Insurers must maintain available assets that equal or exceed minimum required assets, which is an amount equal to the greater of (i) $400 million or (ii) a total risk-based required asset amount. The risk-based required asset amount is a function of the risk profile of an Approved Insurer's net RIF, calculated by applying on a loan-by-loan basis certain risk-based factors derived from tables set out in the PMIERs to the net RIF, and other transactional adjustments approved by the GSEs, such as with respect to our 2017 ILN Transaction and 2016 QSR Transaction. The risk-based required asset amount for primary insurance is subject to a floor of 5.6% of total, performing, primary RIF, and the risk-based required asset amount for pool insurance considers both the factors in the tables and the net remaining stop loss for each pool insurance policy. The PMIERs financial requirements also increase the amount of available assets that must be held by an Approved Insurer for LPMI policies originated on or after January 1, 2016.\nBy April 15th of each year, NMIC must certify it met all PMIERs requirements as of December 31st of the prior year. As of December 31, 2017, NMIC had sufficient available assets to meet the PMIERs financial requirements, and we expect to certify to the GSEs by April 15, 2018 that NMIC fully complied with the PMIERs as of December 31, 2017. NMIC also has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of its failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements. We continuously monitor our compliance with the PMIERs.\nThe following table provides a comparison of the PMIERs financial requirements as reported by NMIC as of the dates indicated.\n\nAvailable assets were $528 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $454 million at December 31, 2016 and $431 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in available assets of $74 million at December 31, 2017 and $23 million at December 31, 2016 was driven by positive cash flow from operations and the amortization of unearned premium reserves during each period. The increase in the risk-based required asset amount at each measurement date is due to the growth of our gross RIF, partially offset by the cession of risk relating to our third-party reinsurance agreements.\nOn December 18, 2017, the GSEs provided us with a confidential summary of the proposed changes to the PMIERs financial, business and other requirements that they are developing with the FHFA. We have engaged in conversations with the FHFA and the GSEs about the proposed changes and expect to continue to provide feedback to them in the coming months. Once changes to the PMIERs requirements are finalized, we expect the industry will be afforded a six month implementation period and currently anticipate that updated PMIERs requirements, if any, will take effect no sooner than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nCybersecurity\nAs a participant in the mortgage lending and MI industries, we rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide and expand our products and services. We have established and implemented security measures, controls and procedures to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed and/or stored in such systems. We periodically employ third parties to evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, controls and procedures. In addition, we have established a business continuity plan that is designed to allow our business to continue to operate in the midst of certain disruptive events, including any disruptions to our information technology systems. We also have an incident response plan that is designed to address information security incidents, including breaches of our information technology systems. Despite these safeguards, disruptions to and breaches of our information technology systems are possible and may negatively impact our business.\nWe maintain cyber errors and omissions coverage to limit our exposure if an incident occurs. This insurance provides coverage for (i) claims related to, among other things, unauthorized network or computer access, unintentional disclosure or misuse of personally identifiable information in our possession, unintentional failure to disclose a breach and (ii) certain costs related to privacy notification, crisis management, cyber extortion, data recovery and business interruption.\nCapital Position of Our Insurance Subsidiaries and Financial Strength Ratings\nIn addition to GSE-imposed asset requirements, NMIC is also subject to state regulatory minimum capital requirements based on its RIF. While formulations of this minimum capital may vary by jurisdiction, the most common measure allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 25:1.\nAs of December 31, 2017, NMIC's performing primary RIF, net of reinsurance, was approximately $7.3 billion. NMIC ceded 100% of its pool RIF pursuant to the 2016 QSR Transaction. Based on NMIC's total statutory capital of $524 million (including contingency reserves) as of December 31, 2017, NMIC's RTC ratio was 14.0:1. Re One had total statutory capital of $34 million as of December 31, 2017, with a RTC ratio of 0.8:1. We continuously monitor our compliance with state capital requirements.\nIn March 2017, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) upgraded its financial strength rating from \"Ba2\" to \"Ba1\" for NMIC. At that time, Moody's also upgraded its rating of NMIH's $150 million Term Loan from \"B2\" to \"B1.\" In August 2017, Moody's re-affirmed its \"Ba1\" financial strength rating for NMIC and its B1 rating of NMIH's $150 million Term Loan and upgraded the outlook for both ratings from \"stable\" to \"positive.\" In July 2017, S&P re-affirmed its \"BBB-\" financial strength and long-term counter-party credit ratings on NMIC and its \"BB-\" long-term counter-party credit rating on NMIH and upgraded the outlook for both ratings to \"positive.\"\nCompetition\nThe MI industry is highly competitive and currently consists of six private mortgage insurers, including NMIC, as well as public MIs like the FHA and the VA. Private MI companies compete based on service, customer relationships, underwriting and other factors, including price. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business - Overview of Residential Mortgage Finance and the Role of the Private MI Industry in the Current Operating Environment - Competition,\" above. We expect the MI market to remain competitive, with pressure for industry participants to grow or maintain their market share.\nThe private MI industry overall competes more broadly with public MIs who significantly increased their presence in the MI market following the financial crisis. Although there has been broad policy consensus toward the need for private capital to play a larger role and government credit risk to be reduced in the U.S. housing finance system, it remains difficult to predict whether the combined market share of public MIs will recede to historical levels. A range of factors influence a lender's decision to choose private over public MI, including among others, premium rates and other charges, loan eligibility requirements, cancelability, loan size limits and the relative ease of use of private MI products compared to public MI alternatives.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\n(1) Loss ratio is calculated by dividing the provision for insurance claims and claims expenses by net premiums earned.\n(2) Expense ratio is calculated by dividing other underwriting and operating expenses by net premiums earned.\n(3) The 2016 prior period consolidated statements of operations has been revised. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2, Summary of Accounting Principles - Immaterial Correction of Prior Period Amounts,\" for further details.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net premiums earned totaled $165.7 million compared to $110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of net premiums earned of $55.2 million in 2017 was primarily due to the growth of our IIF and increased monthly policy production, partially offset by the decreases in single premium NIW and earnings from cancellations, and the impact of cessions under the 2017 ILN transaction and 2016 QSR Transaction. The $65.0 million increase in net premiums earned in 2016 was primarily due to the growth of our IIF, increased single premium NIW production and higher earnings from cancellations, partially offset by the effect of the 2016 QSR Transaction.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net investment income was $16.3 million compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in both periods was due to an increase in the size of and improved yields on our total investment portfolio.\nExpenses\nWe recognize insurance claims and claims expenses in connection with the loss experience of our insured portfolio and incur other underwriting and operating expenses, including employee compensation and benefits, policy acquisition costs, and technology, professional services and facilities expenses, in connection with the development and operation of our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, insurance claims and claims expenses were $5.3 million compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Insurance claims and claims expenses increased $2.9 million in 2017, as a result of new defaults on insured loans in areas impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the California wildfires, as well as an increase in the overall number of policies in our portfolio and aging of earlier book years, offset by the partial release of reserves related to prior year defaults. Insurance claims and claims expenses increased $1.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in the overall number of policies in our portfolio and aging of earlier book years.\nUnderwriting and operating expenses were $107.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $93.2 million and $80.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Employee compensation accounts for the majority of our operating expenses. We increased the size of our workforce from 243 employees at December 31, 2015 to 276 employees at December 31, 2016 and to 299 employees at December 31, 2017 to support the growth of our business, particularly our sales and operating functions. Underwriting and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 also reflect $4.9 million of operating expenses related to the 2017 ILN Transaction and amendment of our Credit Agreement.\nInterest expense was $13.5 million, $14.8 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense declined in 2017 compared to 2016 in connection with the amendment of our Credit Agreement completed in February 2017, which among other items, reduced the interest spread payable on the Term Loan. The interest expense reduction was partially offset by a rise in the underlying LIBOR rate during 2017. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5, Term Loan.\" Interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting a full year of interest expense for the Term Loan, which we established in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nIncome tax expense was $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to income tax benefit of $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and no income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2015. The fluctuation of our income taxes is the result of significant events during each of periods presented. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $13.6 million primarily due to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a one-time non-cash benefit of $58.8 million related to the release of the valuation allowance recorded against our federal and certain state net deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not record an income tax expense due to the recognition of a valuation allowance against our federal and state net deferred tax assets. For further information regarding income taxes and their impact on our results of operations and financial position, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11, Income Taxes.\"\n\n(1) The 2016 prior period balance sheet has been revised. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2, Summary of Accounting Principles - Immaterial Correction of Prior Period Amounts,\" for further details.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $735.1 million in cash and investments, including $51.0 million held at NMIH. The increase in cash and investments from year-end 2016 primarily relates to cash generated from operations.\nNet deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) were $37.9 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $30.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by growth in the number of policies written during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the deferment of certain costs associated with the origination of those policies, partially offset by the amortization of previously deferred acquisition costs and the capitalization of ceding commissions associated with the 2016 QSR Transaction during the period.\nPremiums receivable increased to $25.2 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $13.7 million as of December 31, 2016 due to growth in the number of monthly policies in force.\nDeferred tax asset, net decreased to $19.9 million as of December 31, 2017, from $51.4 million at December 31, 2016 due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances at the reduced statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards during the period. For further information regarding income taxes and their impact on our results of operations and financial position, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11, Income Taxes.\"\nUnearned premiums increased $10.3 million to $163.2 million as of December 31, 2017, primarily due to single premium policy origination during the period, offset by the amortization through earnings of existing unearned premiums in accordance with the expiration of risk on the related policies and the cancellation of other single premium policies.\nReserve for insurance claims and claims expenses increased $5.8 million to $8.8 million at December 31, 2017, due to an increase in our default inventory at December 31, 2017. See \"- Insurance Claims and Claims Expenses,\" above for further details.\nWarrant liability increased to $7.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $3.4 million at December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in our stock price during the year.\nReinsurance funds withheld was $34.1 million as of December 31, 2017, representing the net of our ceded reinsurance premiums written, less our profit and ceding commission receivables related to the 2016 QSR Transaction. The increase in reinsurance\nfunds withheld of $3.5 million from December 31, 2016, was a result of increased ceded premiums written. See, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6, Reinsurance.\"\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $67.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily caused by increased operating expenses in connection with employee compensation and benefits costs and higher claims paid due to an increase in our default inventory offset by growth in direct premiums written. The increase in cash generated from operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the higher premiums written offset by increased operating expenses associated with the hiring of management and staff personnel and costs for contract and professional services.\nCash used in investing activities for the periods presented was driven by the purchase of fixed and short-term maturities during those periods.\nCash used in financing activities was $3.2 million and $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, and primarily relates to taxes paid on the net share settlement of equity awards for certain employees. Cash provided by financing activities was $143.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and primarily relates to proceeds from the Term Loan which we established in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nHolding Company Liquidity and Capital Resources\nNMIH serves as the holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. NMIH's principal liquidity demands include funds for: (i) payment of certain corporate expenses; (ii) payment of certain reimbursable expenses of its insurance subsidiaries; (iii) payment of principal and interest related to the Term Loan; (iv) tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service; (v) capital support for its subsidiaries; and (vi) payment of dividends, if any, on its common stock. NMIH is not subject to any limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations, such as NMIH, that are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware corporation law provides that dividends are only payable out of a corporation's surplus or recent net profits (subject to certain limitations).\nAs of December 31, 2017, NMIH had $51.0 million of cash and investments. NMIH's principal source of net cash is investment income and in the future could include dividends from NMIC, if available and permitted under law and by the GSEs.\nNMIH has entered into tax and expense-sharing agreements with its subsidiaries which have been approved by the Wisconsin OCI, but such approval may be changed or revoked at any time. With the Wisconsin OCI's approval, NMIH began allocating the interest expense on its Term Loan to NMIC in the first quarter of 2017, consistent with the benefits NMIC received when NMIH down-streamed the loan proceeds to NMIC.\nNMIC's ability to pay dividends to NMIH is subject to insurance department notice or approval. Under Wisconsin law, NMIC may pay dividends up to specified levels (i.e., \"ordinary\" dividends) with 30 days' prior notice to the Wisconsin OCI. Dividends in larger amounts, or \"extraordinary\" dividends, are subject to the Wisconsin OCI's prior approval. Under Wisconsin insurance laws, an extraordinary dividend is defined as any payment or distribution that together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer's statutory policyholders' surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) adjusted statutory net income for the 12-month period ending the preceding December 31. NMIC has never paid any dividends to NMIH. NMIC reported a statutory net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and currently cannot pay any dividends to NMIH through December 31, 2018 without the prior approval of the Wisconsin OCI. Certain other states in which NMIC is licensed also have statutes or regulations that restrict its ability to pay dividends.\nNMIC's capital needs depend on many factors including its ability to successfully write new business, establish premium rates at levels sufficient to cover claims and operating costs and meet minimum required asset thresholds under the PMIERs and state capital requirements. NMIC's capital needs also depend on its decision to access the reinsurance markets. NMIH may require liquidity to fund the capital needs of its insurance subsidiaries.\nIn November 2015, NMIH entered into the Credit Agreement for the Term Loan. On February 10, 2017, NMIH amended the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 1) to reduce the interest rate and extend the maturity date of the Term Loan from November 10, 2018 to November 10, 2019. The amended Term Loan bears interest at the Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement and subject to a 1.00% floor, plus an annual margin rate of 6.75%, payable monthly or quarterly based on our interest rate election. On October 25, 2017, NMIH further amended the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 2) to remove a covenant that required NMIH to maintain liquidity (as defined therein) in an aggregate amount no less than all remaining interest payments due under the Term Loan. As modified by Amendment No. 2, the Credit Agreement retains the requirement that NMIH maintain liquidity in an aggregate amount no less than the sum of all remaining principal amortization payments due under the Term Loan, excluding principal scheduled to be paid on its maturity date, determined to be $2.6 million as of December 31, 2017. The Credit Agreement contains other restrictive covenants and required financial ratios and tests (which were not modified by Amendments No.1 or No.2) that we are required to meet or maintain. The current covenants include, but are not limited to the following: a maximum debt-to-total capitalization ratio (as defined therein) of 35%, maximum RTC ratio of 22.0:1.0, minimum liquidity (as modified by Amendment No. 2 and defined therein), compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements (subject to any GSE-approved waivers), and minimum shareholders' equity requirements.\nConsolidated Investment Portfolio\nOur primary objectives with respect to our investment portfolio are to preserve capital and generate investment income, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to cover our operating needs. We aim to achieve diversification by type, quality, maturity, and industry. We have adopted an investment policy that defines, among other things, eligible and ineligible investments, concentration limits for asset types, industry sectors, single issuers, and certain credit ratings, and benchmarks for asset duration.\nSubstantially all of our investment portfolio is held in fixed maturity instruments. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of our investment portfolio was $715.9 million. We also had an additional $19.2 million of cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2017. Pre-tax book yield on the portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 2.3%. The book yield is calculated as period-to-date net investment income divided by average amortized cost of the investment portfolio. Yield on the investment portfolio is likely to change over time based on movements in interest rates, the duration or mix of our investment portfolio and other factors.\nThe following tables present a breakdown of our investment portfolio and cash and cash equivalents by investment type and credit rating: \nThe ratings of our investment portfolio were:\n\n(1) Include +/- ratings.\nThe ratings above are provided by one or more of: Moody's, S&P and Fitch Ratings. If three ratings are available, we assign\nthe middle rating for classification purposes, otherwise we assign the lowest rating.\nOther-than-Temporary Impairment (OTTI)\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we held no other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) securities, and as of December 31, 2015, we held one OTTI security. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized OTTI losses in earnings of $144 thousand on a single security with an unfavorable recovery forecast. The impaired security was liquidated during the year. There were no credit losses recognized in earnings for which a portion of an OTTI loss was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized an OTTI loss in earnings of $89 thousand on a single security where we expected a planned sale would result in a loss. The impaired security was liquidated in 2016.\nTaxes\nWe are a U.S. taxpayer and are subject to a statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 35% for for all prior years through December 31, 2017. We will be subject to a statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% for the years ending December 31, 2018 and all future periods. Our holding company files a consolidated U.S. federal and various state income tax returns on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries.\nProvisional amounts\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. We have not completed our full assessment of the tax effects of the enactment of the Act on our December 31, 2017 balances; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects on our deferred tax balances. We recognized a $13.6 million income tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2017 for the items we could reasonably estimate primarily related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We are still analyzing the Act and refining our calculation on deferred our tax asset related to share-based compensation, which could affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to further increases or decreases to our deferred tax amounts. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Act expanded the number of individuals whose compensation is subject to a $1 million cap on tax deductibility and includes performance-based compensation in the calculation. As a result, the Company recorded a provisional amount to reduce the future tax benefit related to share-based compensation. We will continue to make and refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. In addition, our estimates may also be affected as we gain a more thorough understanding of the tax law.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) on December 23, 2017. SAB 118 provides a one-year measurement period from a registrant's reporting period that includes the Act's enactment date to allow the registrant sufficient time to obtain, prepare and analyze information to complete the accounting required under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740.\nThe ultimate impact of the Act on our reported results in fiscal 2017 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided herein, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and other actions we may take as a result of the Act differently from that presently contemplated.\nOur effective income tax rate on our pre-tax income was 58.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective income tax rate on our pre-tax loss was (459.0)% and 0.0% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The difference between our statutory tax rate and our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to tax expense of $13.6 million associated with the enactment of the Act, partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.3 million from excess share-based compensation for vested restricted stock units (RSUs) and exercised stock options. The difference between our statutory tax rate and our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the release of the valuation allowance in 2016. Starting in 2018, we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate will approximate the statutory corporate tax rates.\nSince inception and prior to December 31, 2016, we recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, and, as such, we generally did not record a benefit associated with the losses incurred in prior periods or other income tax benefits. At December 31, 2016, after weighing applicable evidence, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that our deferred tax asset would be realized. As a result, as of December 31, 2016, we released the valuation allowance on federal and certain state deferred tax assets. We continued to record a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets, primarily related to state net operating losses generated by NMIH that we do not expect to be utilized. NMIH operates at a loss and continues to only generate revenue from its investment portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the positive evidence that weighed in favor of releasing the valuation allowance and ultimately outweighed the negative evidence against releasing the allowance included:\n \u2022 our net operating loss carryforwards were expected to be fully utilized by 2018; \n \u2022 our other deferred tax assets were based on known recognition schedules and our expectation was that the majority would either reverse in the next three years or were related to deferred tax liabilities; \n \u2022 our significant unearned premium balance which represents future revenue to be earned over the policies' lives; \n \u2022 the substantial growth in our IIF driving the increase in net premiums; \n \u2022 our positive earnings trends from quarterly and annual increases in revenue; \n \u2022 our taxable income in 2016 and our expected taxable income in future years; and \n \u2022 our expectation that we will be in a cumulative profit in a three-year period in 2017.  The primary negative evidence that was considered was our cumulative losses in recent years. Although ASC 740 does not define the term or the length of time to consider when calculating the cumulative loss, practice and interpretations suggest that the guideline, not a \"bright line\", is to aggregate the pretax results as adjusted for permanent items for three years (i.e., the current and the two preceding years).\nAt December 31, 2016, we concluded that positive evidence of sufficient quantity and quality outweighed negative evidence and supported our conclusion that it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our federal and certain state deferred tax assets. The reversal of our beginning-of-the-year valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets (resulting from a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets in future years) is consistent with the requirements of ASC 740-10-45-20. At December 31, 2016, we released the valuation allowance on federal and certain state deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance continued to be recorded against net state deferred tax assets, primarily related to state net operating losses by NMIH that we do not expect to be utilized. NMIH operates at a loss and currently only generates revenue from its investment portfolio.\nWe have examined the results through December 31, 2017, and performed a review of future expectations, which continue to support the conclusion that it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our federal and certain state deferred tax assets. We also concluded to continue to apply a valuation allowance to the net state deferred tax assets, primarily related to state net operating losses by NMIH that we do not expect to be utilized.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $93.3 million which expires from 2030 to 2037, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $89.1 million, which expire in varying amounts during the years 2031 to 2037. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes annual limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards if it experiences an \"ownership change.\" As a result of the acquisition of our insurance subsidiaries in 2012, $7.3 million of NOLs were subject to annual limitations of $0.8 million through 2016, and $0.3 million, thereafter, through 2029.\nThere is a tax sharing agreement between NMIH and its subsidiaries, dated August 23, 2012 and amended on September 1, 2016. Under this agreement, each of the parties mutually agreed to file a consolidated federal income tax return for 2012 and subsequent tax years, with NMIH as the direct tax filer. The tax liability of each subsidiary that is party to the agreement is limited to the amount of the liability it would incur if it filed separate returns.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017. In connection with the 2017 ILN Transaction, we have certain future contractual commitments to Oaktown Re, a special purpose VIE that is not consolidated in our financial results. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2, Summary of Accounting Principles - Variable interest entity\" and \"Note 6, Reinsurance.\"\nContractual obligations at December 31, 2017 are summarized in the table that follows.\n\n(1) Long-term debt relates to our $150 million Credit Agreement and includes future interest payments using the minimum interest rate in effect at December 31, 2017 of 7.75%.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Because the use of estimates is inherent in GAAP, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. A summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below.\nInsurance Premium Revenue Recognition\nPremiums for primary mortgage insurance policies may be paid in a single payment at origination (single premium), on a monthly installment basis (monthly premium) or on an annual installment basis (annual premium), with such election and payment type fixed at policy inception. Premiums written at origination for single premium policies are initially deferred as unearned premium reserve and amortized into earnings over the estimated policy life in accordance with the anticipated expiration of risk. Monthly premiums are recognized as revenue in the month billed as coverage is effective. Annual premiums are initially deferred and earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. Premiums written on pool transactions are earned over the period that coverage is provided. Upon cancellation of a policy, all remaining non-refundable deferred and unearned premium is immediately earned, and any refundable premium is returned to the policyholder. Premiums returned to the policyholder are recorded as a reduction of written and earned premiums in the paid period.\nReserve for Claims and Claims Expenses\nConsistent with industry practice, we establish reserves for claims based on our best estimate of ultimate claim costs for defaulted loans using the general principles contained in ASC 944, Financial Services - Insurance (ASC 944). We establish reserves for loans that have been in default for at least 60 days. Reserves for claims and allocated claims expenses, referred to as case reserves, are established when we are notified of defaults by loan servicers. Additional claims reserves, referred to as IBNR reserves, are established for loans that we estimate (based on actuarial review) have been in default for at least 60 days, but have not yet been reported to us as such by servicers. We also establish reserves for unallocated claims expenses not associated with specific claims. Claims expenses represent the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees, as well as other general expenses of administering the claims settlement process.\nThe establishment of claims and claims expense reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. Reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in default that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as claim frequency, and the amount of the claim payment expected to be paid on each such loan in default, which is\nreferred to as claim severity. Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical observed experience regarding certain loan factors, such as age of the default, size of the loan and LTV ratios, and are strongly influenced by prevailing economic conditions, such as mortgage rates, trends in unemployment and house price appreciation. We conduct an annual actuarial review to evaluate, and, if necessary, update these assumptions.\nInvestments\nWe have designated our investment portfolio as available-for-sale and report it at fair value. The related unrealized gains and losses, after considering the related tax expense or benefit, are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity. Net realized investment gains and losses are reported in income based on specific identification of securities sold, and are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nWe measure fair value and classify invested assets in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three \"levels\" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments.\"\nEach fiscal quarter, we evaluate our investments to determine whether declines in fair value below amortized cost were considered other-than-temporary in accordance with applicable guidance. Under current guidance, a debt security impairment is deemed other-than-temporary if (i) we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery or (ii) we do not expect to collect cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. In evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 our intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery; \n \u2022 severity and duration of the decline in fair value; \n \u2022 the financial condition of the issuer; \n \u2022 the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; \n \u2022 recent credit downgrades of the applicable security or the issuer below investment grade; and \n \u2022 adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or a geographic area. \nPremium Deficiency Reserve\nWe perform a premium deficiency calculation each fiscal quarter using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date. Per ASC 944, a premium deficiency reserve shall be recognized if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses, expected dividends to policyholders, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds future premiums, existing reserves and anticipated investment income. The calculation of premium deficiency reserves requires the use of significant judgment and estimates to determine the present value of future premiums and present value of expected claims and expenses on our business. The present value of future premiums relies on, among other things, assumptions about persistency and repayment patterns on underlying loans. The present value of expected claims and expenses depends on assumptions relating to severity of claims, claim rates on current defaults and expected defaults in future periods. These assumptions may also include an estimate of expected rescission activity. Assumptions used in calculating premium deficiency reserves can be affected by volatility in the current housing and mortgage lending industries. To the extent premium patterns and actual claim experience differ from the assumptions used in calculating a premium deficiency reserve, the differences between the actual results and our estimate will affect future period earnings. In considering the potential sensitivity of the factors underlying our best estimate of premium deficiency reserves, it is possible that even a relatively small change in estimated claim rate or a relatively small percentage change in estimated claim amount could have a significant impact on establishing a premium deficiency reserve, should one be needed, and, correspondingly, on our operating results.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nCosts directly associated with the successful acquisition of mortgage insurance policies, consisting of certain selling expenses and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses, are initially deferred and reported as DAC. DAC is reviewed periodically to determine that it does not exceed recoverable amounts and is adjusted as appropriate for policy cancellations to be consistent with our revenue recognition policy. We estimate the rate of amortization to reflect actual experience and any changes to persistency or loss development. For each book year of business, these costs are amortized to expense in proportion to estimated gross profits over the estimated life of the policies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the expected future tax effects of temporary differences at the enacted tax rates applicable for the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements that would result in future increases or decreases in taxes owed on a cash basis as compared to amounts already recognized as tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Changes in tax laws, rates, regulations and policies, or the final determination of tax audits or examinations, could materially affect our tax estimates.\nWe are required to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We assess our need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. In the course of our review, we assess all available evidence, both positive and negative, including future sources of income, tax planning strategies, future contractual cash flows and reversing temporary differences, and are required to exercise judgment and make assumptions in this regard.\nOur provision for income taxes for interim financial periods is based on an estimate of our annual effective tax rate for the full year. When estimating our full year effective tax rate, we adjust our forecasted pre-tax income for gains and losses on our investments, changes in the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, changes in our beginning of year valuation allowance, and other adjustments. The impact of these items is accounted for discretely at the applicable federal tax rate.\nWarrants\nWe account for warrants to purchase our common shares in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC 815-40 Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. Our outstanding warrants may be settled by us using either (i) a physical settlement method or (ii) cashless exercise, where shares that are issued upon exercise of the warrants are reduced to cover the cost of the exercise, in lieu of the holder remitting a cash payment of the exercise price. The warrants expire, and are not exercisable after the 10th anniversary of the date they were issued. The exercise price and the number of warrants are subject to anti-dilution provisions whereby the existing exercise price is adjusted downward, and the number of warrants increased, for events that may not be dilutive. The adjustment may be in excess of any dilution suffered. As a result, the warrants are classified as a liability. We revalue the warrants at the end of each reporting period, and any change in fair value is reported in the statements of operations in the period in which the change occurred. We calculate the fair value of the warrants using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model in combination with a binomial model. We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the pricing protection features within the warrants. Variables in the model include the fair value of the stock, risk-free rate of return, dividend yield, expected life and expected volatility of the Company's stock price.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which addresses accounting for share-based awards and recognition of compensation expense, measured using grant date fair value, over the requisite service or performance period of the award. Share-based compensation includes RSUs and stock option grants under the NMI Holdings, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (2012 Plan) and the NMI Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Amended 2014 Plan), which amended and restated the NMI Holdings, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2014 Plan). We calculate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which takes into account various subjective assumptions. Key assumptions used in the model include the expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate, as well as the expected option term, giving consideration to the contractual terms of any award and the effects of expected exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. RSU grants to employees may contain a service condition, market and service condition or performance and service condition. RSU grants to employees with a service or a performance condition and RSU grants to non-employee directors are valued at our stock price on the date of grant less the present value of anticipated dividends. The fair value of RSU grants to employees with a market condition are determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of grant.", "item_7_tables": "Table 148: <table><tr><td> </td>
