MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS\nIntroduction\nWe are an electric and natural gas utility and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group. We derive revenues primarily from the distribution and sale of electricity and natural gas to retail customers. We also provide wholesale electric service to numerous utilities and cooperatives for resale. We conduct our business primarily through our utility reportable segment. See Note 18, Segment Information, for more information on our reportable business segments.\nEffective January 1, 2017, our customers and electric and natural gas distribution assets located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were transferred to UMERC, a new stand-alone utility owned by WEC Energy Group. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information.\nEffective January 1, 2017, we transferred our 10.37% ownership interest in WPSI, which held an approximate 34% interest in ATC, to another subsidiary of Integrys. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information.\nCorporate Strategy\nOur goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for customers and shareholders by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; customer care; and safety.\nReshaping Our Generation Fleet\nWEC Energy Group has developed and is executing a plan to reshape its generation portfolio. This plan will balance reliability and customer cost with environmental stewardship. Taken as a whole, this plan should reduce costs to customers, preserve fuel diversity, and lower carbon emissions. Generation reshaping includes retiring older fossil fuel generation units, building state-of-the-art natural gas generation, and investing in cost-effective zero-carbon generation with a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. In addition, WEC Energy Group set a new long-term goal of reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 80% below 2005 levels by 2050. WEC Energy Group expects to retire a total of approximately 1,800 MW of coal-fired generation by 2020 across its electric utilities, and add additional natural gas-fired generating units and renewable generation, including utility-scale solar projects. As part of this effort, the jointly owned Edgewater 4 generating unit was retired in September 2018 (our share of capacity from this plant was 100 MW), and our 200 MW Pulliam power plant was retired in October 2018. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for information related to these plant retirements.\nAs part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, WEC Energy Group plans to invest in utility scale solar of up to 350 MW within its Wisconsin segment, which includes us. We have partnered with an unaffiliated utility to acquire ownership interests in two proposed solar projects in Wisconsin. Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and Two Creeks Solar Project will be located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Subject to PSCW approval, we will own 100 MW of the output of each project for a total of 200 MW. Commercial operation for both projects is targeted for the end of 2020. As the cost of renewable energy generation installations continues to decline, solar projects have become cost effective opportunities for us and our customers to participate in renewable energy.\nReliability\nWe have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and plan to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet and distribution networks to further improve reliability.\nWe continue work on our SMRP, which involves modernizing parts of our electric distribution system, including burying or upgrading lines. The project focuses on constructing facilities to improve the reliability of electric service we provide to our customers. We also continue to upgrade our electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Efficiency\nWe continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company. For example, we are making progress on our Advanced Metering Infrastructure program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between us and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities.\nWEC Energy Group continues to focus on integrating and improving business processes and consolidating its IT infrastructure across all of its companies. We expect these efforts to continue to drive operational efficiency and to put us in position to effectively support plans for future growth.\nFinancial Discipline\nA strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to earning our authorized ROE and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings.\nWe follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plants, and equipment, that are no longer performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information about WEC Energy Group's acquisition of Bluewater and Note 2, Acquisitions, for information on our acquisition of a portion of a wind energy generation facility in Wisconsin.\nExceptional Customer Care\nOur approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. We strive to provide the best value for our customers by embracing constructive change, demonstrating personal responsibility for results, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nOne example of how we obtain feedback from our customers is through our \"We Care\" calls, where our employees contact customers after a completed service call. Customer satisfaction is a priority, and making \"We Care\" calls is one of the main methods we use to gauge our performance to improve customer satisfaction.\nSafety\nWe have a long-standing commitment to both workplace and public safety, and under our \"Target Zero\" mission, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. We also set goals around injury-prevention activities that raise awareness and facilitate conversations about employee safety. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Earnings\nThe following table compares our consolidated results:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,498.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,485.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,448.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>602.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>527.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operation and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>448.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>447.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and revenue taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>285.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below shows the year-over-year income statement impacts associated with the Tax Legislation signed into law in December 2017.

Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.\nWe believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our utility segment as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our utility segment operating performance. Our utility segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $267.1 million, $286.7 million, and $253.9 million, respectively. The operating income discussion below includes a table that provides the calculation of electric margins and natural gas margins, along with a reconciliation to utility segment operating income.\nUtility Segment Contribution to Operating Income\nEffective January 1, 2017, we transferred our electric customers located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to UMERC.

Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets, and internally generated cash.\nWe maintain a bank back-up credit facility, which provides liquidity support for our obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. See Note 12, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for more information on our credit facility.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants related to outstanding short-term and long-term debt. We expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. See Note 13, Long-Term Debt, for more information about our long-term debt.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2018, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by $157.2 million. We do not expect this to have any impact on our liquidity since we believe we have an adequate back-up line of credit in place for our ongoing operations. We also believe that we can access the capital markets to finance our construction programs and to refinance current maturities of long-term debt, if necessary.\nCredit Rating Risk\nWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. However, we have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts that, in the event of a credit rating downgrade, could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.\nSubject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.\nIf we are unable to successfully take actions to manage any adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments or technical corrections exacerbate the adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, the legislation could result in credit rating agencies placing our credit ratings on negative outlook or downgrading our credit ratings. Any such actions by credit rating agencies may make it more difficult and costly for us to issue future debt securities and certain other types of financing and could increase borrowing costs under our credit facility.\nCapital Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nWe have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,334.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>510.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,683.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy and transportation purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,186.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase orders (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and OPEB funding obligations (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,638.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>845.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>342.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,113.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves, and other estimates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Principal and interest payments on long-term debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Energy and transportation purchase obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply, and associated transportation related to utility operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>Purchase obligations related to normal business operations, information technology, and other services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5)\n</td> <td>Obligations for pension and OPEB plans cannot reasonably be estimated beyond 2021.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above does not reflect estimated future payments related to the manufactured gas plant remediation liability of $90.3 million at December 31, 2018, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. We expect to incur costs annually to remediate these sites. See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information about environmental liabilities.\nAROs in the amount of $50.8 million are not included in the above table. Settlement of these liabilities cannot be determined with certainty, but we believe the majority of these liabilities will be settled in more than five years. See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information.\nObligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate-making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures and Significant Capital Projects\nWe have several capital projects that will require significant capital expenditures over the next three years and beyond. All projected capital requirements are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from estimates, depending on a number of factors. These factors include environmental requirements, regulatory restraints and requirements, impacts from the Tax Legislation, additional changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. Our estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are as follows:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>505.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>602.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,488.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are continuing work on the SMRP. This project includes modernizing parts of our electric distribution system, including burying or upgrading lines. The project focuses on constructing facilities to improve the reliability of electric service that we provide to our customers. We expect to invest approximately $185 million between 2019 and 2022 on this project. We also continue to upgrade our electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability. These upgrades include the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) program. AMI is an integrated system of smart meters, communication networks and data management systems that enable two-way communication between utilities and customers.\nAdditionally, as part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, we plan to invest in utility scale solar. We have partnered with an unaffiliated utility to acquire ownership interests in two proposed solar projects in Wisconsin. Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and Two Creeks Solar Project will be located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. We will own 100 MW of the output of each project for a total of 200 MW. Our share of the cost of both projects is estimated to be $260 million. Subject to PSCW approval, commercial operation for both projects is targeted for the end of 2020. Solar generation technology has greatly improved, has become more cost-effective, and it complements our summer demand curve.\nCommon Stock Matters\nFor information related to our common stock matters, see Note 10, Common Equity.\nInvestments in Outside Trusts\nWe use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain OPEB obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $871.0 million as of December 31, 2018. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. We contributed $0.7 million, $66.7 million, and $1.4 million to our pension and OPEB plans in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long-term discount rates. For additional information, see Note 17, Employee Benefits.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit that support construction projects, commodity contracts, and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. See Note 1(p), Guarantees, and Note 12, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for more information.\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nMarket Risks and Other Significant Risks\nWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environments in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:\nRegulatory Recovery\nWe account for our regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our rates are determined by various regulatory commissions. Our primary regulator is the PSCW.\nRegulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the regulated entity believes the recovery of those costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by the PSCW. Recovery of the deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by the PSCW. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of the deferred costs, including those referenced below, is not approved by the PSCW, the costs would be charged to income in the current period. In general, our regulatory assets are recovered over a period of between one to six years. The PSCW can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, our regulatory assets were $485.9 million, and our regulatory liabilities were $792.9 million.\nDue to the Tax Legislation signed into law in December 2017, we remeasured our deferred taxes and recorded a tax benefit of $444.7 million. We have been returning this tax benefit to ratepayers through bill credits and reductions to other regulatory assets, which we expect to continue. See Note 14, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nWe expect to request or have requested recovery of the costs related to the following projects discussed in our recent rate proceedings and orders:\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In June 2016, the PSCW approved the deferral of costs related to our ReACT\u2122 project above the originally authorized $275.0 million level through 2017. The total cost of the ReACT\u2122 project, excluding $51 million of AFUDC, was $342 million. In September 2017, the PSCW approved an extension of this deferral through 2019 as part of a settlement agreement. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. We will be required to obtain a separate approval for collection of these deferred costs in a future rate case.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Prior to its acquisition by WEC Energy Group, Integrys initiated an information technology project with the goal of improving the customer experience at its subsidiaries, including us. Specifically, the project is expected to provide functional and technological benefits to the billing, call center, and credit collection functions. As of December 31, 2018, we had not received any significant disallowances of the costs incurred for this project. We will be required to obtain approval for the recovery of additional costs incurred through the completion of this long-term project.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information regarding recent and pending rate proceedings and orders.\nCommodity Costs\nIn the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs.\nEmbedded within our rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. We have recovery mechanisms in place that allow us to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts. See Item 1. Business - D. Regulation for more information on these mechanisms.\nHigher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. Higher commodity costs combined\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nwith slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills.\nWeather\nOur utility rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. Our electric utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season and, to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our natural gas utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. The fixed charge included in our natural gas rates helps to mitigate the impacts of weather. A summary of actual weather information in our service territory during 2018, 2017, and 2016, as measured by degree days, may be found in Results of Operations.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. We manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. When it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt.\nBased on our variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of one percentage point would have increased annual interest expense by $2.8 million and $2.9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.\nMarketable Securities Return\nWe use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by the PSCW.\nThe fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expected Return on Assets in 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension trust funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>639.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPEB trust funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.\nWEC Energy Group consults with its investment advisors on an annual basis to help it forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the funds.\nEconomic Conditions\nOur service territories are within the state of Wisconsin. As such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional Midwest economy. In addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInflation\nWe continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, and regulatory and environmental compliance in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.\nFor additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCompetitive Markets\nElectric Utility Industry\nThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. The FERC continues to support large RTOs, which affects the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, MISO implemented the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us.\nElectric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date, and it is uncertain when, if at all, retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin.\nNatural Gas Utility Industry\nThe PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of natural gas distribution utilities should change to reflect a competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to provide customer classes with competitive markets the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier. The PSCW has also adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates. All of our Wisconsin customer classes have competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from either an alternative retail natural gas supplier or their local natural gas utility.\nWe offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas from an alternative retail natural gas supplier. Since these transportation customers continue to use our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities, we earn distribution revenues from them. As such, there is little impact on our net income from customers purchasing natural gas from an alternative retail natural gas supplier as natural gas costs are passed through to customers in rates on a one-for-one basis. We are currently unable to predict the impact of potential future industry restructuring on our results of operations or financial position.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, for a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change.\nOther Matters\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nIn December 2017, the Tax Legislation was signed into law. The PSCW issued a written order in May 2018 regarding how to refund certain tax savings from the Tax Legislation to our ratepayers. We are also working with the FERC to modify our formula rate tariffs for the impacts of the Tax Legislation, and we expect to receive FERC approval for the modified tariffs in 2019. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBonus Depreciation Provisions\nBonus depreciation is an additional amount of first-year tax deductible depreciation that is awarded above what would normally be available. The bonus depreciation deduction available for public utility property subject to rate-making by a government entity or public utility commission was modified by the Tax Legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017. Based on the provisions of the Tax Legislation, bonus depreciation can no longer be deducted for public utility property acquired and placed in service after December 31, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.\nThe following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\nGoodwill\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test for our utility reporting unit as of July 1, 2018, and no impairment was recorded as a result of this test. At July 1, 2018, our utility reporting unit had $36.4 million of goodwill. The fair value calculated in step one of the test was greater than carrying value. The fair value of our reporting unit was calculated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.\nFor the income approach, we used internal forecasts to project cash flows. Any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the calculated fair value of a reporting unit. Since our reporting unit is regulated, a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed. An unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair value of our reporting unit to decrease.\nKey assumptions used in the income approach included ROE, the long-term growth rate used to determine the terminal value at the end of the discrete forecast period, and the discount rate. The discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach. As interest rates rise, the calculated fair value will decrease. The discount rate is based on the weighted-average cost of capital, taking into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. The terminal year ROE is driven by our current allowed ROE. The terminal growth rate is based primarily on a combination of our service area's historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income.\nFor the market approach, we used an equal weighting of the guideline public company method and the guideline merged and acquired company method. The guideline public company method uses financial metrics from similar publicly traded companies to determine fair value. The guideline merged and acquired company method calculates fair value by analyzing the actual prices paid for recent mergers and acquisitions in the industry. We applied multiples derived from these two methods to the appropriate operating metrics for our reporting unit to determine fair value.\nThe underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment test were made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the result of the test.\nThe fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by over 50%. Based on this result, our reporting unit is not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.\nLong-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long-lived assets may not be recoverable.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExamples of events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price, a significant change in use, adverse legal factors or a change in business climate, operating or cash flow losses, or an expectation that the asset might be sold. These assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management. The long-lived assets assessed for impairment generally include certain assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from our customers as a result of regulatory decisions that will be made in the future.\nWe have evaluated future plans for our older and less efficient fossil fuel generating units and have retired certain generating units. In accordance with ASC 980-360, Regulated Operations - Property, Plant, and Equipment, when it becomes probable that a generating unit will be retired before the end of its useful life, we assess whether the generating unit meets the criteria for abandonment accounting. Generating units that are considered probable of abandonment are expected to cease operations in the near term, significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. As a result, the remaining net book value of these assets can be significant. If a generating unit meets applicable criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, and after the unit is abandoned, we assess the likelihood of recovery of the remaining carrying value of that generating unit at the end of each reporting period. If it becomes probable that regulators will disallow full recovery as well as a return on the remaining net book value of a generating unit that is either abandoned or probable of being abandoned, an impairment loss may be required. An impairment loss would be recorded if the remaining carrying value of the generating unit is greater than the present value of the amount expected to be recovered from ratepayers.\nPulliam Units 7 and 8 and the jointly-owned Edgewater 4 generating unit were retired during 2018. We plan to ask for full cost recovery of and a full return on the remaining book value of these generating units and have concluded that no impairment was required related to these assets as of December 31, 2018. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on our retired generating units, including various approvals we have received from the FERC.\nPension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and OPEB, described in Note 17, Employee Benefits, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.\nPension and OPEB costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and OPEB costs.\nPension and OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. We believe that such changes in costs would be recovered or refunded through the ratemaking process.\nThe following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumption\n(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage-Point Change in Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on Projected Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on 2018\nPension Cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated OPEB obligation and the reported net periodic OPEB cost.

The bonds are generally rated \"Aa\" with a minimum amount outstanding of $50.0 million. From the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments.\nWe establish our expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 7.25% in 2018, 2017, and 2016. The actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was (5.9)%, 16.31%, and 8.79%, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nIn selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. For more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and OPEB, see Note 17, Employee Benefits.\nRegulatory Accounting\nOur utility operations follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the PSCW. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by the PSCW.\nFuture recovery of regulatory assets is not assured and is generally subject to review by the PSCW in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings from our electric and natural gas utility operations, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.\nThe application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer met the criteria for application. Our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred. As of December 31, 2018, we had $485.9 million in regulatory assets and $792.9 million in regulatory liabilities. See Note 5, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information.\nUnbilled Revenues\nWe record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\naccuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2018 of approximately $1.5 billion included accrued utility revenues of $67.1 million as of December 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. We also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in our income statements.\nUncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income tax benefits that meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1(m), Income Taxes, and Note 14, Income Taxes, for a discussion of accounting for income taxes.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS\nIntroduction\nWe are an electric and natural gas utility and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group. We derive revenues primarily from the distribution and sale of electricity and natural gas to retail customers. We also provide wholesale electric service to numerous utilities and cooperatives for resale. We conduct our business primarily through our utility reportable segment. See Note 18, Segment Information, for more information on our reportable business segments.\nEffective January 1, 2017, our customers and electric and natural gas distribution assets located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were transferred to UMERC, a new stand-alone utility owned by WEC Energy Group. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information.\nEffective January 1, 2017, we transferred our 10.37% ownership interest in WPSI, which held an approximate 34% interest in ATC, to another subsidiary of Integrys. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information.\nCorporate Strategy\nOur goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for customers and shareholders by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; customer care; and safety.\nReshaping Our Generation Fleet\nWEC Energy Group has developed and is executing a plan to reshape its generation portfolio. This plan will balance reliability and customer cost with environmental stewardship. Taken as a whole, this plan should reduce costs to customers, preserve fuel diversity, and lower carbon emissions. Generation reshaping includes retiring older fossil fuel generation units, building state-of-the-art natural gas generation, and investing in cost-effective zero-carbon generation with a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. In addition, WEC Energy Group set a new long-term goal of reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 80% below 2005 levels by 2050. WEC Energy Group expects to retire a total of approximately 1,800 MW of coal-fired generation by 2020 across its electric utilities, and add additional natural gas-fired generating units and renewable generation, including utility-scale solar projects. As part of this effort, the jointly owned Edgewater 4 generating unit was retired in September 2018 (our share of capacity from this plant was 100 MW), and our 200 MW Pulliam power plant was retired in October 2018. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for information related to these plant retirements.\nAs part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, WEC Energy Group plans to invest in utility scale solar of up to 350 MW within its Wisconsin segment, which includes us. We have partnered with an unaffiliated utility to acquire ownership interests in two proposed solar projects in Wisconsin. Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and Two Creeks Solar Project will be located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Subject to PSCW approval, we will own 100 MW of the output of each project for a total of 200 MW. Commercial operation for both projects is targeted for the end of 2020. As the cost of renewable energy generation installations continues to decline, solar projects have become cost effective opportunities for us and our customers to participate in renewable energy.\nReliability\nWe have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and plan to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet and distribution networks to further improve reliability.\nWe continue work on our SMRP, which involves modernizing parts of our electric distribution system, including burying or upgrading lines. The project focuses on constructing facilities to improve the reliability of electric service we provide to our customers. We also continue to upgrade our electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Efficiency\nWe continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company. For example, we are making progress on our Advanced Metering Infrastructure program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between us and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities.\nWEC Energy Group continues to focus on integrating and improving business processes and consolidating its IT infrastructure across all of its companies. We expect these efforts to continue to drive operational efficiency and to put us in position to effectively support plans for future growth.\nFinancial Discipline\nA strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to earning our authorized ROE and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings.\nWe follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plants, and equipment, that are no longer performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information about WEC Energy Group's acquisition of Bluewater and Note 2, Acquisitions, for information on our acquisition of a portion of a wind energy generation facility in Wisconsin.\nExceptional Customer Care\nOur approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. We strive to provide the best value for our customers by embracing constructive change, demonstrating personal responsibility for results, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nOne example of how we obtain feedback from our customers is through our \"We Care\" calls, where our employees contact customers after a completed service call. Customer satisfaction is a priority, and making \"We Care\" calls is one of the main methods we use to gauge our performance to improve customer satisfaction.\nSafety\nWe have a long-standing commitment to both workplace and public safety, and under our \"Target Zero\" mission, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. We also set goals around injury-prevention activities that raise awareness and facilitate conversations about employee safety. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Earnings\nThe following table compares our consolidated results:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,498.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,485.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,448.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>602.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>527.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operation and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>448.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>447.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and revenue taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>285.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below shows the year-over-year income statement impacts associated with the Tax Legislation signed into law in December 2017.

Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.\nWe believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our utility segment as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our utility segment operating performance.

The significant factors impacting the lower electric utility margins were:\n \u2022 A $17.9 million decrease in margins related to savings from the Tax Legislation that we are required to return to customers through bill credits or reductions in other regulatory assets. See Note 14, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. \n \u2022 A $15.0 million decrease in wholesale margins driven both by lower sales volumes and reduced capacity rates due in part to the Tax Legislation. \nThese decreases in electric utility margins were partially offset by a $22.6 million increase related to higher retail sales volumes during 2018, primarily driven by favorable weather and higher use per residential and large commercial and industrial customer due in part to a stronger economy. Colder winter weather and a warmer summer in 2018 contributed to the increase. As measured by heating degree days, 2018 was 8.8% colder than 2017. As measured by cooling degree days, 2018 was 50.7% warmer than 2017.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNatural Gas Utility Margins\nNatural gas utility margins decreased $3.3 million during 2018, compared with 2017. The most significant factor impacting the lower natural gas utility margins was $6.7 million of savings from the Tax Legislation that we are required to return to customers through bill credits. See Note 14, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. This decrease in natural gas utility margins was partially offset by a $3.7 million increase related to higher sales volumes, primarily driven by colder winter weather, customer growth, and higher use per retail customer due in part to a stronger economy.\nOperating Income\nOperating income at the utility segment decreased $19.6 million during 2018, compared with 2017. The decrease was driven by the $15.0 million decrease in margins discussed above and $4.6 million of higher operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenues taxes).\nThe significant factors impacting the increase in operating expenses during 2018, compared with 2017, were:\n \u2022 A $21.2 million increase in expense related to our earnings sharing mechanism. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. \n \u2022 An $8.5 million increase in benefit costs. \nThese increases in operating expenses were partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $13.4 million decrease in expenses across all of our plants, in part due to the retirement of Edgewater Unit 4 in September 2018 and the retirement of Pulliam Units 7 and 8 in October 2018. This resulted in lower maintenance and labor costs during 2018. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on the plant retirements. \n \u2022 An $8.1 million decrease in electric and natural gas distribution expenses, primarily driven by lower expenses incurred related to storm damage during 2018. \n2017 Compared with 2016\nElectric Utility Margins\nElectric utility margins decreased $10.4 million during 2017, compared with 2016. The significant factors impacting the lower electric utility margins were:\n \u2022 A $15.6 million decrease related to lower retail sales volumes during 2017, primarily driven by the transfer of customers and their related sales to UMERC, the impact of cooler summer weather, and an additional day of sales during 2016 due to leap year. As measured by cooling degree days, 2017 was 21.3% cooler than 2016. \n \u2022 A $4.3 million year-over-year negative impact from collections of fuel and purchased power costs compared with costs approved in rates. Under the Wisconsin fuel rules, our electric margins are impacted by under- or over-collections of certain fuel and purchased power costs that are less than a 2% price variance from the costs included in rates, and the remaining variance that exceeds the 2% variance is deferred. \nPartially offsetting these decreases in electric utility margins was a $10.4 million increase in wholesale margins during 2017, driven by UMERC purchasing a portion of its energy from us.\nNatural Gas Utility Margins\nNatural gas utility margins increased $1.3 million during 2017, compared with 2016. The most significant factor impacting the higher natural gas utility margins was higher retail sales volumes, primarily driven by colder winter weather in 2017.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Income\nOperating income at the utility segment increased $32.8 million during 2017, compared with 2016. The increase was driven by$41.9 million of lower operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenues taxes), partially offset by the $9.1 million net decrease in margins discussed above.\nThe utility segment experienced lower overall operating expenses related to synergy savings resulting from the acquisition of our parent company, Integrys, by WEC Energy Group. The significant factors impacting the decrease in operating expenses during 2017, compared with 2016, which were due in part to synergy savings, were:\n \u2022 A $20.0 million decrease in expenses related to an information technology project completed in 2016 to improve the billing, call center, and credit collection functions of the Integrys subsidiaries, including us. Lower expenses were due in part to a decrease in asset usage charges from WBS, driven by the transfer of this project from WBS to us in 2017. The portion of these lower expenses related to the transfer was offset through higher depreciation and amortization, discussed below. \n \u2022 A $13.5 million decrease in operation and maintenance expenses related to our plants. \n \u2022 A $9.3 million decrease in benefit costs. \n \u2022 An $8.8 million decrease in electric and natural gas distribution expenses, driven by lower metering costs, the transfer of customers and their related sales to UMERC, and other cost savings. \nThese decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $15.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by the completion of the ReACTTM multi-pollutant control system at Weston Unit 3 during the fourth quarter of 2016 and WBS's transfer of the information technology project to us during 2017.\nOther Segment Contribution to Operating Loss\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Other Income, Net\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AFUDC - Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-service components of net periodic benefit costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from equity method investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared with 2017\nOther income, net increased by $13.9 million during 2018, compared with 2017.

See Note 17, Employee Benefits, for more information on our benefit costs.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nOther income, net decreased by $17.6 million during 2017, compared with 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower AFUDC driven by the ReACTTM emission control technology project at Weston Unit 3 going into service during the fourth quarter of 2016. Also contributing to the decrease were lower earnings from our equity method investments due to the transfer of our ownership interest in WPSI to another subsidiary of Integrys effective January 1, 2017.

This increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits associated with AFUDC - Equity.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows during the years ended December 31:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2018 Over 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in 2017 Over 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(552.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(342.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(340.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(209.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(129.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\n2018 Compared with 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $42.1 million during 2018, compared with 2017, driven by:\n \u2022 A $157.8 million net decrease in cash related to cash received during 2017 for net assets transferred out of our pension plan. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information. \n \u2022 An $18.5 million decrease in cash related to an increase in cash paid for income taxes during 2018, compared with 2017. This decrease in cash was due to a federal income tax refund received in 2017, primarily associated to certain property related tax deductions. \nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 An $11.0 million decrease in cash resulting from higher payments during 2018, compared with 2017, for natural gas we purchased to meet the requirements of our customers during the colder winter weather. \nThese decreases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $66.0 million decrease in contributions and payments to our pension and OPEB plans during 2018, compared with 2017. \n \u2022 A $44.6 million increase in cash from lower payments for operating and maintenance expenses.

See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information about the retirement of our plants. In addition, our payments for electric and natural gas distribution costs decreased during 2018. \n \u2022 A $29.6 million increase in cash related to higher overall collections from customers, primarily due to favorable weather during 2018, compared with 2017. \n2017 Compared with 2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $87.6 million during 2017, compared with 2016, driven by:\n \u2022 A $157.8 million increase in cash related to cash received for net assets transferred out of our pension plan during 2017. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information. \n \u2022 A $52.2 million increase in cash related to higher overall collections from customers, primarily due to higher commodity prices. The average per-unit cost of natural gas sold increased 9.7% during 2017, compared with 2016. \n \u2022 A $47.8 million increase in cash from lower payments for operating and maintenance expenses. During 2017, our payments related to transmission, electric and natural gas distribution costs, and operation and maintenance at our plants decreased. \nThese increases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $65.3 million increase in contributions and payments to our pension and OPEB plans during 2017, compared with 2016. \n \u2022 A $62.7 million decrease in cash resulting from higher payments for natural gas and fuel and purchased power, primarily due to higher commodity prices during 2017, compared with 2016. \n \u2022 A $58.0 million net decrease in cash related to $18.1 million of cash paid for income taxes during 2017, compared with $39.9 million of cash received during 2016. This decrease in cash was primarily the result of increased bonus depreciation deductions related to large capital projects in 2016. \nInvesting Activities\n2018 Compared with 2017\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $209.9 million during 2018, compared with 2017, driven by:\n \u2022 A $108.5 million increase in cash paid for capital expenditures during 2018, compared with 2017, which is discussed in more detail below. \n \u2022 The acquisition of a portion of Forward Wind Energy Center during April 2018 for $77.1 million.

Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets, and internally generated cash.\nWe maintain a bank back-up credit facility, which provides liquidity support for our obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. See Note 12, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for more information on our credit facility.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants related to outstanding short-term and long-term debt. We expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. See Note 13, Long-Term Debt, for more information about our long-term debt.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2018, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by $157.2 million. We do not expect this to have any impact on our liquidity since we believe we have an adequate back-up line of credit in place for our ongoing operations. We also believe that we can access the capital markets to finance our construction programs and to refinance current maturities of long-term debt, if necessary.\nCredit Rating Risk\nWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. However, we have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts that, in the event of a credit rating downgrade, could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.\nSubject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.\nIf we are unable to successfully take actions to manage any adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments or technical corrections exacerbate the adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, the legislation could result in credit rating agencies placing our credit ratings on negative outlook or downgrading our credit ratings. Any such actions by credit rating agencies may make it more difficult and costly for us to issue future debt securities and certain other types of financing and could increase borrowing costs under our credit facility.\nCapital Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nWe have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,334.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>510.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,683.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy and transportation purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,186.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase orders (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and OPEB funding obligations (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,638.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>845.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>342.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,113.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves, and other estimates. \n (2) Principal and interest payments on long-term debt. \n (3) Energy and transportation purchase obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply, and associated transportation related to utility operations. \n (4) Purchase obligations related to normal business operations, information technology, and other services. \n (5) Obligations for pension and OPEB plans cannot reasonably be estimated beyond 2021. \nThe table above does not reflect estimated future payments related to the manufactured gas plant remediation liability of $90.3 million at December 31, 2018, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. We expect to incur costs annually to remediate these sites. See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information about environmental liabilities.\nAROs in the amount of $50.8 million are not included in the above table. Settlement of these liabilities cannot be determined with certainty, but we believe the majority of these liabilities will be settled in more than five years. See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information.\nObligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate-making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures and Significant Capital Projects\nWe have several capital projects that will require significant capital expenditures over the next three years and beyond. All projected capital requirements are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from estimates, depending on a number of factors. These factors include environmental requirements, regulatory restraints and requirements, impacts from the Tax Legislation, additional changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. Our estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are as follows:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>505.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>602.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,488.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are continuing work on the SMRP. This project includes modernizing parts of our electric distribution system, including burying or upgrading lines. The project focuses on constructing facilities to improve the reliability of electric service that we provide to our customers. We expect to invest approximately $185 million between 2019 and 2022 on this project. We also continue to upgrade our electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability. These upgrades include the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) program. AMI is an integrated system of smart meters, communication networks and data management systems that enable two-way communication between utilities and customers.\nAdditionally, as part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, we plan to invest in utility scale solar. We have partnered with an unaffiliated utility to acquire ownership interests in two proposed solar projects in Wisconsin. Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and Two Creeks Solar Project will be located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. We will own 100 MW of the output of each project for a total of 200 MW. Our share of the cost of both projects is estimated to be $260 million. Subject to PSCW approval, commercial operation for both projects is targeted for the end of 2020. Solar generation technology has greatly improved, has become more cost-effective, and it complements our summer demand curve.\nCommon Stock Matters\nFor information related to our common stock matters, see Note 10, Common Equity.\nInvestments in Outside Trusts\nWe use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain OPEB obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $871.0 million as of December 31, 2018. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. We contributed $0.7 million, $66.7 million, and $1.4 million to our pension and OPEB plans in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long-term discount rates. For additional information, see Note 17, Employee Benefits.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit that support construction projects, commodity contracts, and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. See Note 1(p), Guarantees, and Note 12, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for more information.\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nMarket Risks and Other Significant Risks\nWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environments in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:\nRegulatory Recovery\nWe account for our regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our rates are determined by various regulatory commissions. Our primary regulator is the PSCW.\nRegulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the regulated entity believes the recovery of those costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by the PSCW. Recovery of the deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by the PSCW. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of the deferred costs, including those referenced below, is not approved by the PSCW, the costs would be charged to income in the current period. In general, our regulatory assets are recovered over a period of between one to six years. The PSCW can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, our regulatory assets were $485.9 million, and our regulatory liabilities were $792.9 million.\nDue to the Tax Legislation signed into law in December 2017, we remeasured our deferred taxes and recorded a tax benefit of $444.7 million. We have been returning this tax benefit to ratepayers through bill credits and reductions to other regulatory assets, which we expect to continue. See Note 14, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nWe expect to request or have requested recovery of the costs related to the following projects discussed in our recent rate proceedings and orders:\n \u2022 In June 2016, the PSCW approved the deferral of costs related to our ReACT\u2122 project above the originally authorized $275.0 million level through 2017. The total cost of the ReACT\u2122 project, excluding $51 million of AFUDC, was $342 million. In September 2017, the PSCW approved an extension of this deferral through 2019 as part of a settlement agreement. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. We will be required to obtain a separate approval for collection of these deferred costs in a future rate case. \n \u2022 Prior to its acquisition by WEC Energy Group, Integrys initiated an information technology project with the goal of improving the customer experience at its subsidiaries, including us. Specifically, the project is expected to provide functional and technological benefits to the billing, call center, and credit collection functions. As of December 31, 2018, we had not received any significant disallowances of the costs incurred for this project. We will be required to obtain approval for the recovery of additional costs incurred through the completion of this long-term project. \nSee Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information regarding recent and pending rate proceedings and orders.\nCommodity Costs\nIn the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs.\nEmbedded within our rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. We have recovery mechanisms in place that allow us to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts. See Item 1. Business - D. Regulation for more information on these mechanisms.\nHigher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. Higher commodity costs combined\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nwith slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills.\nWeather\nOur utility rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. Our electric utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season and, to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our natural gas utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. The fixed charge included in our natural gas rates helps to mitigate the impacts of weather. A summary of actual weather information in our service territory during 2018, 2017, and 2016, as measured by degree days, may be found in Results of Operations.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. We manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. When it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt.\nBased on our variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of one percentage point would have increased annual interest expense by $2.8 million and $2.9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.\nMarketable Securities Return\nWe use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by the PSCW.\nThe fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expected Return on Assets in 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension trust funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>639.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPEB trust funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.\nWEC Energy Group consults with its investment advisors on an annual basis to help it forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the funds.\nEconomic Conditions\nOur service territories are within the state of Wisconsin. As such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional Midwest economy. In addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInflation\nWe continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, and regulatory and environmental compliance in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.\nFor additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCompetitive Markets\nElectric Utility Industry\nThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. The FERC continues to support large RTOs, which affects the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, MISO implemented the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us.\nElectric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date, and it is uncertain when, if at all, retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin.\nNatural Gas Utility Industry\nThe PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of natural gas distribution utilities should change to reflect a competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to provide customer classes with competitive markets the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier. The PSCW has also adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates. All of our Wisconsin customer classes have competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from either an alternative retail natural gas supplier or their local natural gas utility.\nWe offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas from an alternative retail natural gas supplier. Since these transportation customers continue to use our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities, we earn distribution revenues from them. As such, there is little impact on our net income from customers purchasing natural gas from an alternative retail natural gas supplier as natural gas costs are passed through to customers in rates on a one-for-one basis. We are currently unable to predict the impact of potential future industry restructuring on our results of operations or financial position.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, for a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change.\nOther Matters\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nIn December 2017, the Tax Legislation was signed into law. The PSCW issued a written order in May 2018 regarding how to refund certain tax savings from the Tax Legislation to our ratepayers. We are also working with the FERC to modify our formula rate tariffs for the impacts of the Tax Legislation, and we expect to receive FERC approval for the modified tariffs in 2019. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBonus Depreciation Provisions\nBonus depreciation is an additional amount of first-year tax deductible depreciation that is awarded above what would normally be available. The bonus depreciation deduction available for public utility property subject to rate-making by a government entity or public utility commission was modified by the Tax Legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017. Based on the provisions of the Tax Legislation, bonus depreciation can no longer be deducted for public utility property acquired and placed in service after December 31, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.\nThe following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\nGoodwill\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test for our utility reporting unit as of July 1, 2018, and no impairment was recorded as a result of this test. At July 1, 2018, our utility reporting unit had $36.4 million of goodwill. The fair value calculated in step one of the test was greater than carrying value. The fair value of our reporting unit was calculated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.\nFor the income approach, we used internal forecasts to project cash flows. Any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the calculated fair value of a reporting unit. Since our reporting unit is regulated, a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed. An unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair value of our reporting unit to decrease.\nKey assumptions used in the income approach included ROE, the long-term growth rate used to determine the terminal value at the end of the discrete forecast period, and the discount rate. The discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach. As interest rates rise, the calculated fair value will decrease. The discount rate is based on the weighted-average cost of capital, taking into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. The terminal year ROE is driven by our current allowed ROE. The terminal growth rate is based primarily on a combination of our service area's historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income.\nFor the market approach, we used an equal weighting of the guideline public company method and the guideline merged and acquired company method. The guideline public company method uses financial metrics from similar publicly traded companies to determine fair value. The guideline merged and acquired company method calculates fair value by analyzing the actual prices paid for recent mergers and acquisitions in the industry. We applied multiples derived from these two methods to the appropriate operating metrics for our reporting unit to determine fair value.\nThe underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment test were made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the result of the test.\nThe fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by over 50%. Based on this result, our reporting unit is not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.\nLong-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long-lived assets may not be recoverable.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExamples of events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price, a significant change in use, adverse legal factors or a change in business climate, operating or cash flow losses, or an expectation that the asset might be sold. These assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management. The long-lived assets assessed for impairment generally include certain assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from our customers as a result of regulatory decisions that will be made in the future.\nWe have evaluated future plans for our older and less efficient fossil fuel generating units and have retired certain generating units. In accordance with ASC 980-360, Regulated Operations - Property, Plant, and Equipment, when it becomes probable that a generating unit will be retired before the end of its useful life, we assess whether the generating unit meets the criteria for abandonment accounting. Generating units that are considered probable of abandonment are expected to cease operations in the near term, significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. As a result, the remaining net book value of these assets can be significant. If a generating unit meets applicable criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, and after the unit is abandoned, we assess the likelihood of recovery of the remaining carrying value of that generating unit at the end of each reporting period. If it becomes probable that regulators will disallow full recovery as well as a return on the remaining net book value of a generating unit that is either abandoned or probable of being abandoned, an impairment loss may be required. An impairment loss would be recorded if the remaining carrying value of the generating unit is greater than the present value of the amount expected to be recovered from ratepayers.\nPulliam Units 7 and 8 and the jointly-owned Edgewater 4 generating unit were retired during 2018. We plan to ask for full cost recovery of and a full return on the remaining book value of these generating units and have concluded that no impairment was required related to these assets as of December 31, 2018. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on our retired generating units, including various approvals we have received from the FERC.\nPension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and OPEB, described in Note 17, Employee Benefits, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.\nPension and OPEB costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and OPEB costs.\nPension and OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. We believe that such changes in costs would be recovered or refunded through the ratemaking process.\nThe following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumption\n(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage-Point Change in Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on Projected Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on 2018\nPension Cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated OPEB obligation and the reported net periodic OPEB cost.

The bonds are generally rated \"Aa\" with a minimum amount outstanding of $50.0 million. From the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments.\nWe establish our expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 7.25% in 2018, 2017, and 2016. The actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was (5.9)%, 16.31%, and 8.79%, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nIn selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. For more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and OPEB, see Note 17, Employee Benefits.\nRegulatory Accounting\nOur utility operations follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the PSCW. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by the PSCW.\nFuture recovery of regulatory assets is not assured and is generally subject to review by the PSCW in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings from our electric and natural gas utility operations, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.\nThe application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer met the criteria for application. Our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred. As of December 31, 2018, we had $485.9 million in regulatory assets and $792.9 million in regulatory liabilities. See Note 5, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information.\nUnbilled Revenues\nWe record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Form 10-K\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>Wisconsin Public Service Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\naccuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2018 of approximately $1.5 billion included accrued utility revenues of $67.1 million as of December 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. We also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in our income statements.\nUncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income tax benefits that meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1(m), Income Taxes, and Note 14, Income Taxes, for a discussion of accounting for income taxes.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS\nIntroduction\nWe are an electric and natural gas utility and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group. We derive revenues primarily from the distribution and sale of electricity and natural gas to retail customers. We also provide wholesale electric service to numerous utilities and cooperatives for resale. We conduct our business primarily through our utility reportable segment. See Note 18, Segment Information, for more information on our reportable business segments.\nEffective January 1, 2017, our customers and electric and natural gas distribution assets located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were transferred to UMERC, a new stand-alone utility owned by WEC Energy Group. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information.\nEffective January 1, 2017, we transferred our 10.37% ownership interest in WPSI, which held an approximate 34% interest in ATC, to another subsidiary of Integrys. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information.\nCorporate Strategy\nOur goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for customers and shareholders by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; customer care; and safety.\nReshaping Our Generation Fleet\nWEC Energy Group has developed and is executing a plan to reshape its generation portfolio. This plan will balance reliability and customer cost with environmental stewardship. Taken as a whole, this plan should reduce costs to customers, preserve fuel diversity, and lower carbon emissions. Generation reshaping includes retiring older fossil fuel generation units, building state-of-the-art natural gas generation, and investing in cost-effective zero-carbon generation with a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. In addition, WEC Energy Group set a new long-term goal of reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 80% below 2005 levels by 2050. WEC Energy Group expects to retire a total of approximately 1,800 MW of coal-fired generation by 2020 across its electric utilities, and add additional natural gas-fired generating units and renewable generation, including utility-scale solar projects. As part of this effort, the jointly owned Edgewater 4 generating unit was retired in September 2018 (our share of capacity from this plant was 100 MW), and our 200 MW Pulliam power plant was retired in October 2018. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for information related to these plant retirements.\nAs part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, WEC Energy Group plans to invest in utility scale solar of up to 350 MW within its Wisconsin segment, which includes us. We have partnered with an unaffiliated utility to acquire ownership interests in two proposed solar projects in Wisconsin. Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and Two Creeks Solar Project will be located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Subject to PSCW approval, we will own 100 MW of the output of each project for a total of 200 MW. Commercial operation for both projects is targeted for the end of 2020. As the cost of renewable energy generation installations continues to decline, solar projects have become cost effective opportunities for us and our customers to participate in renewable energy.\nReliability\nWe have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and plan to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet and distribution networks to further improve reliability.\nWe continue work on our SMRP, which involves modernizing parts of our electric distribution system, including burying or upgrading lines. The project focuses on constructing facilities to improve the reliability of electric service we provide to our customers. We also continue to upgrade our electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability.\n\nOperating Efficiency\nWe continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company. For example, we are making progress on our Advanced Metering Infrastructure program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between us and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities.\nWEC Energy Group continues to focus on integrating and improving business processes and consolidating its IT infrastructure across all of its companies. We expect these efforts to continue to drive operational efficiency and to put us in position to effectively support plans for future growth.\nFinancial Discipline\nA strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to earning our authorized ROE and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings.\nWe follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plants, and equipment, that are no longer performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information about WEC Energy Group's acquisition of Bluewater and Note 2, Acquisitions, for information on our acquisition of a portion of a wind energy generation facility in Wisconsin.\nExceptional Customer Care\nOur approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. We strive to provide the best value for our customers by embracing constructive change, demonstrating personal responsibility for results, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\nOne example of how we obtain feedback from our customers is through our \"We Care\" calls, where our employees contact customers after a completed service call. Customer satisfaction is a priority, and making \"We Care\" calls is one of the main methods we use to gauge our performance to improve customer satisfaction.\nSafety\nWe have a long-standing commitment to both workplace and public safety, and under our \"Target Zero\" mission, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. We also set goals around injury-prevention activities that raise awareness and facilitate conversations about employee safety. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Earnings\nThe following table compares our consolidated results:\n\nThe table below shows the year-over-year income statement impacts associated with the Tax Legislation signed into law in December 2017. As shown in the table below, the changes related to the Tax Legislation had no impact on net income. See Note 14, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n\nSee below for additional information on the year-over year changes in our consolidated earnings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe discussion below addresses the operating income contribution of our utility segment and includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.\nWe believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our utility segment as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.\n\nOur electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our utility segment operating performance. Our utility segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $267.1 million, $286.7 million, and $253.9 million, respectively. The operating income discussion below includes a table that provides the calculation of electric margins and natural gas margins, along with a reconciliation to utility segment operating income.\nUtility Segment Contribution to Operating Income\nEffective January 1, 2017, we transferred our electric customers located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to UMERC. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information.\n\nThe following table shows a breakdown of other operation and maintenance:\n\n (1) The PSCW has approved escrow accounting for our ATC and MISO network transmission expenses. As a result, we defer as a regulatory asset or liability the difference between actual transmission costs and those included in rates until recovery or refund is authorized in a future rate proceeding. During 2018, 2017, and 2016, $145.2 million, $140.9 million, and $150.7 million, respectively, of costs were billed to us by transmission providers. \n (2) Regulatory amortizations and other pass through expenses are substantially offset in margins and therefore do not have a significant impact on operating income. \n (3) See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information about our earnings sharing mechanism. \n\nThe following tables provide information on delivered volumes by customer class and weather statistics:\n\n\n\n * Normal degree days are based on a 20-year moving average of monthly temperatures from the Green Bay, Wisconsin weather station. \n2018 Compared with 2017\nElectric Utility Margins\nElectric utility margins decreased $11.7 million during 2018, compared with 2017. The significant factors impacting the lower electric utility margins were:\n \u2022 A $17.9 million decrease in margins related to savings from the Tax Legislation that we are required to return to customers through bill credits or reductions in other regulatory assets. See Note 14, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. \n \u2022 A $15.0 million decrease in wholesale margins driven both by lower sales volumes and reduced capacity rates due in part to the Tax Legislation. \nThese decreases in electric utility margins were partially offset by a $22.6 million increase related to higher retail sales volumes during 2018, primarily driven by favorable weather and higher use per residential and large commercial and industrial customer due in part to a stronger economy. Colder winter weather and a warmer summer in 2018 contributed to the increase. As measured by heating degree days, 2018 was 8.8% colder than 2017. As measured by cooling degree days, 2018 was 50.7% warmer than 2017.\n\nNatural Gas Utility Margins\nNatural gas utility margins decreased $3.3 million during 2018, compared with 2017. The most significant factor impacting the lower natural gas utility margins was $6.7 million of savings from the Tax Legislation that we are required to return to customers through bill credits. See Note 14, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. This decrease in natural gas utility margins was partially offset by a $3.7 million increase related to higher sales volumes, primarily driven by colder winter weather, customer growth, and higher use per retail customer due in part to a stronger economy.\nOperating Income\nOperating income at the utility segment decreased $19.6 million during 2018, compared with 2017. The decrease was driven by the $15.0 million decrease in margins discussed above and $4.6 million of higher operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenues taxes).\nThe significant factors impacting the increase in operating expenses during 2018, compared with 2017, were:\n \u2022 A $21.2 million increase in expense related to our earnings sharing mechanism. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. \n \u2022 An $8.5 million increase in benefit costs. \nThese increases in operating expenses were partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $13.4 million decrease in expenses across all of our plants, in part due to the retirement of Edgewater Unit 4 in September 2018 and the retirement of Pulliam Units 7 and 8 in October 2018. This resulted in lower maintenance and labor costs during 2018. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on the plant retirements. \n \u2022 An $8.1 million decrease in electric and natural gas distribution expenses, primarily driven by lower expenses incurred related to storm damage during 2018. \n2017 Compared with 2016\nElectric Utility Margins\nElectric utility margins decreased $10.4 million during 2017, compared with 2016. The significant factors impacting the lower electric utility margins were:\n \u2022 A $15.6 million decrease related to lower retail sales volumes during 2017, primarily driven by the transfer of customers and their related sales to UMERC, the impact of cooler summer weather, and an additional day of sales during 2016 due to leap year. As measured by cooling degree days, 2017 was 21.3% cooler than 2016. \n \u2022 A $4.3 million year-over-year negative impact from collections of fuel and purchased power costs compared with costs approved in rates. Under the Wisconsin fuel rules, our electric margins are impacted by under- or over-collections of certain fuel and purchased power costs that are less than a 2% price variance from the costs included in rates, and the remaining variance that exceeds the 2% variance is deferred. \nPartially offsetting these decreases in electric utility margins was a $10.4 million increase in wholesale margins during 2017, driven by UMERC purchasing a portion of its energy from us.\nNatural Gas Utility Margins\nNatural gas utility margins increased $1.3 million during 2017, compared with 2016. The most significant factor impacting the higher natural gas utility margins was higher retail sales volumes, primarily driven by colder winter weather in 2017.\n\nOperating Income\nOperating income at the utility segment increased $32.8 million during 2017, compared with 2016. The increase was driven by$41.9 million of lower operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenues taxes), partially offset by the $9.1 million net decrease in margins discussed above.\nThe utility segment experienced lower overall operating expenses related to synergy savings resulting from the acquisition of our parent company, Integrys, by WEC Energy Group. The significant factors impacting the decrease in operating expenses during 2017, compared with 2016, which were due in part to synergy savings, were:\n \u2022 A $20.0 million decrease in expenses related to an information technology project completed in 2016 to improve the billing, call center, and credit collection functions of the Integrys subsidiaries, including us. Lower expenses were due in part to a decrease in asset usage charges from WBS, driven by the transfer of this project from WBS to us in 2017. The portion of these lower expenses related to the transfer was offset through higher depreciation and amortization, discussed below. \n \u2022 A $13.5 million decrease in operation and maintenance expenses related to our plants. \n \u2022 A $9.3 million decrease in benefit costs. \n \u2022 An $8.8 million decrease in electric and natural gas distribution expenses, driven by lower metering costs, the transfer of customers and their related sales to UMERC, and other cost savings. \nThese decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $15.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by the completion of the ReACTTM multi-pollutant control system at Weston Unit 3 during the fourth quarter of 2016 and WBS's transfer of the information technology project to us during 2017.\nOther Segment Contribution to Operating Loss\n\nConsolidated Other Income, Net\n\n2018 Compared with 2017\nOther income, net increased by $13.9 million during 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was driven by the 2018 deferral of costs related to the acquisition and ownership of the Forward Wind Energy Center and higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs. See Note 17, Employee Benefits, for more information on our benefit costs.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nOther income, net decreased by $17.6 million during 2017, compared with 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower AFUDC driven by the ReACTTM emission control technology project at Weston Unit 3 going into service during the fourth quarter of 2016. Also contributing to the decrease were lower earnings from our equity method investments due to the transfer of our ownership interest in WPSI to another subsidiary of Integrys effective January 1, 2017. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information.\n\nConsolidated Interest Expense\n\n2017 Compared with 2016\nInterest expense increased by $6.1 million during 2017, compared with 2016, primarily due to a decrease in AFUDC - Debt driven by the ReACTTM emission control technology at Weston Unit 3 placed in service during the fourth quarter of of 2016.\nConsolidated Income Tax Expense\n\n2018 Compared with 2017\nOur effective tax rate was 30.9% in 2018 compared to 39.2% in 2017. This decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Legislation. See Note 14, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nWe expect our 2019 annual effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25%.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nOur effective tax rate was 39.2% in 2017 compared to 36.8% in 2016. This increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits associated with AFUDC - Equity.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows during the years ended December 31:\n\nOperating Activities\n2018 Compared with 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $42.1 million during 2018, compared with 2017, driven by:\n \u2022 A $157.8 million net decrease in cash related to cash received during 2017 for net assets transferred out of our pension plan. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information. \n \u2022 An $18.5 million decrease in cash related to an increase in cash paid for income taxes during 2018, compared with 2017. This decrease in cash was due to a federal income tax refund received in 2017, primarily associated to certain property related tax deductions. \n\n \u2022 An $11.0 million decrease in cash resulting from higher payments during 2018, compared with 2017, for natural gas we purchased to meet the requirements of our customers during the colder winter weather. \nThese decreases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $66.0 million decrease in contributions and payments to our pension and OPEB plans during 2018, compared with 2017. \n \u2022 A $44.6 million increase in cash from lower payments for operating and maintenance expenses. During 2018, our payments related to plant maintenance and labor costs decreased, due in part to the retirement in 2018 of Edgewater Unit 4 and Pulliam Units 7 and 8. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information about the retirement of our plants. In addition, our payments for electric and natural gas distribution costs decreased during 2018. \n \u2022 A $29.6 million increase in cash related to higher overall collections from customers, primarily due to favorable weather during 2018, compared with 2017. \n2017 Compared with 2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $87.6 million during 2017, compared with 2016, driven by:\n \u2022 A $157.8 million increase in cash related to cash received for net assets transferred out of our pension plan during 2017. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information. \n \u2022 A $52.2 million increase in cash related to higher overall collections from customers, primarily due to higher commodity prices. The average per-unit cost of natural gas sold increased 9.7% during 2017, compared with 2016. \n \u2022 A $47.8 million increase in cash from lower payments for operating and maintenance expenses. During 2017, our payments related to transmission, electric and natural gas distribution costs, and operation and maintenance at our plants decreased. \nThese increases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $65.3 million increase in contributions and payments to our pension and OPEB plans during 2017, compared with 2016. \n \u2022 A $62.7 million decrease in cash resulting from higher payments for natural gas and fuel and purchased power, primarily due to higher commodity prices during 2017, compared with 2016. \n \u2022 A $58.0 million net decrease in cash related to $18.1 million of cash paid for income taxes during 2017, compared with $39.9 million of cash received during 2016. This decrease in cash was primarily the result of increased bonus depreciation deductions related to large capital projects in 2016. \nInvesting Activities\n2018 Compared with 2017\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $209.9 million during 2018, compared with 2017, driven by:\n \u2022 A $108.5 million increase in cash paid for capital expenditures during 2018, compared with 2017, which is discussed in more detail below. \n \u2022 The acquisition of a portion of Forward Wind Energy Center during April 2018 for $77.1 million. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information. \n \u2022 A $19.9 million increase in cash paid for software assets received from WBS during 2018, compared with 2017. \n\n2017 Compared with 2016\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $1.6 million during 2017, compared with 2016, driven by a $24.7 million increase in cash paid for capital expenditures, which is discussed in more detail below. This increase was partially offset by a $24.0 million decrease in cash paid for assets received from WBS during 2017, compared with 2016.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\n\n2018 Compared with 2017\nThe increase in cash paid for capital expenditures during 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was driven by higher expenditures for an advanced metering infrastructure program and a natural gas lateral project at our Fox Energy Center.\nSee Capital Resources and Requirements - Capital Requirements - Capital Expenditures and Significant Capital Projects below for more information.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nThe increase in cash paid for capital expenditures during 2017, was driven by higher expenditures for the SMRP. This increase was partially offset by lower expenditures for the ReACTTM emission control technology project at Weston Unit 3, which was completed in 2016, and lower expenditures for upgrades to combustion turbine units at the Fox Energy Center, which were completed in June 2017.\nFinancing Activities\n2018 Compared with 2017\nNet cash related to financing activities increased $248.2 million during 2018, compared with 2017, driven by:\n \u2022 The issuance of $400.0 million of long-term debt during 2018. \n \u2022 A $55.0 million decrease in dividends paid to our parent during 2018, compared with 2017. We paid a special dividend to our parent to balance our capital structure during the first quarter of 2017, driven by cash received for assets transferred out of our pension plan in January 2017. \n \u2022 A $45.0 million increase in equity contributions received from our parent during 2018, compared with 2017, related to balancing our capital structure. \nThese increases in net cash related to financing activities were partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $125.0 million net decrease in cash due to $8.7 million of net repayments of commercial paper during 2018, compared with $116.3 million of net borrowings of commercial paper in 2017. \n \u2022 A $125.0 million decrease in cash related to higher repayments of long-term debt during 2018, compared with 2017. \n2017 Compared with 2016\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $78.2 million during 2017, compared with 2016, driven by:\n \u2022 The repayment of $125.0 million of long-term debt during 2017. \n\n \u2022 A $76.5 million increase in dividends paid to our parent during 2017. We paid a special dividend to our parent to balance our capital structure during the first quarter of 2017, driven by cash received for assets transferred out of our pension plan in January 2017. \n \u2022 A $30.0 million decrease in equity contributions received from our parent during 2017, compared with 2016, related to balancing our capital structure. \nThese increases in net cash used for financing activities were partially offset by:\n \u2022 A $122.3 million net increase in cash due to $116.3 million of net borrowings of commercial paper during 2017, compared with $6.0 million of net repayments of commercial paper in 2016. \n \u2022 A $28.6 million repayment of a loan during 2016. \nSignificant Financing Activities\nFor more information on our financing activities, see Note 12, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, and Note 13, Long-Term Debt.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\nCapital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements for our existing operations through internally generated funds and short-term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long-term debt securities, depending on market conditions and other factors, and equity contributions from our parent.\nWe currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets, and internally generated cash.\nWe maintain a bank back-up credit facility, which provides liquidity support for our obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. See Note 12, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for more information on our credit facility.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants related to outstanding short-term and long-term debt. We expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. See Note 13, Long-Term Debt, for more information about our long-term debt.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2018, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by $157.2 million. We do not expect this to have any impact on our liquidity since we believe we have an adequate back-up line of credit in place for our ongoing operations. We also believe that we can access the capital markets to finance our construction programs and to refinance current maturities of long-term debt, if necessary.\nCredit Rating Risk\nWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. However, we have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts that, in the event of a credit rating downgrade, could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.\n\nIn addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.\nSubject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.\nIf we are unable to successfully take actions to manage any adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments or technical corrections exacerbate the adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, the legislation could result in credit rating agencies placing our credit ratings on negative outlook or downgrading our credit ratings. Any such actions by credit rating agencies may make it more difficult and costly for us to issue future debt securities and certain other types of financing and could increase borrowing costs under our credit facility.\nCapital Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nWe have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018:\n\n (1) The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves, and other estimates. \n (2) Principal and interest payments on long-term debt. \n (3) Energy and transportation purchase obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply, and associated transportation related to utility operations. \n (4) Purchase obligations related to normal business operations, information technology, and other services. \n (5) Obligations for pension and OPEB plans cannot reasonably be estimated beyond 2021. \nThe table above does not reflect estimated future payments related to the manufactured gas plant remediation liability of $90.3 million at December 31, 2018, as the amount and timing of payments are uncertain. We expect to incur costs annually to remediate these sites. See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information about environmental liabilities.\nAROs in the amount of $50.8 million are not included in the above table. Settlement of these liabilities cannot be determined with certainty, but we believe the majority of these liabilities will be settled in more than five years. See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information.\nObligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate-making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.\n\nCapital Expenditures and Significant Capital Projects\nWe have several capital projects that will require significant capital expenditures over the next three years and beyond. All projected capital requirements are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from estimates, depending on a number of factors. These factors include environmental requirements, regulatory restraints and requirements, impacts from the Tax Legislation, additional changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. Our estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are as follows:\n\nWe are continuing work on the SMRP. This project includes modernizing parts of our electric distribution system, including burying or upgrading lines. The project focuses on constructing facilities to improve the reliability of electric service that we provide to our customers. We expect to invest approximately $185 million between 2019 and 2022 on this project. We also continue to upgrade our electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability. These upgrades include the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) program. AMI is an integrated system of smart meters, communication networks and data management systems that enable two-way communication between utilities and customers.\nAdditionally, as part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, we plan to invest in utility scale solar. We have partnered with an unaffiliated utility to acquire ownership interests in two proposed solar projects in Wisconsin. Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and Two Creeks Solar Project will be located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. We will own 100 MW of the output of each project for a total of 200 MW. Our share of the cost of both projects is estimated to be $260 million. Subject to PSCW approval, commercial operation for both projects is targeted for the end of 2020. Solar generation technology has greatly improved, has become more cost-effective, and it complements our summer demand curve.\nCommon Stock Matters\nFor information related to our common stock matters, see Note 10, Common Equity.\nInvestments in Outside Trusts\nWe use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain OPEB obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $871.0 million as of December 31, 2018. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. We contributed $0.7 million, $66.7 million, and $1.4 million to our pension and OPEB plans in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long-term discount rates. For additional information, see Note 17, Employee Benefits.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit that support construction projects, commodity contracts, and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. See Note 1(p), Guarantees, and Note 12, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for more information.\n\nFACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nMarket Risks and Other Significant Risks\nWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environments in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:\nRegulatory Recovery\nWe account for our regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our rates are determined by various regulatory commissions. Our primary regulator is the PSCW.\nRegulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the regulated entity believes the recovery of those costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by the PSCW. Recovery of the deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by the PSCW. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of the deferred costs, including those referenced below, is not approved by the PSCW, the costs would be charged to income in the current period. In general, our regulatory assets are recovered over a period of between one to six years. The PSCW can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, our regulatory assets were $485.9 million, and our regulatory liabilities were $792.9 million.\nDue to the Tax Legislation signed into law in December 2017, we remeasured our deferred taxes and recorded a tax benefit of $444.7 million. We have been returning this tax benefit to ratepayers through bill credits and reductions to other regulatory assets, which we expect to continue. See Note 14, Income Taxes, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nWe expect to request or have requested recovery of the costs related to the following projects discussed in our recent rate proceedings and orders:\n \u2022 In June 2016, the PSCW approved the deferral of costs related to our ReACT\u2122 project above the originally authorized $275.0 million level through 2017. The total cost of the ReACT\u2122 project, excluding $51 million of AFUDC, was $342 million. In September 2017, the PSCW approved an extension of this deferral through 2019 as part of a settlement agreement. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. We will be required to obtain a separate approval for collection of these deferred costs in a future rate case. \n \u2022 Prior to its acquisition by WEC Energy Group, Integrys initiated an information technology project with the goal of improving the customer experience at its subsidiaries, including us. Specifically, the project is expected to provide functional and technological benefits to the billing, call center, and credit collection functions. As of December 31, 2018, we had not received any significant disallowances of the costs incurred for this project. We will be required to obtain approval for the recovery of additional costs incurred through the completion of this long-term project. \nSee Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information regarding recent and pending rate proceedings and orders.\nCommodity Costs\nIn the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs.\nEmbedded within our rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. We have recovery mechanisms in place that allow us to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts. See Item 1. Business - D. Regulation for more information on these mechanisms.\nHigher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. Higher commodity costs combined\n\nwith slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills.\nWeather\nOur utility rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. Our electric utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season and, to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our natural gas utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. The fixed charge included in our natural gas rates helps to mitigate the impacts of weather. A summary of actual weather information in our service territory during 2018, 2017, and 2016, as measured by degree days, may be found in Results of Operations.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. We manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. When it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt.\nBased on our variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of one percentage point would have increased annual interest expense by $2.8 million and $2.9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.\nMarketable Securities Return\nWe use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by the PSCW.\nThe fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately:\n\nFiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.\nWEC Energy Group consults with its investment advisors on an annual basis to help it forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the funds.\nEconomic Conditions\nOur service territories are within the state of Wisconsin. As such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional Midwest economy. In addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.\n\nInflation\nWe continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, and regulatory and environmental compliance in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.\nFor additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCompetitive Markets\nElectric Utility Industry\nThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. The FERC continues to support large RTOs, which affects the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, MISO implemented the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us.\nElectric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date, and it is uncertain when, if at all, retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin.\nNatural Gas Utility Industry\nThe PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of natural gas distribution utilities should change to reflect a competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to provide customer classes with competitive markets the option to choose an alternative retail natural gas supplier. The PSCW has also adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates. All of our Wisconsin customer classes have competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from either an alternative retail natural gas supplier or their local natural gas utility.\nWe offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas from an alternative retail natural gas supplier. Since these transportation customers continue to use our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities, we earn distribution revenues from them. As such, there is little impact on our net income from customers purchasing natural gas from an alternative retail natural gas supplier as natural gas costs are passed through to customers in rates on a one-for-one basis. We are currently unable to predict the impact of potential future industry restructuring on our results of operations or financial position.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, for a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change.\nOther Matters\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nIn December 2017, the Tax Legislation was signed into law. The PSCW issued a written order in May 2018 regarding how to refund certain tax savings from the Tax Legislation to our ratepayers. We are also working with the FERC to modify our formula rate tariffs for the impacts of the Tax Legislation, and we expect to receive FERC approval for the modified tariffs in 2019. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n\nBonus Depreciation Provisions\nBonus depreciation is an additional amount of first-year tax deductible depreciation that is awarded above what would normally be available. The bonus depreciation deduction available for public utility property subject to rate-making by a government entity or public utility commission was modified by the Tax Legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017. Based on the provisions of the Tax Legislation, bonus depreciation can no longer be deducted for public utility property acquired and placed in service after December 31, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.\nThe following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\nGoodwill\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test for our utility reporting unit as of July 1, 2018, and no impairment was recorded as a result of this test. At July 1, 2018, our utility reporting unit had $36.4 million of goodwill. The fair value calculated in step one of the test was greater than carrying value. The fair value of our reporting unit was calculated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.\nFor the income approach, we used internal forecasts to project cash flows. Any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the calculated fair value of a reporting unit. Since our reporting unit is regulated, a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed. An unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair value of our reporting unit to decrease.\nKey assumptions used in the income approach included ROE, the long-term growth rate used to determine the terminal value at the end of the discrete forecast period, and the discount rate. The discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach. As interest rates rise, the calculated fair value will decrease. The discount rate is based on the weighted-average cost of capital, taking into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. The terminal year ROE is driven by our current allowed ROE. The terminal growth rate is based primarily on a combination of our service area's historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income.\nFor the market approach, we used an equal weighting of the guideline public company method and the guideline merged and acquired company method. The guideline public company method uses financial metrics from similar publicly traded companies to determine fair value. The guideline merged and acquired company method calculates fair value by analyzing the actual prices paid for recent mergers and acquisitions in the industry. We applied multiples derived from these two methods to the appropriate operating metrics for our reporting unit to determine fair value.\nThe underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment test were made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the result of the test.\nThe fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by over 50%. Based on this result, our reporting unit is not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.\nLong-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long-lived assets may not be recoverable.\n\nExamples of events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price, a significant change in use, adverse legal factors or a change in business climate, operating or cash flow losses, or an expectation that the asset might be sold. These assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management. The long-lived assets assessed for impairment generally include certain assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from our customers as a result of regulatory decisions that will be made in the future.\nWe have evaluated future plans for our older and less efficient fossil fuel generating units and have retired certain generating units. In accordance with ASC 980-360, Regulated Operations - Property, Plant, and Equipment, when it becomes probable that a generating unit will be retired before the end of its useful life, we assess whether the generating unit meets the criteria for abandonment accounting. Generating units that are considered probable of abandonment are expected to cease operations in the near term, significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. As a result, the remaining net book value of these assets can be significant. If a generating unit meets applicable criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, and after the unit is abandoned, we assess the likelihood of recovery of the remaining carrying value of that generating unit at the end of each reporting period. If it becomes probable that regulators will disallow full recovery as well as a return on the remaining net book value of a generating unit that is either abandoned or probable of being abandoned, an impairment loss may be required. An impairment loss would be recorded if the remaining carrying value of the generating unit is greater than the present value of the amount expected to be recovered from ratepayers.\nPulliam Units 7 and 8 and the jointly-owned Edgewater 4 generating unit were retired during 2018. We plan to ask for full cost recovery of and a full return on the remaining book value of these generating units and have concluded that no impairment was required related to these assets as of December 31, 2018. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on our retired generating units, including various approvals we have received from the FERC.\nPension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and OPEB, described in Note 17, Employee Benefits, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.\nPension and OPEB costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and OPEB costs.\nPension and OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. We believe that such changes in costs would be recovered or refunded through the ratemaking process.\nThe following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\n\n\nThe following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated OPEB obligation and the reported net periodic OPEB cost. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\n\nThe discount rates are selected based on hypothetical bond portfolios consisting of noncallable (or callable with make-whole provisions), noncollateralized, high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum. The bonds are generally rated \"Aa\" with a minimum amount outstanding of $50.0 million. From the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments.\nWe establish our expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 7.25% in 2018, 2017, and 2016. The actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was (5.9)%, 16.31%, and 8.79%, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nIn selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. For more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and OPEB, see Note 17, Employee Benefits.\nRegulatory Accounting\nOur utility operations follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the PSCW. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by the PSCW.\nFuture recovery of regulatory assets is not assured and is generally subject to review by the PSCW in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings from our electric and natural gas utility operations, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.\nThe application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer met the criteria for application. Our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred. As of December 31, 2018, we had $485.9 million in regulatory assets and $792.9 million in regulatory liabilities. See Note 5, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information.\nUnbilled Revenues\nWe record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the\n\naccuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2018 of approximately $1.5 billion included accrued utility revenues of $67.1 million as of December 31, 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. We also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in our income statements.\nUncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income tax benefits that meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

results of operations of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPS), an electric and natural gas utility subsidiary of WEC Energy Group. WPS generates revenue through the distribution and sale of electricity and natural gas, along with providing wholesale electric service. Key developments include the transfer of Upper Peninsula of Michigan customers and assets to UMERC, and the reorganization of its ownership interest in entities such as WPSI and ATC.\n\nWPS's strategic focus is on improving reliability, operating efficiency, financial discipline, customer care, and safety. As part of WEC Energy Group's generation portfolio reshaping plan, WPS aims to balance reliability, customer cost, and environmental stewardship. They emphasize reducing customer costs, preserving fuel diversity, and lowering carbon emissions. They have committed to reducing CO2 emissions by 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 and have further goals for 2050. The plan includes retiring coal-fired generation units and investing in natural gas and solar generation projects.\n\nSignificant investments for reliability include advanced metering infrastructure and upgrades to distribution networks. Operating efficiency efforts include IT infrastructure consolidation to drive operational efficiency. Financial discipline revolves around maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Customer care focuses on exceptional service and leverages capabilities such as \"We Care\" calls to gauge performance. WPS also prioritizes workplace and public safety with ambitious goals and programs.\n\nThe results of operations section outline the company's financial performance, comparing revenue, cost, and net income data across the years 2016\u20132018. This includes a year-over-year analysis of consolidated earnings and the impact of the Tax Legislation enacted in December 2017. Other income, interest expense, and income tax expense are discussed, as are cash flows related to operating, investing, and financing activities.\n\nThe cash flow statement indicates an increase in cash used for investing due to capital expenditures and acquisitions, while financing activities saw a rise due to long-term debt issuance and fewer dividends paid to the parent company.\n\nLooking forward, WPS anticipates its capital resources needs will come from a combination of internal funds, short-term borrowings, and potential issuance of debt securities or equity contributions. The utility's ongoing and future capital expenditures include smart meters, grid modernization projects, and investments in renewable energy sources.\n\nAdditionally, the report delves into market risks such as regulatory dependence, commodity costs, interest rates, and weather impacts, as well as economic conditions and inflation. Critical accounting policies include aspects related to goodwill, long-lived assets, pension and OPEB obligations, regulatory accounting, unbilled revenues, and income tax expense.\n\nFinally, the report discusses factors affecting liquidity and capital resources, emphasizes regulatory recovery, and mentions potential infrastructural and environmental obligations."}
