Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on January 30, 2016, January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, respectively. Each fiscal year consisted of 52 weeks. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nExecutive Overview\nJ.Crew is an internationally recognized multi-brand apparel and accessories retailer that differentiates itself through high standards of quality, style, design and fabrics. We are a vertically-integrated, omni-channel specialty retailer that operates stores and websites both domestically and internationally. We design, market and sell our products, including those under the J.Crew\u00ae and Madewell\u00ae brands, offering complete assortments of women's, men's and children's apparel and accessories.\nA summary of our revenues by brand is as follows:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> J.Crew\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,146.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,295.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,212.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Madewell\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 301.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 245.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 181.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,505.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,579.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,428.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Consists primarily of shipping and handling fees and revenues from third-party resellers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of January 30, 2016, we operated 287 J.Crew retail stores, 161 J.Crew factory stores (including 10 J.Crew Mercantile stores), and 103 Madewell stores throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and France; compared to 280 J.Crew retail stores, 139 J.Crew factory stores, and 85 Madewell stores as of January 31, 2015.\nA summary of highlights for fiscal 2015 is as follows:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Revenues decreased 2.9% to $2,505.8 million, with comparable company sales down 8.2%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> J.Crew revenues decreased 6.5% to $2,146.7 million, with comparable J.Crew sales down 9.9%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Madewell revenues increased 22.7% to $301.0 million, with comparable Madewell sales up 7.8%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We recorded non-cash impairment losses of $1,382 million, a result of write downs of (i) goodwill of $1,017 million, (ii) intangible assets of $360 million, and (iii) certain long-lived assets of $5 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We opened 11 J.Crew retail stores, 22 J.Crew factory stores (including 10 J.Crew Mercantile stores), and 18 Madewell stores.

A key measure used in evaluating our business is comparable company sales. We also consider gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses in assessing the performance of our business.\nNet Sales\nNet sales reflect our revenues from the sale of our merchandise less returns and discounts. We aggregate our merchandise into four sales categories: (i) women's apparel, (ii) men's apparel, (iii) children's apparel, and (iv) accessories, which include shoes, socks, jewelry, handbags, belts and hair accessories. The approximate percentage of our sales by these four categories is as follows:\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apparel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Women's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Men's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Children's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accessories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparable Company Sales\nComparable company sales reflect: (i) net sales at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, (ii) e-commerce net sales, and (iii) shipping and handling fees, which are recorded as other revenues on our statements of operations. Comparable company sales exclude net sales from: (i) new stores that have not been open for 12 months, (ii) the 53rd week, if applicable, (iii) stores that experience a square footage change of at least 15 percent, (iv) stores that have been temporarily closed for at least 30 consecutive days, (v) permanently closed stores, (vi) temporary pop up\u201d stores and (vii) revenue from third party resellers.\nMeasuring the change in year-over-year comparable company sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our business. Various factors affect comparable company sales, including:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> consumer preferences, fashion trends, buying trends and overall economic trends,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> competition,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> changes in our merchandise mix,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> pricing,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the level of customer service that we provide,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our ability to source and distribute products efficiently, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the number of stores we open, close (including on a temporary basis for renovations) and expand in any period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCyclicality and Seasonality\nOur industry is cyclical and our revenues are affected by general economic conditions. Purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and consumer confidence.\nOur business is seasonal and as a result, our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have four distinct selling seasons that align with our four fiscal quarters. Revenues are usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter, particularly in December when customers make holiday purchases. In fiscal 2015, we realized approximately 28% of our revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is determined by subtracting our cost of goods sold from our revenues. Cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, freight, design, buying and production costs, occupancy costs related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and all shipping costs associated with our e-commerce business. Cost of goods sold varies directly with revenues, and therefore, is usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter. Cost of goods sold also changes as we expand or contract our store base and incur higher or lower store occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our revenues.\nOur gross profit may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold while others, like us, exclude all or a portion of them from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include all operating expenses not included in cost of goods sold, primarily catalog production and mailing costs, certain warehousing expenses, administrative payroll, store expenses other than occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, and credit card fees. These expenses do not necessarily vary proportionally with net sales.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our operating results as a percentage of revenues as well as selected store data:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold, including buying and occupancy costs(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on refinancings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selected company data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> J.Crew:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of stores open at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Store sales per gross square foot\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in J.Crew comparable sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Madewell:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of stores open at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Store sales per gross square foot\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in Madewell comparable sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We exclude a portion of our distribution network costs from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Comparable company sales decreased 8.2% following a decrease of 0.7% last year.\nJ.Crew sales decreased $148.4 million, or 6.5%, to $2,146.7 million from $2,295.1 million last year. J.Crew comparable sales decreased 9.9% following a decrease of 1.9% last year. In fiscal 2015, we saw a continuing softening of the sales trend in our J.Crew women's apparel.\nMadewell sales increased $55.7 million, or 22.7%, to $301.0 million from $245.3 million last year. Madewell comparable sales increased 7.8% following an increase of 14.1% last year.\nOther revenues increased $18.8 million, or 48.1%, to $58.1 million in fiscal 2015 from $39.3 million last year, primarily a result of revenue from third party resellers.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased $75.3 million to $895.6 million in fiscal 2015 from $970.9 million last year.

As a result of current and expected future operating results, we concluded that the carrying value of the J.Crew reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Therefore, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of (i) $1,017 million related to goodwill and (ii) $360 million related to the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name.\nAfter recording the impairment charges, the carrying value of goodwill is $108 million, which entirely relates to the Madewell reporting unit. There is no remaining goodwill attributable to the J.Crew reporting unit. The carrying value of the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name is $380.0 million at January 30, 2016. If operating results continue to decline below our expectations, additional impairment charges may be recorded in the future.\nA summary of the aggregate impairment losses is as follows:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill allocated to the J.Crew reporting unit\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,016.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 562.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intangible asset related to the J.Crew trade name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 360.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 145.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-lived assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,381.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 710.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese impairment charges do not have an effect on our operations, liquidity or financial covenants, and do not change management's long-term strategy, which includes its plans to drive disciplined growth across our brands.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased $4.6 million to $69.8 million in fiscal 2015 from $74.4 million last year driven primarily by the redemption of our 8.125% senior notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes\u201d), which occurred in the first quarter of last year.

The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate in each fiscal year was driven primarily by the non-cash impairment charges related to the write off of goodwill, which is not tax deductible, and therefore has no tax benefit. Other items impacting the effective rates include state and local income taxes, benefits of lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, offset by the recognition of certain foreign valuation allowances.\nNet Loss\nNet loss increased $584.9 million to $1,242.7 million in fiscal 2015 from $657.8 million last year. This increase was due to: (i) an increase in impairment losses of $671.6 million, (ii) a decrease in gross profit of $75.3 million, offset by (iii) an increase in the benefit for income taxes of $86.7 million, (iv) a loss on refinancing in the prior year of $59.0 million, (v) a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $11.9 million and (vi) a decrease in interest expense of $4.6 million.\nResults of Operations-Fiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Variance\nIncrease / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,579.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,428.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 151.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 970.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,006.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 846.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 754.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 710.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 708.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (585.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 249.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (834.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on refinancings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (118.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (657.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (745.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased $151.4 million, or 6.2%, to $2,579.7 million in fiscal 2014 from $2,428.3 million in fiscal 2013, driven primarily by an increase in sales of (i) men's apparel, specifically shirts, suiting, and knits and (ii) women's apparel, specifically knits, jackets, and pants.

The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate was driven primarily by the non-cash impairment charge related to the write off of goodwill, which is not tax deductible, and therefore has no tax benefit. Other items impacting the effective rate include state and local income taxes, benefits of lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, offset by the recognition of certain foreign valuation allowances.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 39.4%. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate was driven primarily by state and local income taxes, offset by certain federal tax credits.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income (loss) decreased $745.9 million to a net loss of $657.8 million in fiscal 2014 from net income of $88.1 million in fiscal 2013. This decrease was due to: (i) impairment losses of $708.1 million, (ii) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $91.7 million, (iii) the loss on refinancings of $59.0 million, and (iv) a decrease in gross profit of $35.2 million, partially offset by (v) a decrease in the provision for income taxes of $118.2 million and (vi) a decrease in interest expense of $29.8 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under the ABL Facility. Our primary cash needs are (i) capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores and remodeling our existing stores, investments in our distribution network, making information technology system enhancements, (ii) meeting debt service requirements (including paying dividends to an indirect parent company, when required, for the purposes of servicing debt - see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements) and (iii) funding working capital requirements. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts payable and other current liabilities.

debt.\nFinancing Arrangements\nABL Facility\nWe have an ABL Facility, which is governed by a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the other agents and lenders, which provides for a $350 million senior secured asset-based revolving line of credit (which may be increased by up to $25 million in certain circumstances), subject to a borrowing base limitation. On December 17, 2015, we amended the ABL Facility to increase the revolving credit commitments from $300 million to $350 million. The borrowing base under the ABL Facility equals the sum of : 90% of the eligible credit card receivables; plus, 85% of eligible accounts; plus, 90% (or 92.5% for the period of August 1 through December 31 of any fiscal year) of the net recovery percentage of eligible inventory multiplied by the cost of eligible inventory; plus, 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible letters of credit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible letter of credit inventory; plus, 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible in-transit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible in-transit inventory; plus, 100% of qualified cash; minus, all availability and inventory reserves. The ABL Facility includes borrowing capacity in the forms of letters of credit up to $300 million, and up to $25 million in U.S. dollars for loans on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, and is available in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. Any amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are due and payable in full on the maturity date of December 10, 2019.\nOn January 30, 2016, standby letters of credit were $18.7 million, excess availability, as defined, was $331.3 million, and there were no borrowings outstanding. Average short-term borrowings under the ABL Facility were $17.5 million and $1.7 million in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\nSee note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the terms of the ABL Facility.\nDemand Letter of Credit Facilities\nWe have unsecured, demand letter of credit facilities with HSBC and Bank of America which provide for the issuance of up to $50 million and $20 million, respectively, of documentary letters of credit on a no fee basis. On January 30, 2016, outstanding documentary letters of credit were $12.4 million and aggregate availability under these facilities was $57.6 million.\nTerm Loan\nOn March 5, 2014, we refinanced our Term Loan Facility, the proceeds of which were used to (i) refinance amounts outstanding under the former term loan facility of $1,167 million and (ii) together with cash on hand, redeem in full the outstanding Senior Notes of $400 million, and to pay fees, call premiums and accrued interest to the date of redemption, pursuant to the indenture governing the Senior Notes. The maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is March 5, 2021.\nWe are required to make principal repayments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility, or $3.9 million, on the last business day of January, April, July, and October, which commenced in July 2014. We are also required to repay the term loan based on annual excess cash flow, as defined in the agreement beginning in fiscal 2014.\nThe interest rate on the $1,540 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility was 4.00% on January 30, 2016.\nSee note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the terms of the Term Loan Facility.\nPIK Notes\nOn November 4, 2013, Chinos Intermediate Holdings A, Inc. (the Issuer\u201d), an indirect parent holding company of Group, issued $500 million aggregate principal of 7.75/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due May 1, 2019 (the PIK Notes\u201d). The PIK Notes are (i) senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the Issuer's subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in our financial statements. In fiscal 2015, we paid dividends of $38 million in the aggregate to the Issuer to fund the semi-annual interest payments due May 1, 2015 and November 1, 2015.\nOn October 30, 2015, the Issuer delivered notice to U.S. Bank N.A., as trustee, under the indenture governing the PIK Notes, that with respect to the interest that will be due on such notes on the May 2, 2016 interest payment date, the Issuer will make such interest payment by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. The PIK election will increase the outstanding principal balance of the PIK Notes by $21.3 million to $521.3 million. Therefore, we will not pay a dividend to the Issuer in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the PIK Notes, the Issuer intends to evaluate this option prior to the beginning of each interest period based on relevant factors at that time.\nOutlook\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from (i) capital expenditures, (ii) debt service requirements, including required (a) quarterly principal repayments, (b) repayments, if any, based on annual excess cash flows, if any, as defined and (c) dividends to the Issuer, when required, for the purposes of servicing debt, and (iii) working capital. Management anticipates that capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 will be approximately $95 to $105 million, including $40 to $45 million for new stores, $35 to $40 million for information technology enhancements, $10 to $15 million for warehouse and corporate office improvements, and the remainder for store renovations and general corporate purposes. Management expects to pay interest of approximately $73 million in fiscal 2016, excluding any payments of dividends to the Issuer to fund debt service obligations. Management believes that our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, projected cash flow from operations and amounts available under the ABL Facility will be adequate to fund our primary short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Our ability to satisfy these obligations and to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our financing arrangements, depends on our future operating performance, which in turn, may be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in part II of this report.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase, directly or indirectly, our outstanding indebtedness, including the PIK Notes, through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such purchases and/or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, which could impact our capital structure, the market for our debt securities, the price of the indebtedness being purchased and/or exchanged and affect our liquidity.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate a portion of our international purchase of merchandise. We also enter into standby letters of credit to secure reimbursement obligations under certain insurance and import programs and lease obligations. As of January 30, 2016, we had the following obligations under letters of credit in future periods.\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> Letters of Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td>

While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2015, a pronouncement was issued that requires entities to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We adopted this pronouncement on January 30, 2016. The adoption of this guidance required changes in presentation only and therefore did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption resulted in the reclassification of $19,280 from current assets to long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2015.\nIn May 2014, a pronouncement was issued that clarified the principles of revenue recognition, which standardizes a comprehensive model for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, a pronouncement was issued that requires certain debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction of the carrying amount of that debt liability. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, a pronouncement was issued that more closely aligns the measurement of inventory in U.S. GAAP with International Financial Reporting Standards by requiring companies using the first-in, first-out and average costs methods to measure inventory using the lower of cost and net realizable value. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, a pronouncement was issued that requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with accounting lease terms of more than 12 months. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. While we are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements, the adoption is expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent consolidated results of operations. For more information on our accounting policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> We recognize sales made in our stores at the point of sale, and sales through our e-commerce business at an estimated date of receipt by the customer.

We defer revenue and recognize a liability for gift cards issued in connection with our customer loyalty program. Any unredeemed loyalty gift cards are recognized as income in the period in which they expire.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInventory Valuation\nMerchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value. We capitalize certain design, purchasing and warehousing costs in inventory. We evaluate all of our inventories to determine excess inventories based on estimated future sales. Excess inventories may be disposed of through our e-commerce business, factory stores and other liquidation methods. Based on historical results experienced through various methods of disposition, we write down the carrying value of inventories that are not expected to be sold at or above cost. Additionally, we reduce the cost of inventories based on an estimate of lost or stolen items each period.\nDeferred Catalog Costs\nThe costs associated with direct response advertising, which consist primarily of catalog production and mailing costs, are capitalized and amortized over the expected future revenue stream of the catalog mailings, which we currently estimate to be two months. The expected future revenue stream is determined based on historical revenue trends developed over an extended period of time. If the current revenue streams were to diverge from the expected trend, our amortization of deferred catalog costs would be adjusted accordingly.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the J.Crew trade name and goodwill, are not subject to amortization. The Company assesses the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangibles whenever there are indicators of impairment, or at least annually in the fourth quarter. If the recorded carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company records a charge to write the intangible asset down to its fair value. Definite-lived intangibles, such as the Madewell trade name, loyalty program, customer lists and favorable lease commitments, are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful life or remaining lease term.\nWe assess the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, which consists of our operating segments, J.Crew and Madewell. In this assessment, we first compare the estimated enterprise fair value of each of our reporting units to its recorded carrying value. We estimate the enterprise fair value based on a combination of an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow, a market approach, and a transaction approach. If the recorded carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated enterprise fair value in the first step, a second step is performed in which we allocate the enterprise fair value to the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets. The second step of the impairment testing process requires, among other things, estimates of fair values of substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. Any enterprise fair value in excess of amounts allocated to such net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill for that reporting unit. If the recorded goodwill balance for a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write goodwill down to its fair value.\nIn fiscal 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of (i) $1,017 million related to goodwill and (ii) $360 million related to the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name. The remaining goodwill of $108 million on our balance sheet at January 30, 2016 relates entirely to the Madewell reporting unit. There is no remaining goodwill attributable to the J.Crew reporting unit. The carrying value of the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name is $380.0 million at January 30, 2016. If operating results continue to decline below the Company's expectations, additional impairment charges may be recorded in the future.\nFixed Asset Impairment\nWe are exposed to potential impairment if the book value of our assets exceeds their expected undiscounted future cash flows. The major components of our long-lived assets are store fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements. We test for impairment at the store level and the net book value is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected discounted future net cash flows is less than net book value.\nIn fiscal 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $4,522 related to certain long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes\nAn asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred taxes are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred taxes are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance.\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the net deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, a valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined unrealizable, any valuation allowance would be reversed into income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of current and deferred taxes involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectation could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWith respect to uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return, we recognize in our financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not\u201d threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement.\nIt is our intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings and profits from our foreign operations that have been generated through January 30, 2016. Future plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the foreign amounts to fund U.S. operations. Cumulative undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries were $46.4 million at January 30, 2016. No deferred federal income taxes were provided for the undistributed earnings as they are permanently reinvested in our international operations. Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is $22.7 million, valued in U.S. dollars, at January 30, 2016.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of employee share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense in the statement of operations. Determining the fair value of options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility and the expected dividend yield. Upon grant of awards, we also estimate an amount of forfeitures that will occur prior to vesting. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from the estimates, share-based compensation expense could be materially impacted.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe financial statements of the Company's foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, equity accounts at historical exchange rates, while revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income, but are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness. As cash flow hedges, unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. The interest rate swap agreements are highly correlated to the changes in interest rates to which the Company is exposed. Unrealized gains and losses on this instrument are designated as effective or ineffective. The effective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, while the ineffective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of interest expense. Future realized gains and losses in connection with each required interest payment are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss to interest expense.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during each of the years in a three-year period ended January 30, 2016. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on January 30, 2016, January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, respectively. Each fiscal year consisted of 52 weeks. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nExecutive Overview\nJ.Crew is an internationally recognized multi-brand apparel and accessories retailer that differentiates itself through high standards of quality, style, design and fabrics. We are a vertically-integrated, omni-channel specialty retailer that operates stores and websites both domestically and internationally. We design, market and sell our products, including those under the J.Crew\u00ae and Madewell\u00ae brands, offering complete assortments of women's, men's and children's apparel and accessories.\nA summary of our revenues by brand is as follows:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> J.Crew\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,146.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,295.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,212.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Madewell\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 301.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 245.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 181.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,505.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,579.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,428.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Consists primarily of shipping and handling fees and revenues from third-party resellers. \nAs of January 30, 2016, we operated 287 J.Crew retail stores, 161 J.Crew factory stores (including 10 J.Crew Mercantile stores), and 103 Madewell stores throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and France; compared to 280 J.Crew retail stores, 139 J.Crew factory stores, and 85 Madewell stores as of January 31, 2015.\nA summary of highlights for fiscal 2015 is as follows:\n \u00b7 Revenues decreased 2.9% to $2,505.8 million, with comparable company sales down 8.2%. \n \u00b7 J.Crew revenues decreased 6.5% to $2,146.7 million, with comparable J.Crew sales down 9.9%. \n \u00b7 Madewell revenues increased 22.7% to $301.0 million, with comparable Madewell sales up 7.8%. \n \u00b7 We recorded non-cash impairment losses of $1,382 million, a result of write downs of (i) goodwill of $1,017 million, (ii) intangible assets of $360 million, and (iii) certain long-lived assets of $5 million. \n \u00b7 We opened 11 J.Crew retail stores, 22 J.Crew factory stores (including 10 J.Crew Mercantile stores), and 18 Madewell stores. We closed four J.Crew retail stores. \n \u00b7 We initiated a workforce reduction as part of a cost reduction program. We incurred a pre-tax charge of $4.8 million for severance and related costs, which will result in annualized pre-tax savings of payroll and related costs of approximately $17 million. \nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. A key measure used in evaluating our business is comparable company sales. We also consider gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses in assessing the performance of our business.\nNet Sales\nNet sales reflect our revenues from the sale of our merchandise less returns and discounts. We aggregate our merchandise into four sales categories: (i) women's apparel, (ii) men's apparel, (iii) children's apparel, and (iv) accessories, which include shoes, socks, jewelry, handbags, belts and hair accessories. The approximate percentage of our sales by these four categories is as follows:\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apparel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Women's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Men's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Children's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accessories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparable Company Sales\nComparable company sales reflect: (i) net sales at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, (ii) e-commerce net sales, and (iii) shipping and handling fees, which are recorded as other revenues on our statements of operations. Comparable company sales exclude net sales from: (i) new stores that have not been open for 12 months, (ii) the 53rd week, if applicable, (iii) stores that experience a square footage change of at least 15 percent, (iv) stores that have been temporarily closed for at least 30 consecutive days, (v) permanently closed stores, (vi) temporary pop up\u201d stores and (vii) revenue from third party resellers.\nMeasuring the change in year-over-year comparable company sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our business. Various factors affect comparable company sales, including:\n \u00b7 consumer preferences, fashion trends, buying trends and overall economic trends, \n \u00b7 competition, \n \u00b7 changes in our merchandise mix, \n \u00b7 pricing, \n \u00b7 the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events, \n \u00b7 the level of customer service that we provide, \n \u00b7 our ability to source and distribute products efficiently, and \n \u00b7 the number of stores we open, close (including on a temporary basis for renovations) and expand in any period. \nCyclicality and Seasonality\nOur industry is cyclical and our revenues are affected by general economic conditions. Purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and consumer confidence.\nOur business is seasonal and as a result, our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have four distinct selling seasons that align with our four fiscal quarters. Revenues are usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter, particularly in December when customers make holiday purchases. In fiscal 2015, we realized approximately 28% of our revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is determined by subtracting our cost of goods sold from our revenues. Cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, freight, design, buying and production costs, occupancy costs related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and all shipping costs associated with our e-commerce business. Cost of goods sold varies directly with revenues, and therefore, is usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter. Cost of goods sold also changes as we expand or contract our store base and incur higher or lower store occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our revenues.\nOur gross profit may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold while others, like us, exclude all or a portion of them from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include all operating expenses not included in cost of goods sold, primarily catalog production and mailing costs, certain warehousing expenses, administrative payroll, store expenses other than occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, and credit card fees. These expenses do not necessarily vary proportionally with net sales.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our operating results as a percentage of revenues as well as selected store data:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold, including buying and occupancy costs(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on refinancings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selected company data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> J.Crew:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of stores open at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Store sales per gross square foot\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in J.Crew comparable sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Madewell:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of stores open at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Store sales per gross square foot\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in Madewell comparable sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We exclude a portion of our distribution network costs from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Madewell comparable sales increased 7.8% following an increase of 14.1% last year.\nOther revenues increased $18.8 million, or 48.1%, to $58.1 million in fiscal 2015 from $39.3 million last year, primarily a result of revenue from third party resellers.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased $75.3 million to $895.6 million in fiscal 2015 from $970.9 million last year. This decrease resulted from the following factors:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/\n(decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease in revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease in merchandise margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in buying and occupancy costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease in gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (75.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross margin decreased to 35.7% in fiscal 2015 from 37.6% last year. The decrease in gross margin was driven by: (i) a 110 basis point deterioration in merchandise margin due to increased markdowns and (ii) an 80 basis point increase in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues, primarily driven by 47 net new stores.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $11.9 million, or 1.4%, to $834.1 million in fiscal 2015 from $846.0 million last year.

As a result of current and expected future operating results, we concluded that the carrying value of the J.Crew reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Therefore, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of (i) $1,017 million related to goodwill and (ii) $360 million related to the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name.\nAfter recording the impairment charges, the carrying value of goodwill is $108 million, which entirely relates to the Madewell reporting unit. There is no remaining goodwill attributable to the J.Crew reporting unit. The carrying value of the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name is $380.0 million at January 30, 2016. If operating results continue to decline below our expectations, additional impairment charges may be recorded in the future.\nA summary of the aggregate impairment losses is as follows:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill allocated to the J.Crew reporting unit\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,016.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 562.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intangible asset related to the J.Crew trade name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 360.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 145.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-lived assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,381.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 710.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese impairment charges do not have an effect on our operations, liquidity or financial covenants, and do not change management's long-term strategy, which includes its plans to drive disciplined growth across our brands.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased $4.6 million to $69.8 million in fiscal 2015 from $74.4 million last year driven primarily by the redemption of our 8.125% senior notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes\u201d), which occurred in the first quarter of last year.

The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate in each fiscal year was driven primarily by the non-cash impairment charges related to the write off of goodwill, which is not tax deductible, and therefore has no tax benefit. Other items impacting the effective rates include state and local income taxes, benefits of lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, offset by the recognition of certain foreign valuation allowances.\nNet Loss\nNet loss increased $584.9 million to $1,242.7 million in fiscal 2015 from $657.8 million last year. This increase was due to: (i) an increase in impairment losses of $671.6 million, (ii) a decrease in gross profit of $75.3 million, offset by (iii) an increase in the benefit for income taxes of $86.7 million, (iv) a loss on refinancing in the prior year of $59.0 million, (v) a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $11.9 million and (vi) a decrease in interest expense of $4.6 million.\nResults of Operations-Fiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Variance\nIncrease / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,579.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,428.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 151.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 970.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,006.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 846.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 754.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 710.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 708.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (585.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 249.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (834.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on refinancings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (118.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (657.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (745.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased $151.4 million, or 6.2%, to $2,579.7 million in fiscal 2014 from $2,428.3 million in fiscal 2013, driven primarily by an increase in sales of (i) men's apparel, specifically shirts, suiting, and knits and (ii) women's apparel, specifically knits, jackets, and pants.

J.Crew comparable sales decreased 1.9% following an increase of 2.7% last year.\nMadewell sales increased $63.9 million, or 35.2%, to $245.3 million in fiscal 2014 from $181.4 million in fiscal 2013. Madewell comparable sales increased 14.1% in fiscal 2014 following an increase of 9.1% in fiscal 2013.\nOther revenues, which consisted primarily of shipping and handling fees, increased $5.1 million, or 14.8%, to $39.3 million in fiscal 2014 from $34.2 million in fiscal 2013.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased $35.2 million to $970.9 million in fiscal 2014 from $1,006.1 million in fiscal 2013. This decrease resulted from the following factors:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/\n(decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Decrease in merchandise margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in buying and occupancy costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total decrease in gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (35.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross margin decreased to 37.6% in fiscal 2014 from 41.4% in fiscal 2013. The decrease in gross margin was driven by: (i) a 330 basis point deterioration in merchandise margin due to increased markdowns and (ii) a 50 basis point increase in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $91.7 million, or 12.1%, to $846.0 million in fiscal 2014 from $754.3 million in fiscal 2013. This increase primarily resulted from the following:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in operating expenses, primarily store expenses and payroll\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in advertising and catalog costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency transaction losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in share-based and incentive compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance proceeds received in the prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total increase in selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 32.8% in fiscal 2014 from 31.1% in fiscal 2013.\nImpairment Losses\nThe impairment losses recorded in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were the result of the write-down of the following assets:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill allocated to the Stores reporting unit\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 562.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intangible asset related to the J.Crew trade name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 145.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-lived assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 710.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we changed our operating segments and reporting units to align with our omni-channel strategy, which focuses on providing a seamless approach to the customer experience through all available sales channels. Prior to such change, as a multi-channel retailer, we allocated resources to our channels, Stores and Direct. As an omni-channel retailer, we allocate resources to our brands. Accordingly, we changed our operating segments to J.Crew and Madewell, which have been aggregated into one reportable segment. At the end of fiscal 2014, the goodwill allocated to the J.Crew and Madewell reporting units was $1,017 million and $108 million, respectively.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased $29.8 million to $74.4 million in fiscal 2014 from $104.2 million in fiscal 2013 driven primarily by the redemption of our Senior Notes.

In connection with these refinancings, we recorded a loss of $59.0 million, the components of which are as follows:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prior unrealized losses on cash flow hedge\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Call premium on Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Write-off of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on refinancings\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 8.4%. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate was driven primarily by the non-cash impairment charge related to the write off of goodwill, which is not tax deductible, and therefore has no tax benefit. Other items impacting the effective rate include state and local income taxes, benefits of lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, offset by the recognition of certain foreign valuation allowances.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 39.4%. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate was driven primarily by state and local income taxes, offset by certain federal tax credits.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income (loss) decreased $745.9 million to a net loss of $657.8 million in fiscal 2014 from net income of $88.1 million in fiscal 2013. This decrease was due to: (i) impairment losses of $708.1 million, (ii) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $91.7 million, (iii) the loss on refinancings of $59.0 million, and (iv) a decrease in gross profit of $35.2 million, partially offset by (v) a decrease in the provision for income taxes of $118.2 million and (vi) a decrease in interest expense of $29.8 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under the ABL Facility. Our primary cash needs are (i) capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores and remodeling our existing stores, investments in our distribution network, making information technology system enhancements, (ii) meeting debt service requirements (including paying dividends to an indirect parent company, when required, for the purposes of servicing debt - see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements) and (iii) funding working capital requirements. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts payable and other current liabilities.

million in fiscal 2014 resulting from (i) costs paid in connection with the refinancings of debt, (ii) the payment of dividends to an indirect parent company to fund debt service obligations, and (iii) principal repayments.\nCash used in financing activities was $12.0 million in fiscal 2013 resulting primarily from the repayment of debt.\nFinancing Arrangements\nABL Facility\nWe have an ABL Facility, which is governed by a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the other agents and lenders, which provides for a $350 million senior secured asset-based revolving line of credit (which may be increased by up to $25 million in certain circumstances), subject to a borrowing base limitation. On December 17, 2015, we amended the ABL Facility to increase the revolving credit commitments from $300 million to $350 million. The borrowing base under the ABL Facility equals the sum of : 90% of the eligible credit card receivables; plus, 85% of eligible accounts; plus, 90% (or 92.5% for the period of August 1 through December 31 of any fiscal year) of the net recovery percentage of eligible inventory multiplied by the cost of eligible inventory; plus, 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible letters of credit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible letter of credit inventory; plus, 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible in-transit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible in-transit inventory; plus, 100% of qualified cash; minus, all availability and inventory reserves. The ABL Facility includes borrowing capacity in the forms of letters of credit up to $300 million, and up to $25 million in U.S. dollars for loans on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, and is available in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. Any amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are due and payable in full on the maturity date of December 10, 2019.\nOn January 30, 2016, standby letters of credit were $18.7 million, excess availability, as defined, was $331.3 million, and there were no borrowings outstanding. Average short-term borrowings under the ABL Facility were $17.5 million and $1.7 million in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\nSee note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the terms of the ABL Facility.\nDemand Letter of Credit Facilities\nWe have unsecured, demand letter of credit facilities with HSBC and Bank of America which provide for the issuance of up to $50 million and $20 million, respectively, of documentary letters of credit on a no fee basis. On January 30, 2016, outstanding documentary letters of credit were $12.4 million and aggregate availability under these facilities was $57.6 million.\nTerm Loan\nOn March 5, 2014, we refinanced our Term Loan Facility, the proceeds of which were used to (i) refinance amounts outstanding under the former term loan facility of $1,167 million and (ii) together with cash on hand, redeem in full the outstanding Senior Notes of $400 million, and to pay fees, call premiums and accrued interest to the date of redemption, pursuant to the indenture governing the Senior Notes. The maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is March 5, 2021.\nWe are required to make principal repayments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility, or $3.9 million, on the last business day of January, April, July, and October, which commenced in July 2014. We are also required to repay the term loan based on annual excess cash flow, as defined in the agreement beginning in fiscal 2014.\nThe interest rate on the $1,540 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility was 4.00% on January 30, 2016.\nSee note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the terms of the Term Loan Facility.\nPIK Notes\nOn November 4, 2013, Chinos Intermediate Holdings A, Inc. (the Issuer\u201d), an indirect parent holding company of Group, issued $500 million aggregate principal of 7.75/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due May 1, 2019 (the PIK Notes\u201d). The PIK Notes are (i) senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the Issuer's subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in our financial statements. In fiscal 2015, we paid dividends of $38 million in the aggregate to the Issuer to fund the semi-annual interest payments due May 1, 2015 and November 1, 2015.\nOn October 30, 2015, the Issuer delivered notice to U.S. Bank N.A., as trustee, under the indenture governing the PIK Notes, that with respect to the interest that will be due on such notes on the May 2, 2016 interest payment date, the Issuer will make such interest payment by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. The PIK election will increase the outstanding principal balance of the PIK Notes by $21.3 million to $521.3 million. Therefore, we will not pay a dividend to the Issuer in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the PIK Notes, the Issuer intends to evaluate this option prior to the beginning of each interest period based on relevant factors at that time.\nOutlook\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from (i) capital expenditures, (ii) debt service requirements, including required (a) quarterly principal repayments, (b) repayments, if any, based on annual excess cash flows, if any, as defined and (c) dividends to the Issuer, when required, for the purposes of servicing debt, and (iii) working capital. Management anticipates that capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 will be approximately $95 to $105 million, including $40 to $45 million for new stores, $35 to $40 million for information technology enhancements, $10 to $15 million for warehouse and corporate office improvements, and the remainder for store renovations and general corporate purposes. Management expects to pay interest of approximately $73 million in fiscal 2016, excluding any payments of dividends to the Issuer to fund debt service obligations. Management believes that our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, projected cash flow from operations and amounts available under the ABL Facility will be adequate to fund our primary short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Our ability to satisfy these obligations and to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our financing arrangements, depends on our future operating performance, which in turn, may be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in part II of this report.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase, directly or indirectly, our outstanding indebtedness, including the PIK Notes, through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such purchases and/or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, which could impact our capital structure, the market for our debt securities, the price of the indebtedness being purchased and/or exchanged and affect our liquidity.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate a portion of our international purchase of merchandise. We also enter into standby letters of credit to secure reimbursement obligations under certain insurance and import programs and lease obligations. As of January 30, 2016, we had the following obligations under letters of credit in future periods.\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> Letters of Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Within\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Documentary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 30, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Within\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,123.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 183.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 336.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 261.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 341.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 622.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 622.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employment agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 625.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 625.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Credit Facilities(3)(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,539.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1, 461.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends to Parent(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,287.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 824.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 368.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 293.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,802.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Operating lease obligations represent obligations under various long-term operating leases entered in the normal course of business for retail and factory stores, warehouses, office space and equipment requiring minimum annual rentals. Operating lease expense is a significant component of our operating expenses. The lease terms range for various periods of time in various rental markets and are entered into at different times, which mitigates exposure to market changes that could have a material effect on our results of operations within any given year. Operating lease obligations do not include common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and other occupancy costs, which aggregate to approximately 45% of the minimum lease obligations. \n (2) As of January 30, 2016, we have recorded $21.1 million in liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, which are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. While these tax liabilities may result in future cash outflows, management cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the effective settlement of these positions. \n (3) Our Senior Credit Facilities are comprised of a $1,540 million Term Loan Facility and a $350 million ABL Facility. The amount reflected does not take into account any amounts that may be required to be prepaid from time to time based on our excess cash flow. \n (4) Amounts shown do not include interest. \n (5) On November 4, 2013, the Issuer, an indirect parent holding company of Group, issued $500 million aggregate principal of 7.75/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due May 1, 2019. The PIK Notes are: (i) senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Issuers' subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the Issuers' subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in our financial statements. In fiscal 2015, we paid dividends of $38 million in the aggregate to the Issuer to fund the semi-annual interest payments due May 1, 2015 and November 1, 2015. On October 30, 2015, the Issuer delivered notice to U.S. Bank N.A., as trustee, under the indenture governing the PIK Notes, that with respect to the interest that will be due on such notes on the May 2, 2016 interest payment date, the Issuer will make such interest payment by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. The PIK election will increase the outstanding principal balance of the PIK Notes by $21.3 million to $521.3 million. Therefore, we will not pay a dividend to the Issuer in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the PIK Notes, the Issuer intends to evaluate this option prior to the beginning of each interest period based on relevant factors at that time. \nImpact of Inflation\nOur results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2015, a pronouncement was issued that requires entities to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We adopted this pronouncement on January 30, 2016. The adoption of this guidance required changes in presentation only and therefore did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption resulted in the reclassification of $19,280 from current assets to long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2015.\nIn May 2014, a pronouncement was issued that clarified the principles of revenue recognition, which standardizes a comprehensive model for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, a pronouncement was issued that requires certain debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction of the carrying amount of that debt liability. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, a pronouncement was issued that more closely aligns the measurement of inventory in U.S. GAAP with International Financial Reporting Standards by requiring companies using the first-in, first-out and average costs methods to measure inventory using the lower of cost and net realizable value. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, a pronouncement was issued that requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with accounting lease terms of more than 12 months. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. While we are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements, the adoption is expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent consolidated results of operations. For more information on our accounting policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\n \u00b7 We recognize sales made in our stores at the point of sale, and sales through our e-commerce business at an estimated date of receipt by the customer. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling sales are classified as other revenues. We make estimates of future sales returns related to current period sales. Management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns. \n \u00b7 Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. \n \u00b7 We account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold and recognizing revenue at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. We review our gift card liability on an ongoing basis and recognize income from unredeemed gift card liability on a ratable basis over the estimated period of redemption. We defer revenue and recognize a liability for gift cards issued in connection with our customer loyalty program. Any unredeemed loyalty gift cards are recognized as income in the period in which they expire. \nInventory Valuation\nMerchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value. We capitalize certain design, purchasing and warehousing costs in inventory. We evaluate all of our inventories to determine excess inventories based on estimated future sales. Excess inventories may be disposed of through our e-commerce business, factory stores and other liquidation methods. Based on historical results experienced through various methods of disposition, we write down the carrying value of inventories that are not expected to be sold at or above cost. Additionally, we reduce the cost of inventories based on an estimate of lost or stolen items each period.\nDeferred Catalog Costs\nThe costs associated with direct response advertising, which consist primarily of catalog production and mailing costs, are capitalized and amortized over the expected future revenue stream of the catalog mailings, which we currently estimate to be two months. The expected future revenue stream is determined based on historical revenue trends developed over an extended period of time. If the current revenue streams were to diverge from the expected trend, our amortization of deferred catalog costs would be adjusted accordingly.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the J.Crew trade name and goodwill, are not subject to amortization. The Company assesses the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangibles whenever there are indicators of impairment, or at least annually in the fourth quarter. If the recorded carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company records a charge to write the intangible asset down to its fair value. Definite-lived intangibles, such as the Madewell trade name, loyalty program, customer lists and favorable lease commitments, are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful life or remaining lease term.\nWe assess the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, which consists of our operating segments, J.Crew and Madewell. In this assessment, we first compare the estimated enterprise fair value of each of our reporting units to its recorded carrying value. We estimate the enterprise fair value based on a combination of an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow, a market approach, and a transaction approach. If the recorded carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated enterprise fair value in the first step, a second step is performed in which we allocate the enterprise fair value to the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets. The second step of the impairment testing process requires, among other things, estimates of fair values of substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. Any enterprise fair value in excess of amounts allocated to such net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill for that reporting unit. If the recorded goodwill balance for a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write goodwill down to its fair value.\nIn fiscal 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of (i) $1,017 million related to goodwill and (ii) $360 million related to the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name. The remaining goodwill of $108 million on our balance sheet at January 30, 2016 relates entirely to the Madewell reporting unit. There is no remaining goodwill attributable to the J.Crew reporting unit. The carrying value of the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name is $380.0 million at January 30, 2016. If operating results continue to decline below the Company's expectations, additional impairment charges may be recorded in the future.\nFixed Asset Impairment\nWe are exposed to potential impairment if the book value of our assets exceeds their expected undiscounted future cash flows. The major components of our long-lived assets are store fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements. We test for impairment at the store level and the net book value is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected discounted future net cash flows is less than net book value.\nIn fiscal 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $4,522 related to certain long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes\nAn asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred taxes are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred taxes are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance.\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the net deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, a valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined unrealizable, any valuation allowance would be reversed into income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of current and deferred taxes involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectation could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWith respect to uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return, we recognize in our financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not\u201d threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement.\nIt is our intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings and profits from our foreign operations that have been generated through January 30, 2016. Future plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the foreign amounts to fund U.S. operations. Cumulative undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries were $46.4 million at January 30, 2016. No deferred federal income taxes were provided for the undistributed earnings as they are permanently reinvested in our international operations. Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is $22.7 million, valued in U.S. dollars, at January 30, 2016.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of employee share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense in the statement of operations. Determining the fair value of options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility and the expected dividend yield. Upon grant of awards, we also estimate an amount of forfeitures that will occur prior to vesting. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from the estimates, share-based compensation expense could be materially impacted.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe financial statements of the Company's foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, equity accounts at historical exchange rates, while revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income, but are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness. As cash flow hedges, unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. The interest rate swap agreements are highly correlated to the changes in interest rates to which the Company is exposed. Unrealized gains and losses on this instrument are designated as effective or ineffective. The effective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, while the ineffective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of interest expense. Future realized gains and losses in connection with each required interest payment are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss to interest expense.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during each of the years in a three-year period ended January 30, 2016. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on January 30, 2016, January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, respectively. Each fiscal year consisted of 52 weeks. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nExecutive Overview\nJ.Crew is an internationally recognized multi-brand apparel and accessories retailer that differentiates itself through high standards of quality, style, design and fabrics. We are a vertically-integrated, omni-channel specialty retailer that operates stores and websites both domestically and internationally. We design, market and sell our products, including those under the J.Crew\u00ae and Madewell\u00ae brands, offering complete assortments of women's, men's and children's apparel and accessories.\nA summary of our revenues by brand is as follows:\n\n (a) Consists primarily of shipping and handling fees and revenues from third-party resellers. \nAs of January 30, 2016, we operated 287 J.Crew retail stores, 161 J.Crew factory stores (including 10 J.Crew Mercantile stores), and 103 Madewell stores throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and France; compared to 280 J.Crew retail stores, 139 J.Crew factory stores, and 85 Madewell stores as of January 31, 2015.\nA summary of highlights for fiscal 2015 is as follows:\n \u00b7 Revenues decreased 2.9% to $2,505.8 million, with comparable company sales down 8.2%. \n \u00b7 J.Crew revenues decreased 6.5% to $2,146.7 million, with comparable J.Crew sales down 9.9%. \n \u00b7 Madewell revenues increased 22.7% to $301.0 million, with comparable Madewell sales up 7.8%. \n \u00b7 We recorded non-cash impairment losses of $1,382 million, a result of write downs of (i) goodwill of $1,017 million, (ii) intangible assets of $360 million, and (iii) certain long-lived assets of $5 million. \n \u00b7 We opened 11 J.Crew retail stores, 22 J.Crew factory stores (including 10 J.Crew Mercantile stores), and 18 Madewell stores. We closed four J.Crew retail stores. \n \u00b7 We initiated a workforce reduction as part of a cost reduction program. We incurred a pre-tax charge of $4.8 million for severance and related costs, which will result in annualized pre-tax savings of payroll and related costs of approximately $17 million. \nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. A key measure used in evaluating our business is comparable company sales. We also consider gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses in assessing the performance of our business.\nNet Sales\nNet sales reflect our revenues from the sale of our merchandise less returns and discounts. We aggregate our merchandise into four sales categories: (i) women's apparel, (ii) men's apparel, (iii) children's apparel, and (iv) accessories, which include shoes, socks, jewelry, handbags, belts and hair accessories. The approximate percentage of our sales by these four categories is as follows:\n\nComparable Company Sales\nComparable company sales reflect: (i) net sales at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, (ii) e-commerce net sales, and (iii) shipping and handling fees, which are recorded as other revenues on our statements of operations. Comparable company sales exclude net sales from: (i) new stores that have not been open for 12 months, (ii) the 53rd week, if applicable, (iii) stores that experience a square footage change of at least 15 percent, (iv) stores that have been temporarily closed for at least 30 consecutive days, (v) permanently closed stores, (vi) temporary pop up\u201d stores and (vii) revenue from third party resellers.\nMeasuring the change in year-over-year comparable company sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our business. Various factors affect comparable company sales, including:\n \u00b7 consumer preferences, fashion trends, buying trends and overall economic trends, \n \u00b7 competition, \n \u00b7 changes in our merchandise mix, \n \u00b7 pricing, \n \u00b7 the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events, \n \u00b7 the level of customer service that we provide, \n \u00b7 our ability to source and distribute products efficiently, and \n \u00b7 the number of stores we open, close (including on a temporary basis for renovations) and expand in any period. \nCyclicality and Seasonality\nOur industry is cyclical and our revenues are affected by general economic conditions. Purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and consumer confidence.\nOur business is seasonal and as a result, our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have four distinct selling seasons that align with our four fiscal quarters. Revenues are usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter, particularly in December when customers make holiday purchases. In fiscal 2015, we realized approximately 28% of our revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is determined by subtracting our cost of goods sold from our revenues. Cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, freight, design, buying and production costs, occupancy costs related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and all shipping costs associated with our e-commerce business. Cost of goods sold varies directly with revenues, and therefore, is usually higher in our fourth fiscal quarter. Cost of goods sold also changes as we expand or contract our store base and incur higher or lower store occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our revenues.\nOur gross profit may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold while others, like us, exclude all or a portion of them from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include all operating expenses not included in cost of goods sold, primarily catalog production and mailing costs, certain warehousing expenses, administrative payroll, store expenses other than occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, and credit card fees. These expenses do not necessarily vary proportionally with net sales.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our operating results as a percentage of revenues as well as selected store data:\n\n (1) We exclude a portion of our distribution network costs from cost of goods sold and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses. Our gross profit therefore may not be directly comparable to that of some of our competitors. \nResults of Operations-Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\n\nRevenues\nTotal revenues decreased $73.9 million, or 2.9%, to $2,505.8 million from $2,579.7 million last year, driven primarily by a decrease in sales of J.Crew women's apparel, specifically knits, sweaters, and shorts. Comparable company sales decreased 8.2% following a decrease of 0.7% last year.\nJ.Crew sales decreased $148.4 million, or 6.5%, to $2,146.7 million from $2,295.1 million last year. J.Crew comparable sales decreased 9.9% following a decrease of 1.9% last year. In fiscal 2015, we saw a continuing softening of the sales trend in our J.Crew women's apparel.\nMadewell sales increased $55.7 million, or 22.7%, to $301.0 million from $245.3 million last year. Madewell comparable sales increased 7.8% following an increase of 14.1% last year.\nOther revenues increased $18.8 million, or 48.1%, to $58.1 million in fiscal 2015 from $39.3 million last year, primarily a result of revenue from third party resellers.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased $75.3 million to $895.6 million in fiscal 2015 from $970.9 million last year. This decrease resulted from the following factors:\n\nGross margin decreased to 35.7% in fiscal 2015 from 37.6% last year. The decrease in gross margin was driven by: (i) a 110 basis point deterioration in merchandise margin due to increased markdowns and (ii) an 80 basis point increase in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues, primarily driven by 47 net new stores.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $11.9 million, or 1.4%, to $834.1 million in fiscal 2015 from $846.0 million last year. This decrease primarily resulted from the following:\n\nAs a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 33.3% in fiscal 2015 from 32.8% last year.\nImpairment Losses\nDuring fiscal 2015, we experienced a reduction in the profitability of our J.Crew reporting unit. As a result of current and expected future operating results, we concluded that the carrying value of the J.Crew reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Therefore, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of (i) $1,017 million related to goodwill and (ii) $360 million related to the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name.\nAfter recording the impairment charges, the carrying value of goodwill is $108 million, which entirely relates to the Madewell reporting unit. There is no remaining goodwill attributable to the J.Crew reporting unit. The carrying value of the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name is $380.0 million at January 30, 2016. If operating results continue to decline below our expectations, additional impairment charges may be recorded in the future.\nA summary of the aggregate impairment losses is as follows:\n\nThese impairment charges do not have an effect on our operations, liquidity or financial covenants, and do not change management's long-term strategy, which includes its plans to drive disciplined growth across our brands.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased $4.6 million to $69.8 million in fiscal 2015 from $74.4 million last year driven primarily by the redemption of our 8.125% senior notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes\u201d), which occurred in the first quarter of last year. A summary of interest expense is as follows:\n\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate was 11% and 8% for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate in each fiscal year was driven primarily by the non-cash impairment charges related to the write off of goodwill, which is not tax deductible, and therefore has no tax benefit. Other items impacting the effective rates include state and local income taxes, benefits of lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, offset by the recognition of certain foreign valuation allowances.\nNet Loss\nNet loss increased $584.9 million to $1,242.7 million in fiscal 2015 from $657.8 million last year. This increase was due to: (i) an increase in impairment losses of $671.6 million, (ii) a decrease in gross profit of $75.3 million, offset by (iii) an increase in the benefit for income taxes of $86.7 million, (iv) a loss on refinancing in the prior year of $59.0 million, (v) a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $11.9 million and (vi) a decrease in interest expense of $4.6 million.\nResults of Operations-Fiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013\n\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased $151.4 million, or 6.2%, to $2,579.7 million in fiscal 2014 from $2,428.3 million in fiscal 2013, driven primarily by an increase in sales of (i) men's apparel, specifically shirts, suiting, and knits and (ii) women's apparel, specifically knits, jackets, and pants. Comparable company sales decreased 0.7% in fiscal 2014 following an increase of 3.1% in fiscal 2013.\nJ.Crew sales increased $82.4 million, or 3.7%, to $2,295.1 million in fiscal 2014 from $2,212.7 million in fiscal 2013. J.Crew comparable sales decreased 1.9% following an increase of 2.7% last year.\nMadewell sales increased $63.9 million, or 35.2%, to $245.3 million in fiscal 2014 from $181.4 million in fiscal 2013. Madewell comparable sales increased 14.1% in fiscal 2014 following an increase of 9.1% in fiscal 2013.\nOther revenues, which consisted primarily of shipping and handling fees, increased $5.1 million, or 14.8%, to $39.3 million in fiscal 2014 from $34.2 million in fiscal 2013.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased $35.2 million to $970.9 million in fiscal 2014 from $1,006.1 million in fiscal 2013. This decrease resulted from the following factors:\n\nGross margin decreased to 37.6% in fiscal 2014 from 41.4% in fiscal 2013. The decrease in gross margin was driven by: (i) a 330 basis point deterioration in merchandise margin due to increased markdowns and (ii) a 50 basis point increase in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $91.7 million, or 12.1%, to $846.0 million in fiscal 2014 from $754.3 million in fiscal 2013. This increase primarily resulted from the following:\n\nAs a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 32.8% in fiscal 2014 from 31.1% in fiscal 2013.\nImpairment Losses\nThe impairment losses recorded in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were the result of the write-down of the following assets:\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we changed our operating segments and reporting units to align with our omni-channel strategy, which focuses on providing a seamless approach to the customer experience through all available sales channels. Prior to such change, as a multi-channel retailer, we allocated resources to our channels, Stores and Direct. As an omni-channel retailer, we allocate resources to our brands. Accordingly, we changed our operating segments to J.Crew and Madewell, which have been aggregated into one reportable segment. At the end of fiscal 2014, the goodwill allocated to the J.Crew and Madewell reporting units was $1,017 million and $108 million, respectively.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased $29.8 million to $74.4 million in fiscal 2014 from $104.2 million in fiscal 2013 driven primarily by the redemption of our Senior Notes. A summary of interest expense is as follows:\n\nLoss on Refinancings\nIn fiscal 2014, we refinanced our Term Loan Facility and ABL Facility and redeemed our Senior Notes. In connection with these refinancings, we recorded a loss of $59.0 million, the components of which are as follows:\n\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 8.4%. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate was driven primarily by the non-cash impairment charge related to the write off of goodwill, which is not tax deductible, and therefore has no tax benefit. Other items impacting the effective rate include state and local income taxes, benefits of lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, offset by the recognition of certain foreign valuation allowances.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 39.4%. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate was driven primarily by state and local income taxes, offset by certain federal tax credits.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income (loss) decreased $745.9 million to a net loss of $657.8 million in fiscal 2014 from net income of $88.1 million in fiscal 2013. This decrease was due to: (i) impairment losses of $708.1 million, (ii) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $91.7 million, (iii) the loss on refinancings of $59.0 million, and (iv) a decrease in gross profit of $35.2 million, partially offset by (v) a decrease in the provision for income taxes of $118.2 million and (vi) a decrease in interest expense of $29.8 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under the ABL Facility. Our primary cash needs are (i) capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores and remodeling our existing stores, investments in our distribution network, making information technology system enhancements, (ii) meeting debt service requirements (including paying dividends to an indirect parent company, when required, for the purposes of servicing debt - see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements) and (iii) funding working capital requirements. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts payable and other current liabilities. See -Outlook\u201d below.\nOperating Activities\n\nCash provided by operating activities of $135.6 million in fiscal 2015 resulted from: (i) non-cash adjustments of $1,359.7 million and (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities of $18.6 million due to seasonal working capital fluctuations, offset by (ii) net loss of $1,242.7 million.\nCash provided by operating activities of $158.1 million in fiscal 2014 resulted from: (i) non-cash adjustments, including impairment losses and the loss on refinancings of $820.6 million, offset by (ii) net loss of $657.8 million and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.7 million due primarily to seasonal working capital fluctuations, primarily increased merchandise inventories and reduced accrued interest as a result of the redemption of our Senior Notes in March 2014.\nCash provided by operating activities of $232.5 million in fiscal 2013 resulted from: (i) net income of $88.1 million, (ii) adjustments to net income of $119.5 million, and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities of $24.9 million due primarily to an increase in accounts payable, as a result of working capital management, offset by an increase in merchandise inventories.\nInvesting Activities\n\n (1) Includes capital expenditures for warehouse and corporate office expansion, store renovations and general corporate purposes. \nCapital expenditures are planned at approximately $95 to $105 million for fiscal 2016, including $40 to $45 million for new stores, $35 to $40 million for information technology enhancements, $10 to $15 million for warehouse and corporate office expansion, and the remainder for store renovations and general corporate purposes.\nFinancing Activities\n\nCash used in financing activities was $54.0 million in fiscal 2015 resulting from (i) the payment of dividends to an indirect parent company to fund debt service obligations and (ii) principal repayments of the Term Loan Facility.\nCash used in financing activities was $69.5 million in fiscal 2014 resulting from (i) costs paid in connection with the refinancings of debt, (ii) the payment of dividends to an indirect parent company to fund debt service obligations, and (iii) principal repayments.\nCash used in financing activities was $12.0 million in fiscal 2013 resulting primarily from the repayment of debt.\nFinancing Arrangements\nABL Facility\nWe have an ABL Facility, which is governed by a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the other agents and lenders, which provides for a $350 million senior secured asset-based revolving line of credit (which may be increased by up to $25 million in certain circumstances), subject to a borrowing base limitation. On December 17, 2015, we amended the ABL Facility to increase the revolving credit commitments from $300 million to $350 million. The borrowing base under the ABL Facility equals the sum of : 90% of the eligible credit card receivables; plus, 85% of eligible accounts; plus, 90% (or 92.5% for the period of August 1 through December 31 of any fiscal year) of the net recovery percentage of eligible inventory multiplied by the cost of eligible inventory; plus, 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible letters of credit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible letter of credit inventory; plus, 85% of the net recovery percentage of eligible in-transit inventory, multiplied by the cost of eligible in-transit inventory; plus, 100% of qualified cash; minus, all availability and inventory reserves. The ABL Facility includes borrowing capacity in the forms of letters of credit up to $300 million, and up to $25 million in U.S. dollars for loans on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, and is available in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. Any amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are due and payable in full on the maturity date of December 10, 2019.\nOn January 30, 2016, standby letters of credit were $18.7 million, excess availability, as defined, was $331.3 million, and there were no borrowings outstanding. Average short-term borrowings under the ABL Facility were $17.5 million and $1.7 million in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.\nSee note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the terms of the ABL Facility.\nDemand Letter of Credit Facilities\nWe have unsecured, demand letter of credit facilities with HSBC and Bank of America which provide for the issuance of up to $50 million and $20 million, respectively, of documentary letters of credit on a no fee basis. On January 30, 2016, outstanding documentary letters of credit were $12.4 million and aggregate availability under these facilities was $57.6 million.\nTerm Loan\nOn March 5, 2014, we refinanced our Term Loan Facility, the proceeds of which were used to (i) refinance amounts outstanding under the former term loan facility of $1,167 million and (ii) together with cash on hand, redeem in full the outstanding Senior Notes of $400 million, and to pay fees, call premiums and accrued interest to the date of redemption, pursuant to the indenture governing the Senior Notes. The maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is March 5, 2021.\nWe are required to make principal repayments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility, or $3.9 million, on the last business day of January, April, July, and October, which commenced in July 2014. We are also required to repay the term loan based on annual excess cash flow, as defined in the agreement beginning in fiscal 2014.\nThe interest rate on the $1,540 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility was 4.00% on January 30, 2016.\nSee note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the terms of the Term Loan Facility.\nPIK Notes\nOn November 4, 2013, Chinos Intermediate Holdings A, Inc. (the Issuer\u201d), an indirect parent holding company of Group, issued $500 million aggregate principal of 7.75/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due May 1, 2019 (the PIK Notes\u201d). The PIK Notes are (i) senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the Issuer's subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in our financial statements. In fiscal 2015, we paid dividends of $38 million in the aggregate to the Issuer to fund the semi-annual interest payments due May 1, 2015 and November 1, 2015.\nOn October 30, 2015, the Issuer delivered notice to U.S. Bank N.A., as trustee, under the indenture governing the PIK Notes, that with respect to the interest that will be due on such notes on the May 2, 2016 interest payment date, the Issuer will make such interest payment by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. The PIK election will increase the outstanding principal balance of the PIK Notes by $21.3 million to $521.3 million. Therefore, we will not pay a dividend to the Issuer in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the PIK Notes, the Issuer intends to evaluate this option prior to the beginning of each interest period based on relevant factors at that time.\nOutlook\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from (i) capital expenditures, (ii) debt service requirements, including required (a) quarterly principal repayments, (b) repayments, if any, based on annual excess cash flows, if any, as defined and (c) dividends to the Issuer, when required, for the purposes of servicing debt, and (iii) working capital. Management anticipates that capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 will be approximately $95 to $105 million, including $40 to $45 million for new stores, $35 to $40 million for information technology enhancements, $10 to $15 million for warehouse and corporate office improvements, and the remainder for store renovations and general corporate purposes. Management expects to pay interest of approximately $73 million in fiscal 2016, excluding any payments of dividends to the Issuer to fund debt service obligations. Management believes that our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, projected cash flow from operations and amounts available under the ABL Facility will be adequate to fund our primary short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Our ability to satisfy these obligations and to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our financing arrangements, depends on our future operating performance, which in turn, may be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in part II of this report.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase, directly or indirectly, our outstanding indebtedness, including the PIK Notes, through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such purchases and/or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, which could impact our capital structure, the market for our debt securities, the price of the indebtedness being purchased and/or exchanged and affect our liquidity.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate a portion of our international purchase of merchandise. We also enter into standby letters of credit to secure reimbursement obligations under certain insurance and import programs and lease obligations. As of January 30, 2016, we had the following obligations under letters of credit in future periods.\n\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 30, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\n (1) Operating lease obligations represent obligations under various long-term operating leases entered in the normal course of business for retail and factory stores, warehouses, office space and equipment requiring minimum annual rentals. Operating lease expense is a significant component of our operating expenses. The lease terms range for various periods of time in various rental markets and are entered into at different times, which mitigates exposure to market changes that could have a material effect on our results of operations within any given year. Operating lease obligations do not include common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and other occupancy costs, which aggregate to approximately 45% of the minimum lease obligations. \n (2) As of January 30, 2016, we have recorded $21.1 million in liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, which are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. While these tax liabilities may result in future cash outflows, management cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the effective settlement of these positions. \n (3) Our Senior Credit Facilities are comprised of a $1,540 million Term Loan Facility and a $350 million ABL Facility. The amount reflected does not take into account any amounts that may be required to be prepaid from time to time based on our excess cash flow. \n (4) Amounts shown do not include interest. \n (5) On November 4, 2013, the Issuer, an indirect parent holding company of Group, issued $500 million aggregate principal of 7.75/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due May 1, 2019. The PIK Notes are: (i) senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, (ii) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of the Issuers' subsidiaries, and (iii) not guaranteed by any of the Issuers' subsidiaries, and therefore are not recorded in our financial statements. In fiscal 2015, we paid dividends of $38 million in the aggregate to the Issuer to fund the semi-annual interest payments due May 1, 2015 and November 1, 2015. On October 30, 2015, the Issuer delivered notice to U.S. Bank N.A., as trustee, under the indenture governing the PIK Notes, that with respect to the interest that will be due on such notes on the May 2, 2016 interest payment date, the Issuer will make such interest payment by paying in kind at the PIK interest rate of 8.50% instead of paying in cash. The PIK election will increase the outstanding principal balance of the PIK Notes by $21.3 million to $521.3 million. Therefore, we will not pay a dividend to the Issuer in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the PIK Notes, the Issuer intends to evaluate this option prior to the beginning of each interest period based on relevant factors at that time. \nImpact of Inflation\nOur results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2015, a pronouncement was issued that requires entities to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We adopted this pronouncement on January 30, 2016. The adoption of this guidance required changes in presentation only and therefore did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption resulted in the reclassification of $19,280 from current assets to long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2015.\nIn May 2014, a pronouncement was issued that clarified the principles of revenue recognition, which standardizes a comprehensive model for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, a pronouncement was issued that requires certain debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction of the carrying amount of that debt liability. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, a pronouncement was issued that more closely aligns the measurement of inventory in U.S. GAAP with International Financial Reporting Standards by requiring companies using the first-in, first-out and average costs methods to measure inventory using the lower of cost and net realizable value. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, a pronouncement was issued that requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with accounting lease terms of more than 12 months. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. While we are currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements, the adoption is expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent consolidated results of operations. For more information on our accounting policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\n \u00b7 We recognize sales made in our stores at the point of sale, and sales through our e-commerce business at an estimated date of receipt by the customer. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling sales are classified as other revenues. We make estimates of future sales returns related to current period sales. Management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns. \n \u00b7 Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. \n \u00b7 We account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold and recognizing revenue at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. We review our gift card liability on an ongoing basis and recognize income from unredeemed gift card liability on a ratable basis over the estimated period of redemption. We defer revenue and recognize a liability for gift cards issued in connection with our customer loyalty program. Any unredeemed loyalty gift cards are recognized as income in the period in which they expire. \nInventory Valuation\nMerchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value. We capitalize certain design, purchasing and warehousing costs in inventory. We evaluate all of our inventories to determine excess inventories based on estimated future sales. Excess inventories may be disposed of through our e-commerce business, factory stores and other liquidation methods. Based on historical results experienced through various methods of disposition, we write down the carrying value of inventories that are not expected to be sold at or above cost. Additionally, we reduce the cost of inventories based on an estimate of lost or stolen items each period.\nDeferred Catalog Costs\nThe costs associated with direct response advertising, which consist primarily of catalog production and mailing costs, are capitalized and amortized over the expected future revenue stream of the catalog mailings, which we currently estimate to be two months. The expected future revenue stream is determined based on historical revenue trends developed over an extended period of time. If the current revenue streams were to diverge from the expected trend, our amortization of deferred catalog costs would be adjusted accordingly.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the J.Crew trade name and goodwill, are not subject to amortization. The Company assesses the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangibles whenever there are indicators of impairment, or at least annually in the fourth quarter. If the recorded carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company records a charge to write the intangible asset down to its fair value. Definite-lived intangibles, such as the Madewell trade name, loyalty program, customer lists and favorable lease commitments, are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful life or remaining lease term.\nWe assess the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, which consists of our operating segments, J.Crew and Madewell. In this assessment, we first compare the estimated enterprise fair value of each of our reporting units to its recorded carrying value. We estimate the enterprise fair value based on a combination of an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow, a market approach, and a transaction approach. If the recorded carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated enterprise fair value in the first step, a second step is performed in which we allocate the enterprise fair value to the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets. The second step of the impairment testing process requires, among other things, estimates of fair values of substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. Any enterprise fair value in excess of amounts allocated to such net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill for that reporting unit. If the recorded goodwill balance for a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write goodwill down to its fair value.\nIn fiscal 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of (i) $1,017 million related to goodwill and (ii) $360 million related to the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name. The remaining goodwill of $108 million on our balance sheet at January 30, 2016 relates entirely to the Madewell reporting unit. There is no remaining goodwill attributable to the J.Crew reporting unit. The carrying value of the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name is $380.0 million at January 30, 2016. If operating results continue to decline below the Company's expectations, additional impairment charges may be recorded in the future.\nFixed Asset Impairment\nWe are exposed to potential impairment if the book value of our assets exceeds their expected undiscounted future cash flows. The major components of our long-lived assets are store fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements. We test for impairment at the store level and the net book value is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected discounted future net cash flows is less than net book value.\nIn fiscal 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $4,522 related to certain long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes\nAn asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred taxes are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Inherent in the measurement of deferred taxes are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance.\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the net deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, a valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined unrealizable, any valuation allowance would be reversed into income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of current and deferred taxes involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectation could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWith respect to uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return, we recognize in our financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not\u201d threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement.\nIt is our intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings and profits from our foreign operations that have been generated through January 30, 2016. Future plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the foreign amounts to fund U.S. operations. Cumulative undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries were $46.4 million at January 30, 2016. No deferred federal income taxes were provided for the undistributed earnings as they are permanently reinvested in our international operations. Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is $22.7 million, valued in U.S. dollars, at January 30, 2016.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of employee share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense in the statement of operations. Determining the fair value of options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility and the expected dividend yield. Upon grant of awards, we also estimate an amount of forfeitures that will occur prior to vesting. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from the estimates, share-based compensation expense could be materially impacted.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe financial statements of the Company's foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, equity accounts at historical exchange rates, while revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income, but are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness. As cash flow hedges, unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. The interest rate swap agreements are highly correlated to the changes in interest rates to which the Company is exposed. Unrealized gains and losses on this instrument are designated as effective or ineffective. The effective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, while the ineffective portion of such gains or losses is recorded as a component of interest expense. Future realized gains and losses in connection with each required interest payment are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss to interest expense.\nTable 95: <table> <tr>
