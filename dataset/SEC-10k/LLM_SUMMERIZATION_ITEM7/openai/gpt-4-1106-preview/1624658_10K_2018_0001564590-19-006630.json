Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a late-stage, clinical biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutics to treat patients with rare and severe metabolic and kidney disorders. We are focused on metabolic disorders that result in excess accumulation of certain metabolites that can cause kidney stones, damage the kidney, and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease, or CKD, and end-stage renal disease. Our lead product candidate, reloxaliase (formerly known as ALLN-177), is a first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutic that we are developing for the treatment of hyperoxaluria, a metabolic disorder characterized by markedly elevated urinary oxalate levels and commonly associated with kidney stones, CKD and other serious kidney diseases. There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of hyperoxaluria.\nWe have conducted a robust clinical development program of reloxaliase, including three Phase 2 clinical trials, which demonstrated reductions of urinary oxalate excretion in patients with secondary hyperoxaluria, particularly in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Reloxaliase has also been well tolerated in clinical trials to date. Based on these data, the high unmet medical need, the enzyme's specific mechanism of action, and the significant market opportunity, we are initially developing reloxaliase for adult patients with enteric hyperoxaluria.\nIn March 2018, we initiated URIROX-1TM (URIROX-1) (formerly Study 301), the first of our two anticipated Phase 3 clinical trials in support of our planned Biologic License Application, or BLA, for reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Based on our enrollment progress to date, we expect to announce topline data from this trial in the second half of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated URIROX-2 (formerly Study 302), our second pivotal Phase 3 trial of reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. The FDA has advised us that it agrees with our strategy to pursue a BLA submission for reloxaliase using the accelerated approval regulatory pathway. We expect to submit a BLA filing to the FDA after 400 patients have been randomized and followed for six months in URIROX-2. For the long-term follow-up phase of the trial, subjects would continue in URIROX-2 for a minimum treatment period of two years to confirm clinical benefit post-approval.\nIn addition to our Phase 3 program of reloxaliase for enteric hyperoxaluria, we are also evaluating reloxaliase in Study 206, a Phase 2 basket trial in adults and adolescents with primary hyperoxaluria or enteric hyperoxaluria with hyperoxalemia, which we initiated in March 2018. We expect to announce interim data from Study 206 in the second quarter of 2019 and topline data from this trial in the second half of 2019.\nIn addition, we have designed our second product candidate, ALLN-346, an orally administered, novel, urate degrading enzyme, for patients with hyperuricemia and gout in the setting of advanced CKD. Hyperuricemia, or elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, results from overproduction or insufficient excretion of urate, or often a combination of the two. ALLN-346 has demonstrated a robust reduction in both plasma and urine uric acid levels in an established urate oxidase knock-out mouse model, a severe animal model of hyperuricemia with advanced CKD and kidney damage due to urate crystal deposition. We presented preclinical data for ALLN-346 in October at the 2018 American College of Rheumatology (ACR/ARHP) Annual Meeting. We are advancing our preclinical program for ALLN-346 and scaling our manufacturing processes for clinical studies. Subject to the successful completion of these activities, we expect to file an IND for ALLN-346 with the FDA in the second half of 2019 and to initiate our first clinical trial of ALLN-346 in patients with hyperuricemia in the first half of 2020.\nOn November 6, 2017, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 5,333,333 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $74.7 million. The underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option on December 1, 2017, and purchased 16,969 shares of our common stock, for aggregate gross\nproceeds of $0.2 million. As a result of the IPO, we received approximately $67.0 million in net proceeds after deducting $7.9 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nOur operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, producing drug substance and drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials, conducting preclinical studies of our product candidates and clinical trials for our lead product candidate, reloxaliase. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue to date. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $61.6 million.\nWe have incurred significant net operating losses in every year since our inception and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Our net losses were $35.6 million, $21.7 million and $24.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $117.6 million. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we:\nTable 311: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conduct future clinical trials of our lead product candidate, reloxaliase;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> manufacture additional material for our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program and potential future clinical studies we might conduct for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> scale up our manufacturing process for reloxaliase to prepare for the filing of a potential Biologics License Application, or BLA, and commercialization if our clinical development program is successful;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> advance the development of ALLN-346;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conduct research on the discovery and development of additional product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval in geographies in which we plan to commercialize our products ourselves;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 318: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 319: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> hire additional staff, including clinical, scientific, technical, operational, and financial personnel, to execute our business plan; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 320: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts, and to enable us to operate as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate. Additionally, we currently use contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to carry out our preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not yet have a sales organization. If we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, including strategic collaborations. We may, however, be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our current product candidates, or any additional product candidates, if developed.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales or any other source and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for reloxaliase or other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in marketing approval or collaboration or license\nagreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such collaboration or license agreements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 321: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 322: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs incurred under agreements with third parties, including CROs, that conduct research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 323: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs related to production of preclinical and clinical materials, including fees paid to CMOs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 324: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 325: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of purchasing laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment used in our research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 326: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 327: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facility costs and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, depreciation and other supplies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as clinical site activations, patient enrollment, or information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and may be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nThe following summarizes our most advanced current research and development programs:\nTable 328: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> reloxaliase is our lead product candidate which we are developing for the treatment of hyperoxaluria.

We began incurring external research and development costs for this program in 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs and other internal costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by program (in thousands):\nTable 330: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reloxaliase external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ALLN-346 external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Since inception, we have incurred $65.0 million of external research and development\ncosts for reloxaliase and $2.4 million of external research and development costs for ALLN-346. We expect that our research and development costs will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we initiate additional clinical trials of reloxaliase, scale our manufacturing processes and advance development of ALLN-346.\nThe successful development of reloxaliase, ALLN-346 and other potential future product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue and material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies, clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\nTable 331: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials for reloxaliase;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 332: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> successful data from our clinical program of reloxaliase that supports an acceptable benefit-risk profile of reloxaliase in the intended populations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> establishing an appropriate safety profile for ALLN-346 and any potential future product candidate with studies to enable the filing of an investigational new drug application;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 334: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> approval of INDs for ALLN-346 and any potential future product candidate to commence planned or future clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 335: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 336: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> timing and receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> making arrangements with CMOs for third-party commercial manufacturing of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> obtaining and maintaining patent and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> commercializing the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> acceptance of the product, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development, manufacture or commercialization enabling activities of any of our product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, attorneys and accountants, among other expenses.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net, primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, interest expense incurred on our credit facilities, amortized debt discount related to the fair value of the warrants issued in conjunction with the advances under our former credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB related debt issuance costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, primarily consists of gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions and non-cash changes in the fair value of warrants issued in connection with our former credit facility with SVB. The warrants converted upon the closing of our IPO and therefore became exercisable into common stock instead of convertible preferred stock. The warrants for the purchase of common stock met the criteria to be classified in stockholders' equity and the fair value of the warrant liability as of the IPO date was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit). As a result, we will no longer recognize any changes to the fair value of the warrants through other income (expense).\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing purchase orders and open contracts, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by CROs and CMOs in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe contract with CROs and CMOs to conduct clinical and manufacturing and other research and development services on our behalf. We base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with them. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our CROs or CMOs will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, for stock-based awards granted to employees and directors for their services on the board of directors. We account for stock-based awards to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, or ASC 505-50. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock\noptions as of their grant date. We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make subjective assumptions.\nPursuant to ASC 718, we measure stock-based awards granted to employees and members of the board of directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding stock-based compensation expense of those awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have historically granted stock options with exercise prices equivalent to the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant.\nPursuant to ASC 505-50, we measure stock-based awards granted to consultants at fair value as the awards vest and recognize the resulting value as expense during the period the related services are rendered, which is typically the vesting period. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we re-measure the unvested portion of these awards using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses the following inputs: the fair value of our common stock, the expected volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Due to the lack of a public market for our common stock prior to our IPO and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development, life science industry focus, length of trading history and similar vesting provisions. The historical volatility data is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected option term is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the vesting term (generally four years) of our stock options. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the plain-vanilla\u201d nature of our stock-based awards. The expected term is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole, as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior among our employee population. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term of the arrangement as the basis for the expected term assumption. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.\nThe fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following range of assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 342: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.3% - 3.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9% - 2.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3% - 1.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5 - 6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6 - 6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4 - 6.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81% - 89%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81% - 87%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77% - 84%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fair value of stock options granted to consultants was estimated on the date of grant and as the grants are remeasured over the vesting period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following range of assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 343: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9% - 2.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9 - 10.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89% - 96%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not grant any stock options to consultants during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. These assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our\njudgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different.\nIn the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017, we made an accounting policy election to recognize forfeitures as they occur upon adoption of guidance per ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASU 2016-09. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In reporting periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2017, we estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised the forfeiture rate in subsequent periods as necessary if actual forfeitures differed from estimates.\nThrough December 31, 2016, the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements was based on awards that were ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures were estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. The term forfeitures\u201d is distinct from cancellations\u201d or expirations\u201d and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.\nThe following table summarizes the classification of our stock-based compensation expense recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\nTable 344: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $4.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock option awards, which is expected to be recognized over weighted-average remaining vesting periods of approximately 2.8 years. In future periods, we expect stock-based compensation expense to increase, due in part to our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, potential increases in the value of our common stock and expected additional stock-based awards to continue to attract and retain our employees.\nDetermination of Fair Value of Common Stock\nAs a private company with no active public market for our common stock prior to the completion of our IPO, our board of directors historically determined the fair value of our common stock on each date of grant, with input from management. Our board of directors periodically determined the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. Once a public trading market for our common stock had been established in connection with the completion of our IPO, it is no longer be necessary for us to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for stock options, as the fair value of our common stock will be its trading price on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nWe performed contemporaneous valuations, with the assistance of a third-party specialist, as of November 6, 2014, February 15, 2016, December 31, 2016, April 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $1.17, $1.59, $4.01, $4.88 and $5.72 per share, respectively. In conducting the valuations, we considered all objective and subjective factors that we believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted, including our best estimate of our business condition, prospects and operating performance at each valuation date. Within the valuations performed, a range of factors, assumptions and methodologies were used. The significant factors included:\nTable 345: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the lack of an active public market for our common stock and convertible preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the prices at which we sold shares of our convertible preferred stock in arm's length transactions and the superior rights, preferences and privileges of the convertible preferred stock relative to our common stock, including the liquidation preferences of our preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our results of operations and financial condition, including cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the material risks related to our business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 349: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our stage of development and business strategy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 350: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the composition of, and changes to, our management team and board of directors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 351: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the market performance of publicly traded companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors, as well as recently completed initial public offerings, or IPOs, of companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 352: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an IPO given prevailing market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHistorically, the dates of our contemporaneous valuations have not coincided with the dates of our stock-based compensation grants. In determining the exercise prices of the stock options granted, our board of directors considered, among other things, the most recent contemporaneous valuations of our common stock and our assessment of additional objective and subjective factors we believed were relevant as of the grant date. The additional factors considered when determining any changes in fair value of our common stock between the most recent contemporaneous valuation and the grant dates included the status of our stage of research and development, our operating and financial performance and current business conditions.\nThere were significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of our common stock. These judgments and estimates were management's best estimates and included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to completing an IPO or other liquidity event, the related company valuations associated with such events and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per common share could have been different.\nWarrant Valuation\nWe issued warrants to purchase shares of our Series A and Series C convertible preferred stock in conjunction with the advances made under our former credit facility with SVB. These warrants were classified as liabilities as they either conditionally or unconditionally obligated us to transfer assets regardless of the timing of the redemption feature or price of the underlying convertible preferred stock. The warrants were initially recorded at their grant date fair value and were subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of the warrants were recorded as a component of other income (expense) in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, until the earlier of their exercise or expiration or the completion of a liquidation event, at which time the warrant liability may be reclassified to stockholders' (deficit) equity if the criteria for recording the warrant as an equity instrument were met.\nThe fair value of the warrants was estimated using the Black-Sholes model, which incorporated assumptions and estimates to value these warrants. We assessed these assumptions and estimates on a periodic basis based on information available to us on each valuation date. Such assumptions and estimates include: the fair value of the Series A and Series C convertible preferred stock, the remaining contractual term of the warrants, the risk-free interest rate applicable to the remaining contractual term, the expected dividend yield and the expected volatility of the price of the underlying common stock into which the preferred stock is convertible. We estimated the fair value of our Series A and Series C convertible preferred stock upon the issuance of the warrants and at each reporting period based upon our common stock valuations which included a derived fair value for such shares of preferred stock. We have historically been a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information of our stock. Therefore, we estimated expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded comparable companies for a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate was determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods that were approximately equal the remaining contractual term of the warrants at each reporting period. We assumed no dividend yield based on the fact that we have never paid or declared dividends, and do not expect to pay or declare dividends in the future.\nUpon completion of the IPO, all outstanding shares of our preferred stock were converted to common stock. The convertible preferred warrants therefore became exercisable into common stock instead of convertible preferred stock and the warrants met the criteria to be classified in stockholders' equity and the fair value of the warrant liability as of the IPO date was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit).\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 353: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35,593\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,950\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,643\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (443\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (257\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (617\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (617\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (700\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (35,648\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,650\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,998\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expense increased by $10.9 million from $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Interest income (expense) net increased $(0.2) million from $(0.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $(0.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net expense was attributable to the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our credit facility in May 2016, as well as a decrease in interest income during the period due to a decrease in average cash, cash equivalents and investment balances prior to the completion of our IPO.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of non-cash changes in the fair value of warrants issued in connection with our credit facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have funded our operations from inception through December 31, 2018 through gross proceeds of $96.0 million from sales of our convertible preferred stock, borrowings of $10.0 million under our credit facilities and net proceeds from our IPO of $67.0 million which was completed in November 2017. Our total cash and cash equivalents was $61.6 million and $94.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOn June 29, 2018, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Pacific Western Bank, or the PWB Loan Agreement. The PWB Loan Agreement provides up to $12.0 million principal in term loans, $10.0 million of which was funded at the time we entered into the agreement, of which we utilized approximately $8.5 million to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our existing loan and security agreement with SVB. The borrowings under the PWB Loan Agreement have an interest rate equal to the greater of 5.0% or the prime rate then in effect.\nThe repayment schedule provides for interest only payments for 18 months, beginning in July 2018, pursuant to the terms of the PWB Loan Agreement. The PWB Loan Agreement provides for extension of the aforementioned 18 month period to 24 months following receipt by us of at least $50 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity securities or an upfront payment from a strategic partnership by December 31, 2019. Following the interest only period, the loan repayment schedule provides for 30 or 24 equal monthly payments of principal plus interest, as the case may be. We have the option to prepay the outstanding balance of the term loan in full, subject to a prepayment fee of 0% to 2% depending upon when the prepayment occurs. In addition, in the event we close one or more financings pursuant to which we receive aggregate gross proceeds in the amount of at least $25.0 million, the PWB Loan Agreement requires us to pay to Pacific Western Bank, or PWB, a one-time fee equal to (a) $200,000, if such fee is paid on or before June 30, 2019 or (b) $300,000, if such fee is paid after June 30, 2019. This obligation survives the termination of the PWB Loan Agreement. The term loan facility matures on June 29, 2022.\nThe borrowings under the PWB Loan Agreement are secured by a lien on all of our assets except intellectual property. The PWB Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by us, including negative covenants restricting our activities, such as disposing of our business or certain assets, incurring additional debt or liens or making payments on other debt, making certain investments and declaring dividends, acquiring or merging with another entity, engaging in transactions with affiliates or encumbering intellectual property, among others. The obligations under the PWB Loan Agreement are subject to acceleration upon occurrence of specified events of default, including a material adverse change in our business, operations or financial or other condition.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 390: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,839\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,065\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,394\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (318\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,762\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (694\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (32,851\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (43,761\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The decrease in cash flows from investing activities of $23.7 million was attributable to maturities of short term investments of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by $1.2 million of purchases of investments during the period, as we converted short-term investments to cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations. We did not have any maturities or purchases of short term investments during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash flows from investing activities of $47.2 million was attributable to a decrease in purchases of short-term investments of $52.0 million and an increase in maturities of short-term investments of $4.8 million, as we converted short-term investments to cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations.\nNet Cash (Used In) Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

These payments were partially offset by $10.0 million of proceeds received under our new credit facility with PWB and $0.1 million received from the exercises of stock options. The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to net proceeds of $67.0 million received from our IPO in November 2017, partially offset by debt repayments of $0.3 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by financing activities of $63.5 million was attributable to net proceeds of $67.0 million received from our IPO in November 20017, partially offset by debt repayments of $0.3 million.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development for, initiate later stage clinical trials for, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the first half of 2020. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 397: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of conducting future clinical trials of reloxaliase;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 398: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of manufacturing additional material for our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical program, planned Phase 2 basket clinical trial and potential future clinical studies we might conduct for reloxaliase;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 399: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of scaling up our manufacturing process for reloxaliase to prepare for the filing of a potential BLA and commercialization if our clinical development program is successful;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 400: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the advancement of ALLN-346;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 401: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for other potential product candidates we may develop, if any;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 402: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 403: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 404: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we might have at such time;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 405: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 406: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 407: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 408: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our business operations and our research and development activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 409: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of operating as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. With the exception of our credit facility, we do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings\nwhen needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 410: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facility (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 411: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Consists of repayment obligations under our credit facility with PWB, including interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 412: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Represents future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases which expire through February 2021.

(now known as Ajinomoto Althea, Inc.), or Althea, which we entered into in March 2012, as amended in March 2016, we reimbursed Althea for patent-related fees of $0.1 million and issued 88,186 shares of common stock to Althea. In addition, we are obligated to pay milestone payments and royalties of a mid-single digit percentage of net sales. Milestone payments are triggered upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones that could total up to $31.0 million and sales-based milestones that could total up to $25.0 million. The milestone payments are not creditable against royalties. Actual amounts due under the agreement will vary depending on the number of products developed, the type and development path of the products, and other related factors. As of December 31, 2018, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales. We have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience upon 60 days prior written notice to Althea. As a result, no amounts are included in the table above. See Business-Althea License Agreement\u201d for a more detailed description of this agreement.\nWe enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials, CMOs for clinical supply manufacturing, professional consultants for expert advice and other vendors for other services for operating purposes. We have not included these payments in the table of contractual obligations above since the contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days prior written notice, therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules.\nTable 413: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a late-stage, clinical biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutics to treat patients with rare and severe metabolic and kidney disorders. We are focused on metabolic disorders that result in excess accumulation of certain metabolites that can cause kidney stones, damage the kidney, and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease, or CKD, and end-stage renal disease. Our lead product candidate, reloxaliase (formerly known as ALLN-177), is a first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutic that we are developing for the treatment of hyperoxaluria, a metabolic disorder characterized by markedly elevated urinary oxalate levels and commonly associated with kidney stones, CKD and other serious kidney diseases. There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of hyperoxaluria.\nWe have conducted a robust clinical development program of reloxaliase, including three Phase 2 clinical trials, which demonstrated reductions of urinary oxalate excretion in patients with secondary hyperoxaluria, particularly in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Reloxaliase has also been well tolerated in clinical trials to date. Based on these data, the high unmet medical need, the enzyme's specific mechanism of action, and the significant market opportunity, we are initially developing reloxaliase for adult patients with enteric hyperoxaluria.\nIn March 2018, we initiated URIROX-1TM (URIROX-1) (formerly Study 301), the first of our two anticipated Phase 3 clinical trials in support of our planned Biologic License Application, or BLA, for reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Based on our enrollment progress to date, we expect to announce topline data from this trial in the second half of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated URIROX-2 (formerly Study 302), our second pivotal Phase 3 trial of reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. The FDA has advised us that it agrees with our strategy to pursue a BLA submission for reloxaliase using the accelerated approval regulatory pathway. We expect to submit a BLA filing to the FDA after 400 patients have been randomized and followed for six months in URIROX-2. For the long-term follow-up phase of the trial, subjects would continue in URIROX-2 for a minimum treatment period of two years to confirm clinical benefit post-approval.\nIn addition to our Phase 3 program of reloxaliase for enteric hyperoxaluria, we are also evaluating reloxaliase in Study 206, a Phase 2 basket trial in adults and adolescents with primary hyperoxaluria or enteric hyperoxaluria with hyperoxalemia, which we initiated in March 2018. We expect to announce interim data from Study 206 in the second quarter of 2019 and topline data from this trial in the second half of 2019.\nIn addition, we have designed our second product candidate, ALLN-346, an orally administered, novel, urate degrading enzyme, for patients with hyperuricemia and gout in the setting of advanced CKD. Hyperuricemia, or elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, results from overproduction or insufficient excretion of urate, or often a combination of the two. ALLN-346 has demonstrated a robust reduction in both plasma and urine uric acid levels in an established urate oxidase knock-out mouse model, a severe animal model of hyperuricemia with advanced CKD and kidney damage due to urate crystal deposition. We presented preclinical data for ALLN-346 in October at the 2018 American College of Rheumatology (ACR/ARHP) Annual Meeting. We are advancing our preclinical program for ALLN-346 and scaling our manufacturing processes for clinical studies. Subject to the successful completion of these activities, we expect to file an IND for ALLN-346 with the FDA in the second half of 2019 and to initiate our first clinical trial of ALLN-346 in patients with hyperuricemia in the first half of 2020.\nOn November 6, 2017, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 5,333,333 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $74.7 million. The underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option on December 1, 2017, and purchased 16,969 shares of our common stock, for aggregate gross\nproceeds of $0.2 million. As a result of the IPO, we received approximately $67.0 million in net proceeds after deducting $7.9 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nOur operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, producing drug substance and drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials, conducting preclinical studies of our product candidates and clinical trials for our lead product candidate, reloxaliase. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue to date. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $61.6 million.\nWe have incurred significant net operating losses in every year since our inception and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Our net losses were $35.6 million, $21.7 million and $24.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $117.6 million. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we:\n \u2022 conduct future clinical trials of our lead product candidate, reloxaliase; \n \u2022 manufacture additional material for our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program and potential future clinical studies we might conduct for our product candidates; \n \u2022 scale up our manufacturing process for reloxaliase to prepare for the filing of a potential Biologics License Application, or BLA, and commercialization if our clinical development program is successful; \n \u2022 advance the development of ALLN-346; \n \u2022 conduct research on the discovery and development of additional product candidates; \n \u2022 seek regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; \n \u2022 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval in geographies in which we plan to commercialize our products ourselves; \n \u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 hire additional staff, including clinical, scientific, technical, operational, and financial personnel, to execute our business plan; and \n \u2022 add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts, and to enable us to operate as a public company. \nWe do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate. Additionally, we currently use contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to carry out our preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not yet have a sales organization. If we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, including strategic collaborations. We may, however, be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our current product candidates, or any additional product candidates, if developed.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales or any other source and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for reloxaliase or other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in marketing approval or collaboration or license\nagreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such collaboration or license agreements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 costs incurred under agreements with third parties, including CROs, that conduct research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf; \n \u2022 costs related to production of preclinical and clinical materials, including fees paid to CMOs; \n \u2022 consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities; \n \u2022 costs of purchasing laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment used in our research and development activities; \n \u2022 costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements; and \n \u2022 facility costs and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, depreciation and other supplies. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as clinical site activations, patient enrollment, or information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and may be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nThe following summarizes our most advanced current research and development programs:\n \u2022 reloxaliase is our lead product candidate which we are developing for the treatment of hyperoxaluria. Substantially all of our research and development costs to date have been used to fund this program. \n \u2022 ALLN-346 is our second product candidate which we are developing for patients with hyperuricemia and CKD. We began incurring external research and development costs for this program in 2016. \nWe typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs and other internal costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by program (in thousands):\nTable 330: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reloxaliase external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ALLN-346 external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Since inception, we have incurred $65.0 million of external research and development\ncosts for reloxaliase and $2.4 million of external research and development costs for ALLN-346. We expect that our research and development costs will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we initiate additional clinical trials of reloxaliase, scale our manufacturing processes and advance development of ALLN-346.\nThe successful development of reloxaliase, ALLN-346 and other potential future product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue and material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies, clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials for reloxaliase; \n \u2022 successful data from our clinical program of reloxaliase that supports an acceptable benefit-risk profile of reloxaliase in the intended populations; \n \u2022 establishing an appropriate safety profile for ALLN-346 and any potential future product candidate with studies to enable the filing of an investigational new drug application; \n \u2022 approval of INDs for ALLN-346 and any potential future product candidate to commence planned or future clinical trials; \n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; \n \u2022 timing and receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 making arrangements with CMOs for third-party commercial manufacturing of our product candidates; \n \u2022 obtaining and maintaining patent and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; \n \u2022 commercializing the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u2022 acceptance of the product, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and \n \u2022 maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development, manufacture or commercialization enabling activities of any of our product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, attorneys and accountants, among other expenses.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net, primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, interest expense incurred on our credit facilities, amortized debt discount related to the fair value of the warrants issued in conjunction with the advances under our former credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB related debt issuance costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, primarily consists of gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions and non-cash changes in the fair value of warrants issued in connection with our former credit facility with SVB. The warrants converted upon the closing of our IPO and therefore became exercisable into common stock instead of convertible preferred stock. The warrants for the purchase of common stock met the criteria to be classified in stockholders' equity and the fair value of the warrant liability as of the IPO date was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit). As a result, we will no longer recognize any changes to the fair value of the warrants through other income (expense).\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing purchase orders and open contracts, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by CROs and CMOs in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe contract with CROs and CMOs to conduct clinical and manufacturing and other research and development services on our behalf. We base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with them. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our CROs or CMOs will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, for stock-based awards granted to employees and directors for their services on the board of directors. We account for stock-based awards to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, or ASC 505-50. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock\noptions as of their grant date. We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make subjective assumptions.\nPursuant to ASC 718, we measure stock-based awards granted to employees and members of the board of directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding stock-based compensation expense of those awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have historically granted stock options with exercise prices equivalent to the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant.\nPursuant to ASC 505-50, we measure stock-based awards granted to consultants at fair value as the awards vest and recognize the resulting value as expense during the period the related services are rendered, which is typically the vesting period. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we re-measure the unvested portion of these awards using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses the following inputs: the fair value of our common stock, the expected volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Due to the lack of a public market for our common stock prior to our IPO and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development, life science industry focus, length of trading history and similar vesting provisions. The historical volatility data is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected option term is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the vesting term (generally four years) of our stock options. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the plain-vanilla\u201d nature of our stock-based awards. The expected term is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole, as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior among our employee population. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term of the arrangement as the basis for the expected term assumption. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.\nThe fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following range of assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 342: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.3% - 3.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9% - 2.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3% - 1.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5 - 6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6 - 6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4 - 6.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81% - 89%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81% - 87%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77% - 84%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fair value of stock options granted to consultants was estimated on the date of grant and as the grants are remeasured over the vesting period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following range of assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 343: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9% - 2.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9 - 10.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89% - 96%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not grant any stock options to consultants during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. These assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our\njudgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different.\nIn the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017, we made an accounting policy election to recognize forfeitures as they occur upon adoption of guidance per ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASU 2016-09. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In reporting periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2017, we estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised the forfeiture rate in subsequent periods as necessary if actual forfeitures differed from estimates.\nThrough December 31, 2016, the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements was based on awards that were ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures were estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. The term forfeitures\u201d is distinct from cancellations\u201d or expirations\u201d and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.\nThe following table summarizes the classification of our stock-based compensation expense recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\nTable 344: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $4.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock option awards, which is expected to be recognized over weighted-average remaining vesting periods of approximately 2.8 years. In future periods, we expect stock-based compensation expense to increase, due in part to our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, potential increases in the value of our common stock and expected additional stock-based awards to continue to attract and retain our employees.\nDetermination of Fair Value of Common Stock\nAs a private company with no active public market for our common stock prior to the completion of our IPO, our board of directors historically determined the fair value of our common stock on each date of grant, with input from management. Our board of directors periodically determined the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. Once a public trading market for our common stock had been established in connection with the completion of our IPO, it is no longer be necessary for us to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for stock options, as the fair value of our common stock will be its trading price on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nWe performed contemporaneous valuations, with the assistance of a third-party specialist, as of November 6, 2014, February 15, 2016, December 31, 2016, April 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $1.17, $1.59, $4.01, $4.88 and $5.72 per share, respectively. In conducting the valuations, we considered all objective and subjective factors that we believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted, including our best estimate of our business condition, prospects and operating performance at each valuation date. Within the valuations performed, a range of factors, assumptions and methodologies were used. The significant factors included:\n \u2022 the lack of an active public market for our common stock and convertible preferred stock; \n \u2022 the prices at which we sold shares of our convertible preferred stock in arm's length transactions and the superior rights, preferences and privileges of the convertible preferred stock relative to our common stock, including the liquidation preferences of our preferred stock; \n \u2022 our results of operations and financial condition, including cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility; \n \u2022 the material risks related to our business; \n \u2022 our stage of development and business strategy; \n \u2022 the composition of, and changes to, our management team and board of directors; \n \u2022 the market performance of publicly traded companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors, as well as recently completed initial public offerings, or IPOs, of companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors; and \n \u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an IPO given prevailing market conditions. \nHistorically, the dates of our contemporaneous valuations have not coincided with the dates of our stock-based compensation grants. In determining the exercise prices of the stock options granted, our board of directors considered, among other things, the most recent contemporaneous valuations of our common stock and our assessment of additional objective and subjective factors we believed were relevant as of the grant date. The additional factors considered when determining any changes in fair value of our common stock between the most recent contemporaneous valuation and the grant dates included the status of our stage of research and development, our operating and financial performance and current business conditions.\nThere were significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of our common stock. These judgments and estimates were management's best estimates and included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to completing an IPO or other liquidity event, the related company valuations associated with such events and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per common share could have been different.\nWarrant Valuation\nWe issued warrants to purchase shares of our Series A and Series C convertible preferred stock in conjunction with the advances made under our former credit facility with SVB. These warrants were classified as liabilities as they either conditionally or unconditionally obligated us to transfer assets regardless of the timing of the redemption feature or price of the underlying convertible preferred stock. The warrants were initially recorded at their grant date fair value and were subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of the warrants were recorded as a component of other income (expense) in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, until the earlier of their exercise or expiration or the completion of a liquidation event, at which time the warrant liability may be reclassified to stockholders' (deficit) equity if the criteria for recording the warrant as an equity instrument were met.\nThe fair value of the warrants was estimated using the Black-Sholes model, which incorporated assumptions and estimates to value these warrants. We assessed these assumptions and estimates on a periodic basis based on information available to us on each valuation date. Such assumptions and estimates include: the fair value of the Series A and Series C convertible preferred stock, the remaining contractual term of the warrants, the risk-free interest rate applicable to the remaining contractual term, the expected dividend yield and the expected volatility of the price of the underlying common stock into which the preferred stock is convertible. We estimated the fair value of our Series A and Series C convertible preferred stock upon the issuance of the warrants and at each reporting period based upon our common stock valuations which included a derived fair value for such shares of preferred stock. We have historically been a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information of our stock. Therefore, we estimated expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded comparable companies for a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate was determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods that were approximately equal the remaining contractual term of the warrants at each reporting period. We assumed no dividend yield based on the fact that we have never paid or declared dividends, and do not expect to pay or declare dividends in the future.\nUpon completion of the IPO, all outstanding shares of our preferred stock were converted to common stock. The convertible preferred warrants therefore became exercisable into common stock instead of convertible preferred stock and the warrants met the criteria to be classified in stockholders' equity and the fair value of the warrant liability as of the IPO date was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit).\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 353: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35,593\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,950\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,643\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (443\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (257\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (617\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (617\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (700\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (35,648\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,650\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,998\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expense increased by $10.9 million from $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Expenses for this study were $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018; \n \u2022 We also initiated our 206 Study during the first quarter of 2018 and incurred $1.6 million of costs for this study during the year ended December 31, 2018; \n \u2022 We initiated our URIROX-2 Study during the fourth quarter of 2018. We began preparation and start-up activities for this study during the second quarter of 2018 and incurred $1.5 million of costs relating to this study during the year ended December 31, 2018; and \n \u2022 The increase in costs due to our URIROX-1 Study, URIROX-2 Study and 206 Study was partially offset by costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, for which there were no comparable costs during the year ended December 31, 2018. We incurred $1.9 million of costs during the year ended December 31, 2017 on the closeout of our 713 and 649 Studies and $0.4 million of costs as we completed our 204 Study. \n \u2022 Our manufacturing external costs increased by $1.9 million from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 Included in manufacturing costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.8 million of costs incurred at our CMOs for the production of engineering and clinical batches of drug substance for our Phase 3 clinical program and $0.7 million of drug product costs for our Phase 3 clinical program; \n \u2022 We purchased consumables and raw materials required for engineering and clinical batches. Our costs for consumables and raw materials were $0.9 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively; \n \u2022 Also included in manufacturing costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.8 million of costs incurred for ALLN-346 formulation and development activities, an increase of $0.2 million in costs from the year ended December 31, 2017; and \n \u2022 Included in manufacturing costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.9 million of costs incurred at our CMO for the production of engineering batches, $1.0 million for consumables and raw materials, $0.6 million of drug product costs and $0.2 of costs for modifications of equipment at our CMO. \n \u2022 Our employee compensation and benefits costs increased by $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in headcount from 22 employees at December 31, 2017 to 37 employees at December 31, 2018 as we grew our clinical and technical operations teams in preparation for our Phase 3 program. \nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we continue our clinical development of reloxaliase, scale our manufacturing processes for reloxaliase and advance development of ALLN-346.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $3.8 million from $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Our stock-based compensation expense increased from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018; \n \u2022 Our consulting and professional services costs increased by $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to increased consulting costs, recruiting costs, accounting and tax costs and other costs incurred as a public company, partially offset by a decrease in legal costs; \n \u2022 Our market research and commercialization planning costs increased by $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we incurred costs of $0.2 million as we engaged an independent third party to conduct a study to assess the market opportunities for reloxaliase in Europe and Asia; and \n \u2022 Our other costs increased by $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to a $0.5 million increase in corporate insurance premiums. Our insurance premiums increased as a result of being a public company. \nWe expect that our general and administrative expense will increase in future periods as we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with being a public company.\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, interest expense charged on our outstanding debt, and amortization of our debt discount. We had net interest income of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and net interest expense of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to interest earned from higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the net proceeds received from our IPO in November 2017.\nLoss On Extinguishment of Debt\nOn June 29, 2018, we terminated our loan agreement with SVB. As a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million representing the unamortized debt discount and the final payment fee associated with the loan.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 371: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,584\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,236\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,950\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,186\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (443\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (200\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (243\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (257\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (121\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (136\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (700\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (379\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,650\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (24,507\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense decreased by $4.6 million from $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

We enrolled our first subject into the trial in September 2015, and completed enrollment in June 2016. The majority of enrollment and CRO expenses were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016; \n \u2022 Study 713 expense decreased by $1.3 million from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We enrolled our first subject into this trial in December 2015 and completed enrollment in early 2017. We incurred significant enrollment, CRO, and associated site costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, and incurred expenses related to the completion of this trial, finalization of the database, analysis of the data, and closeout of the trial during the year ended December 31, 2017; \n \u2022 Consulting expense decreased by $0.3 million from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We required increased consulting services during the year ended December 31, 2016 to support Studies 649 and 713, and less consulting services during the year ended December 31, 2017, as the majority of the work for each study was completed during 2016; and \n \u2022 The decrease in clinical development external costs was partially offset by $0.6 million of start-up expenses associated with URIROX-1, during the year ended December 31, 2017, of which we did not have similar expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Our manufacturing external costs decreased by $3.2 million from $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 We entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with a new CMO for the manufacturing of our reloxaliase drug substance in June 2015. We incurred significant costs setting up the new CMO in the second half of 2015 and the duration of 2016. These start-up costs incurred at this CMO were $0.2 million and $1.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively; \n \u2022 Our costs for consumables and raw materials were $1.0 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased consumables and raw materials to supply our planned pre-engineering, engineering and clinical batches. These consumables and raw materials were expensed at the time of purchase. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased additional consumables and raw materials required for engineering and clinical batches; and \n \u2022 During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we conducted considerable process development and manufactured several pre-engineering and engineering batches of product for reloxaliase as we scaled our manufacturing process and manufactured material for our clinical trials. Costs associated with these activities were $1.0 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n \u2022 Our research and development employee compensation and benefits costs increased by $1.1 million from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to an overall increase in research and development headcount. We had 22 employees in research and development at December 31, 2017 compared to 18 employees in research and development at December 31, 2016. Further, of the 18 employees in research and development at December 31, 2016, eight were hired during the year ended December 31, 2016 but were employed during the entire year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Other costs increased by $0.7 million from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Our costs associated with the development of ALLN-346, increased by $0.3 million from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we continue to advance the development of this program. \n \u2022 Our regulatory costs increased by $0.3 million from $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in costs is primarily attributable to increased consulting services during 2017 to assist us with our communications with the FDA and various regulatory agencies in the European Union. \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $1.3 million from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 386: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consulting and professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market research and commercialization planning\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (229\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable the following:\n \u2022 Our employee compensation and benefits costs increased by $0.7 million. The increase was primarily related to an increase in the number of employees, including the addition of our Chief Financial Officer, who joined us in June 2016. We had eight general and administrative employees at December 31, 2017 compared to seven employees at December 31, 2016. Our stock-based compensation expense also increased $0.2 million from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017; \n \u2022 Our consulting and professional services costs increased by $0.8 million. The increase is primarily related to increased legal costs for general corporate purposes and intellectual property legal costs associated with ALLN-346; and \n \u2022 Our market research and commercialization planning costs decreased by $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we engaged an independent third party to conduct a study to assess the market opportunity for reloxaliase. \nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, interest expense charged on our outstanding debt, and amortization of our debt discount related to the fair value of the warrants and other debt issuance costs. Interest income (expense) net increased $(0.2) million from $(0.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $(0.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net expense was attributable to the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our credit facility in May 2016, as well as a decrease in interest income during the period due to a decrease in average cash, cash equivalents and investment balances prior to the completion of our IPO.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of non-cash changes in the fair value of warrants issued in connection with our credit facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have funded our operations from inception through December 31, 2018 through gross proceeds of $96.0 million from sales of our convertible preferred stock, borrowings of $10.0 million under our credit facilities and net proceeds from our IPO of $67.0 million which was completed in November 2017. Our total cash and cash equivalents was $61.6 million and $94.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOn June 29, 2018, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Pacific Western Bank, or the PWB Loan Agreement. The PWB Loan Agreement provides up to $12.0 million principal in term loans, $10.0 million of which was funded at the time we entered into the agreement, of which we utilized approximately $8.5 million to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our existing loan and security agreement with SVB. The borrowings under the PWB Loan Agreement have an interest rate equal to the greater of 5.0% or the prime rate then in effect.\nThe repayment schedule provides for interest only payments for 18 months, beginning in July 2018, pursuant to the terms of the PWB Loan Agreement. The PWB Loan Agreement provides for extension of the aforementioned 18 month period to 24 months following receipt by us of at least $50 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity securities or an upfront payment from a strategic partnership by December 31, 2019. Following the interest only period, the loan repayment schedule provides for 30 or 24 equal monthly payments of principal plus interest, as the case may be. We have the option to prepay the outstanding balance of the term loan in full, subject to a prepayment fee of 0% to 2% depending upon when the prepayment occurs. In addition, in the event we close one or more financings pursuant to which we receive aggregate gross proceeds in the amount of at least $25.0 million, the PWB Loan Agreement requires us to pay to Pacific Western Bank, or PWB, a one-time fee equal to (a) $200,000, if such fee is paid on or before June 30, 2019 or (b) $300,000, if such fee is paid after June 30, 2019. This obligation survives the termination of the PWB Loan Agreement. The term loan facility matures on June 29, 2022.\nThe borrowings under the PWB Loan Agreement are secured by a lien on all of our assets except intellectual property. The PWB Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by us, including negative covenants restricting our activities, such as disposing of our business or certain assets, incurring additional debt or liens or making payments on other debt, making certain investments and declaring dividends, acquiring or merging with another entity, engaging in transactions with affiliates or encumbering intellectual property, among others. The obligations under the PWB Loan Agreement are subject to acceleration upon occurrence of specified events of default, including a material adverse change in our business, operations or financial or other condition.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 390: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,839\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,065\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,394\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (318\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,762\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (694\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (32,851\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (43,761\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used in operating activities of $10.7 million was attributable to:\n \u2022 an increase in net loss of $14.0 million; \n \u2022 an increase in non-cash items of $1.7 million resulting primarily from increases in stock-based compensation expense and our loss on extinguishment of debt; and \n \u2022 an increase of $1.6 million in changes in the components of working capital, including increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets. \nNet cash used in operating activities was $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash used in operating activities of $2.3 million was attributable to:\n \u2022 a decrease in net loss of $2.9 million; \n \u2022 An increase in non-cash items of $0.4 million resulting primarily from increases in stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense and the change in the fair market value of the warrant liability, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of premium on investments; and \n \u2022 A decrease of $1.0 million in changes in the components of working capital, including an decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. \nNet Cash (Used In) Provided by Investing Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash flows from investing activities of $23.7 million was attributable to maturities of short term investments of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by $1.2 million of purchases of investments during the period, as we converted short-term investments to cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations. We did not have any maturities or purchases of short term investments during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash flows from investing activities of $47.2 million was attributable to a decrease in purchases of short-term investments of $52.0 million and an increase in maturities of short-term investments of $4.8 million, as we converted short-term investments to cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations.\nNet Cash (Used In) Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $10.5 million used to pay off our credit facility with SVB and $0.2 million for payments of initial public offering costs that were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at December 31, 2017. These payments were partially offset by $10.0 million of proceeds received under our new credit facility with PWB and $0.1 million received from the exercises of stock options. The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to net proceeds of $67.0 million received from our IPO in November 2017, partially offset by debt repayments of $0.3 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by financing activities of $63.5 million was attributable to net proceeds of $67.0 million received from our IPO in November 20017, partially offset by debt repayments of $0.3 million.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development for, initiate later stage clinical trials for, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the first half of 2020. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the costs of conducting future clinical trials of reloxaliase; \n \u2022 the costs of manufacturing additional material for our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical program, planned Phase 2 basket clinical trial and potential future clinical studies we might conduct for reloxaliase; \n \u2022 the costs of scaling up our manufacturing process for reloxaliase to prepare for the filing of a potential BLA and commercialization if our clinical development program is successful; \n \u2022 the advancement of ALLN-346; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for other potential product candidates we may develop, if any; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; \n \u2022 the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we might have at such time; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; \n \u2022 the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval; \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; \n \u2022 our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our business operations and our research and development activities; and \n \u2022 the costs of operating as a public company. \nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. With the exception of our credit facility, we do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings\nwhen needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 410: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facility (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Consists of repayment obligations under our credit facility with PWB, including interest. \n (2) Represents future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases which expire through February 2021. The minimum lease payments above do not include any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes. \nUnder a license agreement with Althea Technologies, Inc. (now known as Ajinomoto Althea, Inc.), or Althea, which we entered into in March 2012, as amended in March 2016, we reimbursed Althea for patent-related fees of $0.1 million and issued 88,186 shares of common stock to Althea. In addition, we are obligated to pay milestone payments and royalties of a mid-single digit percentage of net sales. Milestone payments are triggered upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones that could total up to $31.0 million and sales-based milestones that could total up to $25.0 million. The milestone payments are not creditable against royalties. Actual amounts due under the agreement will vary depending on the number of products developed, the type and development path of the products, and other related factors. As of December 31, 2018, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales. We have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience upon 60 days prior written notice to Althea. As a result, no amounts are included in the table above. See Business-Althea License Agreement\u201d for a more detailed description of this agreement.\nWe enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials, CMOs for clinical supply manufacturing, professional consultants for expert advice and other vendors for other services for operating purposes. We have not included these payments in the table of contractual obligations above since the contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days prior written notice, therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules.\nTable 413: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a late-stage, clinical biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutics to treat patients with rare and severe metabolic and kidney disorders. We are focused on metabolic disorders that result in excess accumulation of certain metabolites that can cause kidney stones, damage the kidney, and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease, or CKD, and end-stage renal disease. Our lead product candidate, reloxaliase (formerly known as ALLN-177), is a first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutic that we are developing for the treatment of hyperoxaluria, a metabolic disorder characterized by markedly elevated urinary oxalate levels and commonly associated with kidney stones, CKD and other serious kidney diseases. There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of hyperoxaluria.\nWe have conducted a robust clinical development program of reloxaliase, including three Phase 2 clinical trials, which demonstrated reductions of urinary oxalate excretion in patients with secondary hyperoxaluria, particularly in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Reloxaliase has also been well tolerated in clinical trials to date. Based on these data, the high unmet medical need, the enzyme's specific mechanism of action, and the significant market opportunity, we are initially developing reloxaliase for adult patients with enteric hyperoxaluria.\nIn March 2018, we initiated URIROX-1TM (URIROX-1) (formerly Study 301), the first of our two anticipated Phase 3 clinical trials in support of our planned Biologic License Application, or BLA, for reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Based on our enrollment progress to date, we expect to announce topline data from this trial in the second half of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated URIROX-2 (formerly Study 302), our second pivotal Phase 3 trial of reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. The FDA has advised us that it agrees with our strategy to pursue a BLA submission for reloxaliase using the accelerated approval regulatory pathway. We expect to submit a BLA filing to the FDA after 400 patients have been randomized and followed for six months in URIROX-2. For the long-term follow-up phase of the trial, subjects would continue in URIROX-2 for a minimum treatment period of two years to confirm clinical benefit post-approval.\nIn addition to our Phase 3 program of reloxaliase for enteric hyperoxaluria, we are also evaluating reloxaliase in Study 206, a Phase 2 basket trial in adults and adolescents with primary hyperoxaluria or enteric hyperoxaluria with hyperoxalemia, which we initiated in March 2018. We expect to announce interim data from Study 206 in the second quarter of 2019 and topline data from this trial in the second half of 2019.\nIn addition, we have designed our second product candidate, ALLN-346, an orally administered, novel, urate degrading enzyme, for patients with hyperuricemia and gout in the setting of advanced CKD. Hyperuricemia, or elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, results from overproduction or insufficient excretion of urate, or often a combination of the two. ALLN-346 has demonstrated a robust reduction in both plasma and urine uric acid levels in an established urate oxidase knock-out mouse model, a severe animal model of hyperuricemia with advanced CKD and kidney damage due to urate crystal deposition. We presented preclinical data for ALLN-346 in October at the 2018 American College of Rheumatology (ACR/ARHP) Annual Meeting. We are advancing our preclinical program for ALLN-346 and scaling our manufacturing processes for clinical studies. Subject to the successful completion of these activities, we expect to file an IND for ALLN-346 with the FDA in the second half of 2019 and to initiate our first clinical trial of ALLN-346 in patients with hyperuricemia in the first half of 2020.\nOn November 6, 2017, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 5,333,333 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $74.7 million. The underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option on December 1, 2017, and purchased 16,969 shares of our common stock, for aggregate gross\nproceeds of $0.2 million. As a result of the IPO, we received approximately $67.0 million in net proceeds after deducting $7.9 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nOur operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, producing drug substance and drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials, conducting preclinical studies of our product candidates and clinical trials for our lead product candidate, reloxaliase. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue to date. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $61.6 million.\nWe have incurred significant net operating losses in every year since our inception and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Our net losses were $35.6 million, $21.7 million and $24.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $117.6 million. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we:\n \u2022 conduct future clinical trials of our lead product candidate, reloxaliase; \n \u2022 manufacture additional material for our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program and potential future clinical studies we might conduct for our product candidates; \n \u2022 scale up our manufacturing process for reloxaliase to prepare for the filing of a potential Biologics License Application, or BLA, and commercialization if our clinical development program is successful; \n \u2022 advance the development of ALLN-346; \n \u2022 conduct research on the discovery and development of additional product candidates; \n \u2022 seek regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; \n \u2022 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval in geographies in which we plan to commercialize our products ourselves; \n \u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 hire additional staff, including clinical, scientific, technical, operational, and financial personnel, to execute our business plan; and \n \u2022 add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts, and to enable us to operate as a public company. \nWe do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate. Additionally, we currently use contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to carry out our preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not yet have a sales organization. If we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, including strategic collaborations. We may, however, be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our current product candidates, or any additional product candidates, if developed.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales or any other source and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for reloxaliase or other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in marketing approval or collaboration or license\nagreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such collaboration or license agreements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 costs incurred under agreements with third parties, including CROs, that conduct research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf; \n \u2022 costs related to production of preclinical and clinical materials, including fees paid to CMOs; \n \u2022 consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities; \n \u2022 costs of purchasing laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment used in our research and development activities; \n \u2022 costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements; and \n \u2022 facility costs and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, depreciation and other supplies. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as clinical site activations, patient enrollment, or information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and may be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nThe following summarizes our most advanced current research and development programs:\n \u2022 reloxaliase is our lead product candidate which we are developing for the treatment of hyperoxaluria. Substantially all of our research and development costs to date have been used to fund this program. \n \u2022 ALLN-346 is our second product candidate which we are developing for patients with hyperuricemia and CKD. We began incurring external research and development costs for this program in 2016. \nWe typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs and other internal costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by program (in thousands):\n\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Since inception, we have incurred $65.0 million of external research and development\ncosts for reloxaliase and $2.4 million of external research and development costs for ALLN-346. We expect that our research and development costs will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we initiate additional clinical trials of reloxaliase, scale our manufacturing processes and advance development of ALLN-346.\nThe successful development of reloxaliase, ALLN-346 and other potential future product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue and material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies, clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials for reloxaliase; \n \u2022 successful data from our clinical program of reloxaliase that supports an acceptable benefit-risk profile of reloxaliase in the intended populations; \n \u2022 establishing an appropriate safety profile for ALLN-346 and any potential future product candidate with studies to enable the filing of an investigational new drug application; \n \u2022 approval of INDs for ALLN-346 and any potential future product candidate to commence planned or future clinical trials; \n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; \n \u2022 timing and receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 making arrangements with CMOs for third-party commercial manufacturing of our product candidates; \n \u2022 obtaining and maintaining patent and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; \n \u2022 commercializing the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u2022 acceptance of the product, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and \n \u2022 maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development, manufacture or commercialization enabling activities of any of our product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, attorneys and accountants, among other expenses.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net, primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, interest expense incurred on our credit facilities, amortized debt discount related to the fair value of the warrants issued in conjunction with the advances under our former credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB related debt issuance costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, primarily consists of gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions and non-cash changes in the fair value of warrants issued in connection with our former credit facility with SVB. The warrants converted upon the closing of our IPO and therefore became exercisable into common stock instead of convertible preferred stock. The warrants for the purchase of common stock met the criteria to be classified in stockholders' equity and the fair value of the warrant liability as of the IPO date was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit). As a result, we will no longer recognize any changes to the fair value of the warrants through other income (expense).\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing purchase orders and open contracts, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by CROs and CMOs in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe contract with CROs and CMOs to conduct clinical and manufacturing and other research and development services on our behalf. We base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with them. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our CROs or CMOs will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, for stock-based awards granted to employees and directors for their services on the board of directors. We account for stock-based awards to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, or ASC 505-50. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock\noptions as of their grant date. We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make subjective assumptions.\nPursuant to ASC 718, we measure stock-based awards granted to employees and members of the board of directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding stock-based compensation expense of those awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have historically granted stock options with exercise prices equivalent to the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant.\nPursuant to ASC 505-50, we measure stock-based awards granted to consultants at fair value as the awards vest and recognize the resulting value as expense during the period the related services are rendered, which is typically the vesting period. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we re-measure the unvested portion of these awards using the then-current fair value of our common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses the following inputs: the fair value of our common stock, the expected volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Due to the lack of a public market for our common stock prior to our IPO and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development, life science industry focus, length of trading history and similar vesting provisions. The historical volatility data is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected option term is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the vesting term (generally four years) of our stock options. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the plain-vanilla\u201d nature of our stock-based awards. The expected term is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole, as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior among our employee population. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term of the arrangement as the basis for the expected term assumption. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.\nThe fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following range of assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\nThe fair value of stock options granted to consultants was estimated on the date of grant and as the grants are remeasured over the vesting period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following range of assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2016:\n\nWe did not grant any stock options to consultants during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. These assumptions represented our best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our\njudgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different.\nIn the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017, we made an accounting policy election to recognize forfeitures as they occur upon adoption of guidance per ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASU 2016-09. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In reporting periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2017, we estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised the forfeiture rate in subsequent periods as necessary if actual forfeitures differed from estimates.\nThrough December 31, 2016, the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements was based on awards that were ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures were estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. The term forfeitures\u201d is distinct from cancellations\u201d or expirations\u201d and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.\nThe following table summarizes the classification of our stock-based compensation expense recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $4.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock option awards, which is expected to be recognized over weighted-average remaining vesting periods of approximately 2.8 years. In future periods, we expect stock-based compensation expense to increase, due in part to our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, potential increases in the value of our common stock and expected additional stock-based awards to continue to attract and retain our employees.\nDetermination of Fair Value of Common Stock\nAs a private company with no active public market for our common stock prior to the completion of our IPO, our board of directors historically determined the fair value of our common stock on each date of grant, with input from management. Our board of directors periodically determined the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid. Once a public trading market for our common stock had been established in connection with the completion of our IPO, it is no longer be necessary for us to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for stock options, as the fair value of our common stock will be its trading price on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nWe performed contemporaneous valuations, with the assistance of a third-party specialist, as of November 6, 2014, February 15, 2016, December 31, 2016, April 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $1.17, $1.59, $4.01, $4.88 and $5.72 per share, respectively. In conducting the valuations, we considered all objective and subjective factors that we believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted, including our best estimate of our business condition, prospects and operating performance at each valuation date. Within the valuations performed, a range of factors, assumptions and methodologies were used. The significant factors included:\n \u2022 the lack of an active public market for our common stock and convertible preferred stock; \n \u2022 the prices at which we sold shares of our convertible preferred stock in arm's length transactions and the superior rights, preferences and privileges of the convertible preferred stock relative to our common stock, including the liquidation preferences of our preferred stock; \n \u2022 our results of operations and financial condition, including cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility; \n \u2022 the material risks related to our business; \n \u2022 our stage of development and business strategy; \n \u2022 the composition of, and changes to, our management team and board of directors; \n \u2022 the market performance of publicly traded companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors, as well as recently completed initial public offerings, or IPOs, of companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors; and \n \u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an IPO given prevailing market conditions. \nHistorically, the dates of our contemporaneous valuations have not coincided with the dates of our stock-based compensation grants. In determining the exercise prices of the stock options granted, our board of directors considered, among other things, the most recent contemporaneous valuations of our common stock and our assessment of additional objective and subjective factors we believed were relevant as of the grant date. The additional factors considered when determining any changes in fair value of our common stock between the most recent contemporaneous valuation and the grant dates included the status of our stage of research and development, our operating and financial performance and current business conditions.\nThere were significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of our common stock. These judgments and estimates were management's best estimates and included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to completing an IPO or other liquidity event, the related company valuations associated with such events and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per common share could have been different.\nWarrant Valuation\nWe issued warrants to purchase shares of our Series A and Series C convertible preferred stock in conjunction with the advances made under our former credit facility with SVB. These warrants were classified as liabilities as they either conditionally or unconditionally obligated us to transfer assets regardless of the timing of the redemption feature or price of the underlying convertible preferred stock. The warrants were initially recorded at their grant date fair value and were subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of the warrants were recorded as a component of other income (expense) in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, until the earlier of their exercise or expiration or the completion of a liquidation event, at which time the warrant liability may be reclassified to stockholders' (deficit) equity if the criteria for recording the warrant as an equity instrument were met.\nThe fair value of the warrants was estimated using the Black-Sholes model, which incorporated assumptions and estimates to value these warrants. We assessed these assumptions and estimates on a periodic basis based on information available to us on each valuation date. Such assumptions and estimates include: the fair value of the Series A and Series C convertible preferred stock, the remaining contractual term of the warrants, the risk-free interest rate applicable to the remaining contractual term, the expected dividend yield and the expected volatility of the price of the underlying common stock into which the preferred stock is convertible. We estimated the fair value of our Series A and Series C convertible preferred stock upon the issuance of the warrants and at each reporting period based upon our common stock valuations which included a derived fair value for such shares of preferred stock. We have historically been a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information of our stock. Therefore, we estimated expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded comparable companies for a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate was determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods that were approximately equal the remaining contractual term of the warrants at each reporting period. We assumed no dividend yield based on the fact that we have never paid or declared dividends, and do not expect to pay or declare dividends in the future.\nUpon completion of the IPO, all outstanding shares of our preferred stock were converted to common stock. The convertible preferred warrants therefore became exercisable into common stock instead of convertible preferred stock and the warrants met the criteria to be classified in stockholders' equity and the fair value of the warrant liability as of the IPO date was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit).\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expense increased by $10.9 million from $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nThe $10.9 million increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the following:\n \u2022 Our clinical development external costs increased by $6.6 million from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018: \n \u2022 We initiated our URIROX-1 Study during the first quarter of 2018. Expenses for this study were $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018; \n \u2022 We also initiated our 206 Study during the first quarter of 2018 and incurred $1.6 million of costs for this study during the year ended December 31, 2018; \n \u2022 We initiated our URIROX-2 Study during the fourth quarter of 2018. We began preparation and start-up activities for this study during the second quarter of 2018 and incurred $1.5 million of costs relating to this study during the year ended December 31, 2018; and \n \u2022 The increase in costs due to our URIROX-1 Study, URIROX-2 Study and 206 Study was partially offset by costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, for which there were no comparable costs during the year ended December 31, 2018. We incurred $1.9 million of costs during the year ended December 31, 2017 on the closeout of our 713 and 649 Studies and $0.4 million of costs as we completed our 204 Study. \n \u2022 Our manufacturing external costs increased by $1.9 million from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 Included in manufacturing costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.8 million of costs incurred at our CMOs for the production of engineering and clinical batches of drug substance for our Phase 3 clinical program and $0.7 million of drug product costs for our Phase 3 clinical program; \n \u2022 We purchased consumables and raw materials required for engineering and clinical batches. Our costs for consumables and raw materials were $0.9 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively; \n \u2022 Also included in manufacturing costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.8 million of costs incurred for ALLN-346 formulation and development activities, an increase of $0.2 million in costs from the year ended December 31, 2017; and \n \u2022 Included in manufacturing costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.9 million of costs incurred at our CMO for the production of engineering batches, $1.0 million for consumables and raw materials, $0.6 million of drug product costs and $0.2 of costs for modifications of equipment at our CMO. \n \u2022 Our employee compensation and benefits costs increased by $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in headcount from 22 employees at December 31, 2017 to 37 employees at December 31, 2018 as we grew our clinical and technical operations teams in preparation for our Phase 3 program. \nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we continue our clinical development of reloxaliase, scale our manufacturing processes for reloxaliase and advance development of ALLN-346.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $3.8 million from $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nThe $3.8 million increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to the following:\n \u2022 Our employee compensation and benefits costs increased by $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in employee salaries, wages, benefit costs and stock-based compensation. Our stock-based compensation expense increased from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018; \n \u2022 Our consulting and professional services costs increased by $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to increased consulting costs, recruiting costs, accounting and tax costs and other costs incurred as a public company, partially offset by a decrease in legal costs; \n \u2022 Our market research and commercialization planning costs increased by $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we incurred costs of $0.2 million as we engaged an independent third party to conduct a study to assess the market opportunities for reloxaliase in Europe and Asia; and \n \u2022 Our other costs increased by $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to a $0.5 million increase in corporate insurance premiums. Our insurance premiums increased as a result of being a public company. \nWe expect that our general and administrative expense will increase in future periods as we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with being a public company.\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, interest expense charged on our outstanding debt, and amortization of our debt discount. We had net interest income of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and net interest expense of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to interest earned from higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the net proceeds received from our IPO in November 2017.\nLoss On Extinguishment of Debt\nOn June 29, 2018, we terminated our loan agreement with SVB. As a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million representing the unamortized debt discount and the final payment fee associated with the loan.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense decreased by $4.6 million from $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the following:\n \u2022 Our clinical development external costs decreased by $3.2 million from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Study 649 expense decreased by $2.0 million from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We enrolled our first subject into the trial in September 2015, and completed enrollment in June 2016. The majority of enrollment and CRO expenses were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016; \n \u2022 Study 713 expense decreased by $1.3 million from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We enrolled our first subject into this trial in December 2015 and completed enrollment in early 2017. We incurred significant enrollment, CRO, and associated site costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, and incurred expenses related to the completion of this trial, finalization of the database, analysis of the data, and closeout of the trial during the year ended December 31, 2017; \n \u2022 Consulting expense decreased by $0.3 million from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We required increased consulting services during the year ended December 31, 2016 to support Studies 649 and 713, and less consulting services during the year ended December 31, 2017, as the majority of the work for each study was completed during 2016; and \n \u2022 The decrease in clinical development external costs was partially offset by $0.6 million of start-up expenses associated with URIROX-1, during the year ended December 31, 2017, of which we did not have similar expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Our manufacturing external costs decreased by $3.2 million from $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 We entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with a new CMO for the manufacturing of our reloxaliase drug substance in June 2015. We incurred significant costs setting up the new CMO in the second half of 2015 and the duration of 2016. These start-up costs incurred at this CMO were $0.2 million and $1.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively; \n \u2022 Our costs for consumables and raw materials were $1.0 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased consumables and raw materials to supply our planned pre-engineering, engineering and clinical batches. These consumables and raw materials were expensed at the time of purchase. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased additional consumables and raw materials required for engineering and clinical batches; and \n \u2022 During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we conducted considerable process development and manufactured several pre-engineering and engineering batches of product for reloxaliase as we scaled our manufacturing process and manufactured material for our clinical trials. Costs associated with these activities were $1.0 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n \u2022 Our research and development employee compensation and benefits costs increased by $1.1 million from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to an overall increase in research and development headcount. We had 22 employees in research and development at December 31, 2017 compared to 18 employees in research and development at December 31, 2016. Further, of the 18 employees in research and development at December 31, 2016, eight were hired during the year ended December 31, 2016 but were employed during the entire year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Other costs increased by $0.7 million from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 Our costs associated with the development of ALLN-346, increased by $0.3 million from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we continue to advance the development of this program. \n \u2022 Our regulatory costs increased by $0.3 million from $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in costs is primarily attributable to increased consulting services during 2017 to assist us with our communications with the FDA and various regulatory agencies in the European Union. \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $1.3 million from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable the following:\n \u2022 Our employee compensation and benefits costs increased by $0.7 million. The increase was primarily related to an increase in the number of employees, including the addition of our Chief Financial Officer, who joined us in June 2016. We had eight general and administrative employees at December 31, 2017 compared to seven employees at December 31, 2016. Our stock-based compensation expense also increased $0.2 million from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017; \n \u2022 Our consulting and professional services costs increased by $0.8 million. The increase is primarily related to increased legal costs for general corporate purposes and intellectual property legal costs associated with ALLN-346; and \n \u2022 Our market research and commercialization planning costs decreased by $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we engaged an independent third party to conduct a study to assess the market opportunity for reloxaliase. \nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, interest expense charged on our outstanding debt, and amortization of our debt discount related to the fair value of the warrants and other debt issuance costs. Interest income (expense) net increased $(0.2) million from $(0.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $(0.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net expense was attributable to the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our credit facility in May 2016, as well as a decrease in interest income during the period due to a decrease in average cash, cash equivalents and investment balances prior to the completion of our IPO.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of non-cash changes in the fair value of warrants issued in connection with our credit facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have funded our operations from inception through December 31, 2018 through gross proceeds of $96.0 million from sales of our convertible preferred stock, borrowings of $10.0 million under our credit facilities and net proceeds from our IPO of $67.0 million which was completed in November 2017. Our total cash and cash equivalents was $61.6 million and $94.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOn June 29, 2018, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Pacific Western Bank, or the PWB Loan Agreement. The PWB Loan Agreement provides up to $12.0 million principal in term loans, $10.0 million of which was funded at the time we entered into the agreement, of which we utilized approximately $8.5 million to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our existing loan and security agreement with SVB. The borrowings under the PWB Loan Agreement have an interest rate equal to the greater of 5.0% or the prime rate then in effect.\nThe repayment schedule provides for interest only payments for 18 months, beginning in July 2018, pursuant to the terms of the PWB Loan Agreement. The PWB Loan Agreement provides for extension of the aforementioned 18 month period to 24 months following receipt by us of at least $50 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity securities or an upfront payment from a strategic partnership by December 31, 2019. Following the interest only period, the loan repayment schedule provides for 30 or 24 equal monthly payments of principal plus interest, as the case may be. We have the option to prepay the outstanding balance of the term loan in full, subject to a prepayment fee of 0% to 2% depending upon when the prepayment occurs. In addition, in the event we close one or more financings pursuant to which we receive aggregate gross proceeds in the amount of at least $25.0 million, the PWB Loan Agreement requires us to pay to Pacific Western Bank, or PWB, a one-time fee equal to (a) $200,000, if such fee is paid on or before June 30, 2019 or (b) $300,000, if such fee is paid after June 30, 2019. This obligation survives the termination of the PWB Loan Agreement. The term loan facility matures on June 29, 2022.\nThe borrowings under the PWB Loan Agreement are secured by a lien on all of our assets except intellectual property. The PWB Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by us, including negative covenants restricting our activities, such as disposing of our business or certain assets, incurring additional debt or liens or making payments on other debt, making certain investments and declaring dividends, acquiring or merging with another entity, engaging in transactions with affiliates or encumbering intellectual property, among others. The obligations under the PWB Loan Agreement are subject to acceleration upon occurrence of specified events of default, including a material adverse change in our business, operations or financial or other condition.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used in operating activities of $10.7 million was attributable to:\n \u2022 an increase in net loss of $14.0 million; \n \u2022 an increase in non-cash items of $1.7 million resulting primarily from increases in stock-based compensation expense and our loss on extinguishment of debt; and \n \u2022 an increase of $1.6 million in changes in the components of working capital, including increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets. \nNet cash used in operating activities was $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash used in operating activities of $2.3 million was attributable to:\n \u2022 a decrease in net loss of $2.9 million; \n \u2022 An increase in non-cash items of $0.4 million resulting primarily from increases in stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense and the change in the fair market value of the warrant liability, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of premium on investments; and \n \u2022 A decrease of $1.0 million in changes in the components of working capital, including an decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. \nNet Cash (Used In) Provided by Investing Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash flows from investing activities of $23.7 million was attributable to maturities of short term investments of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by $1.2 million of purchases of investments during the period, as we converted short-term investments to cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations. We did not have any maturities or purchases of short term investments during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash flows from investing activities of $47.2 million was attributable to a decrease in purchases of short-term investments of $52.0 million and an increase in maturities of short-term investments of $4.8 million, as we converted short-term investments to cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations.\nNet Cash (Used In) Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $10.5 million used to pay off our credit facility with SVB and $0.2 million for payments of initial public offering costs that were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at December 31, 2017. These payments were partially offset by $10.0 million of proceeds received under our new credit facility with PWB and $0.1 million received from the exercises of stock options. The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to net proceeds of $67.0 million received from our IPO in November 2017, partially offset by debt repayments of $0.3 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by financing activities of $63.5 million was attributable to net proceeds of $67.0 million received from our IPO in November 20017, partially offset by debt repayments of $0.3 million.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development for, initiate later stage clinical trials for, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the first half of 2020. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the costs of conducting future clinical trials of reloxaliase; \n \u2022 the costs of manufacturing additional material for our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical program, planned Phase 2 basket clinical trial and potential future clinical studies we might conduct for reloxaliase; \n \u2022 the costs of scaling up our manufacturing process for reloxaliase to prepare for the filing of a potential BLA and commercialization if our clinical development program is successful; \n \u2022 the advancement of ALLN-346; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for other potential product candidates we may develop, if any; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; \n \u2022 the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we might have at such time; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; \n \u2022 the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval; \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; \n \u2022 our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our business operations and our research and development activities; and \n \u2022 the costs of operating as a public company. \nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. With the exception of our credit facility, we do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings\nwhen needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Consists of repayment obligations under our credit facility with PWB, including interest. \n (2) Represents future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases which expire through February 2021. The minimum lease payments above do not include any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes. \nUnder a license agreement with Althea Technologies, Inc. (now known as Ajinomoto Althea, Inc.), or Althea, which we entered into in March 2012, as amended in March 2016, we reimbursed Althea for patent-related fees of $0.1 million and issued 88,186 shares of common stock to Althea. In addition, we are obligated to pay milestone payments and royalties of a mid-single digit percentage of net sales. Milestone payments are triggered upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones that could total up to $31.0 million and sales-based milestones that could total up to $25.0 million. The milestone payments are not creditable against royalties. Actual amounts due under the agreement will vary depending on the number of products developed, the type and development path of the products, and other related factors. As of December 31, 2018, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales. We have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience upon 60 days prior written notice to Althea. As a result, no amounts are included in the table above. See Business-Althea License Agreement\u201d for a more detailed description of this agreement.\nWe enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials, CMOs for clinical supply manufacturing, professional consultants for expert advice and other vendors for other services for operating purposes. We have not included these payments in the table of contractual obligations above since the contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days prior written notice, therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules.\nTable 413: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 330: <table> <tr>

biopharmaceutical company. The company, which focuses on developing oral enzyme therapeutics for rare and severe metabolic and kidney disorders, emphasizes its lead product, reloxaliase, designed to treat hyperoxaluria. There are no therapies approved for hyperoxaluria, marking a significant market opportunity for reloxaliase. The company has completed three Phase 2 clinical trials and is advancing through Phase 3 trials (URIROX-1 and URIROX-2) with plans to file a Biologic License Application. They also have a second product candidate, ALLN-346, for patients with gout in the setting of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nFinancially, the company has completed an IPO, raising substantial funds, but continues to operate at a net loss and has a significant accumulated deficit. They expect increasing expenses as they move forward with clinical trials, scale-up manufacturing, further product development, and prepare for commercialization and regulatory submissions. Their research and development expenses have increased significantly, and general and administrative expenses are also rising as they expand their operations. The company has net interest income due to higher average cash balances post-IPO. They anticipate increased cash needs and may seek additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, or licensing arrangements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $61.6 million, which they believe will allow them to fund operations through at least the first half of 2020. They have significant contractual obligations related to a credit facility and operating lease commitments. They also have agreements that could result in future milestone payments and royalties dependent on the development and success of their products.\n\n**Note:** The actual report would include numerical details and specific financial data which are summarized here due to the length and complexity of the original text."}
