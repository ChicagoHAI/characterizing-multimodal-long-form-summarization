Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including the factors we describe under Item 1A - Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in connection with, the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereof. Components of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include:\n\u2022Overview\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Non-GAAP Measures\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Contractual Obligations\n\u2022Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOVERVIEW\nAt Vonage, our vision is to accelerate the world's ability to connect. We are observing a secular change in the way business is done, with a fundamental shift in how communications technologies are being leveraged in almost every industry. Through the Vonage Communications Platform, our strategy is to deliver a single leading cloud communications platform that powers our customers' and partners' global engagement solutions using our APIs, Unified Communications, and Contact Center innovations. We believe that the Vonage Communications Platform's products and services are well positioned to take advantage of emerging trends with sizable, growing total addressable markets as companies look to cloud-based communications solutions and API programming architectures as part of their digital transformation.\nOur business is organized under two reportable operating segments: Vonage Communications Platform and Consumer. The Vonage Communications Platform includes our Unified Communications, Contact Center Communications, and APIs service offerings and represents the Company's strategic business as the source of future growth. Our Consumer segment includes our communications solutions for residential customers based on our roots in providing VoIP communication services.\n29 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nImpact of COVID-19\nA novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, was first identified in China in December 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization. To date, COVID-19 has impacted nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns worldwide. The full impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and financial results has and will depend on various factors that continue to evolve, which we may not accurately predict. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments across the world have enacted measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus, including the practice of social distancing when engaging in authorized activities. While some of these restrictions have been lifted on a global scale, many regions, including the United States where Vonage is headquartered, are experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 variants. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, typical business travel remains at reduced levels to protect the health of our employees and to comply with local guidelines, and we have also continued modified usage of Vonage offices worldwide to comply with social distancing (including our corporate headquarters), all of which disrupt how we typically operate our business.\nCOVID-19 has impacted some of our customers more than others, including customers in the travel, hospitality, retail, and other industries where physical interaction is critical. We have experienced and expect that we will continue to experience slowdowns in bookings and customer payments, customer churn and reduced usage, and issuance of customer credits to distressed customers served by certain product lines in the Vonage Communications Platform. In addition, COVID-19 may have impacts on many additional aspects of our operations, directly and indirectly, including with respect to its impacts on customer behaviors, our business and our employees, and the market generally, and the scope and nature of these impacts continue to evolve each day.\nRecent Significant Events\nOn November 22, 2021, the Company, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ) (\"Ericsson\"), and Ericsson Muon Holding Inc., entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") providing for the acquisition of the Company by Ericsson for approximately $6.2 billion in cash. The proposed transaction received the required approval of the Company's stockholders on February 9, 2022 and is expected to be consummated during the first half of 2022 following the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions.\nOn October 18, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Jumper AI Pte. Ltd. for cash consideration of $7 million. The Company expects to allocate the purchase price primarily to developed technology and customer relationships. The Company may make additional payments of up to $9 million over the next two years subject to continuing employment of key individuals and achievement of certain financial targets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a new lease agreement to relocate its corporate headquarters to a new leased facility located in Holmdel, New Jersey. As a result, the Company expects to incur a charge associated with the abandonment of its former corporate headquarters in early 2022 upon successful relocation.\nTrends in Our Industry\nA number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements.\nCompetitive landscape. The business cloud communications markets and consumer services market in which we participate are highly competitive. We face competition from a broad set of companies, including (i) SaaS companies, CCaaS companies, other alternative communication providers, other providers of cloud communication services and (ii) traditional telephone, wireless service providers, cable companies, and alternative communications providers with consumer offerings. As the cloud communications market evolves, and the convergence of voice, video, messaging, mobility and data networking technologies accelerates, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete in the market, including companies that currently compete in other sectors, companies that serve consumers rather than business customers, or companies which expand their market presence to include cloud communications. Moreover, as businesses and educational institutions are quickly pivoting to cloud-based communications in light the increased need for remote work and remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are experiencing intense competition from our existing competitors, and also emerging competitors, seeking to capitalize on the growing needs for businesses and educators to transform their operations. For additional information, refer to \"Competition\" in Part I, Business.\nRegulation. Our business has developed in a relatively lightly regulated environment. For further discussion regarding regulatory issues which impact the Company, refer to \"Regulation\" in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements.\n30 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nKey Operating Data\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the VCP segment:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vonage Communications Platform </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenues per customer </td> <td>$ </td> <td>637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>447 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vonage Communications Platform revenue churn </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService revenues per customer. Service revenues per customer for a particular period is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenues for the period by the average number of customers over the number of months in the period. The average number of customers is the number of customers on the first day of the period, plus the number of customers on the last day of the period, divided by two. Service revenues excludes revenues from trading and auction customers. Service revenues per customer increased from $516 for 2020 to $637 for 2021 primarily driven by the Company's successful efforts to attract larger VCP customers, to expand services provided to our existing VCP customers, and to grow our API services especially high value services.\nVonage Communications Platform revenue churn. Vonage Communication Platform revenue churn is calculated by dividing the revenue from customers or customer locations that have been confirmed to be foregone during a period by the simple average of the total revenue from all customers in that period. Revenue for purposes of determining VCP revenue churn is service revenue excluding revenue from our trading and auction customers, and usage in excess of a customer's contracted service plan, regulatory fees charged to customers, and credits. The simple average of total revenue from all customers during the period is the total revenue as defined herein on the first day of the period, plus the total revenue as defined herein on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate business revenue churn differently, and their VCP revenue churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Vonage Communications Platform revenue churn decreased from 1.1% for 2020 and to 0.6% for 2021. Our revenue churn may fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, seasonality in certain customer's operations, loss of customers who are acquired, and competitive pressures including promotional pricing. We are continuing to invest in our overall quality of service which includes customer care headcount and systems, billing systems, on-boarding processes and self-service options to ensure we scale our processes to our growth and continue to improve the overall customer experience and as a result have seen improvement in churn associated with API services.\n31 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the Consumer segment:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average monthly revenues per subscriber line </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.04 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscriber lines (at period end) </td> <td>779,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>909,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,087,819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer churn </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage monthly revenues per subscriber line. Average monthly revenues per subscriber line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our revenues for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period, and dividing the result by the number of months in the period. The simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period, plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period, divided by two. Our average monthly revenues per subscriber line increased from $27.77 for 2020 to $28.50 for 2021 due primarily to the Company's ability to retain its more tenured customer.\nSubscriber lines. Our subscriber lines include, as of a particular date, all paid subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date. Our subscriber lines include fax lines, including fax lines bundled with subscriber lines in our small office home office calling plans and soft phones, but do not include our virtual phone numbers and toll free numbers, which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers. Subscriber lines decreased from 909,965 as of December 31, 2020 to 779,179 as of December 31, 2021, reflecting planned actions to enhance the profitability while managing the decline in the customer base.\nCustomer churn. Customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of customers that have terminated during a period by the simple average of number of customers in a given period. The simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period, plus the number of customers on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate customer churn differently, and their customer churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Customer churn decreased to 1.4% for 2021 from 1.7% for 2020. We maximize customer value by focusing marketing spend on higher return channels and away from assisted selling channels which had higher early life churn. We monitor customer churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction. Customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a lower churn rate than customers who have not. In addition, our customers who are international callers generally churn at a lower rate than customers who are domestic callers. Our customer churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, competitive pressures including promotional pricing targeting international long distance callers, marketplace perception of our services, and our ability to provide high quality customer care and network quality and add future innovative products and services. See the discussion above for detail regarding churn impacting our business customers.\n32 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of income for the periods indicated:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,409,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,247,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,189,346 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>694,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>511,084 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>335,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>342,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>363,111 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Engineering and development </td> <td>80,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,460 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>202,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,672 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>88,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,256 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>1,401,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,248,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,182,583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (Loss) from operations </td> <td>7,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(149) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,763 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Income (Expense): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>(28,348) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,160) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,821) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td>905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net </td> <td>(27,443) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,846) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,871) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(20,062) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,995) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,108) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit </td> <td>(4,435) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,217) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,626 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,497) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(36,212) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,482) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's discussion of the results of operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe Company reported loss before income taxes of $20,062 and $31,995 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to higher gross margin dollars of $20,095 driven by increased sales within the VCP platform primarily associated with the 42% growth in API services offset by higher operating expenses of $12,565 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to increased general and administrative expenses resulting from higher stock based compensation and acquisition related costs in the current year.\nThe Company reported net loss of $24,497 and $36,212, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The decrease in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 and loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 as discussed above. The tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by a permanent adjustment related to a limitation against the deductibility of officer's compensation, acquisition costs related to the proposed Ericsson transaction, and foreign nondeductible losses. In addition, a $6 million benefit was recorded for Research & Development Tax Credits in the United States and United Kingdom.\n33 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following graphs illustrate the composition of our Adjusted EBITDA with respect to each of our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA for Vonage Communications Platform has improved from losses of $56,968 for the years ended December 31, 2020, to income of $10,714 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This improvement in Vonage Communications Platform Adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to an increase in Vonage Communications Platform gross margin of $64,126 as the Company experience growth in API services as compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for Vonage Communications Platform was also positively impacted in the current year due to cost saving initiatives executed in the second half of 2020. The decline year over year of Adjusted EBITDA for Consumer is primarily driven by the decrease in subscriber lines year over year as further described below.\n34 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nConsolidated Gross Margin for the Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nWe calculate gross margin as total revenues less cost of service, which primarily consists of fees that we pay to third parties on an ongoing basis in order to provide our services and costs incurred when a customer first subscribes to our service. The following table presents total revenues, cost of revenues and the composition of gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change 2020 to 2021 </td> <td>% Change 2020 to 2021 </td> <td>$ Change 2019 to 2020 </td> <td>% Change 2019 to 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service, access and product revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,339,063 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,185,357 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,106,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>153,706 </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,885 </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>USF revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,952 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,577 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,375 </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,297) </td> <td> </td> <td>(24) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,409,015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,247,934 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,189,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,081 </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,588 </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service, access and product cost of revenues </td> <td>624,557 </td> <td> </td> <td>490,946 </td> <td> </td> <td>428,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,611 </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> <td>62,736 </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>USF cost of revenues </td> <td>69,952 </td> <td> </td> <td>62,577 </td> <td> </td> <td>82,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,375 </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(20,297) </td> <td> </td> <td>(24) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues (1)\n</td> <td>694,509 </td> <td> </td> <td>553,523 </td> <td> </td> <td>511,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140,986 </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td>42,439 </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin </td> <td>$ </td> <td>714,506 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>694,411 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>678,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,095 </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,149 </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes depreciation and amortization of $61,874, $51,408, and $38,167, respectively.\nTotal revenues and cost of revenues were impacted by the following trends and uncertainties:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020\nTotal revenues increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily due to VCP customer growth driving an increase in revenues of $205,068 as a result of increased usage of the Company's API product in the current year. This was partially offset by declining consumer revenues of $43,987 in connection with the continued decline of subscriber lines. The Company continues to expect that the Consumer portion of the Company's overall business will become less significant. The Company will focus its resources in an effort to increase market share in its VCP communications platforms.\nCost of revenues increased 25% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period driven by increased costs incurred in servicing our VCP customers of $140,942 due to the 42% growth in API services.\n35 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nVonage Communications Platform

The decrease in VCP service gross margin percentage is a result of greater proportion of lower margin services across our VCP segment during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenues from API services have grown to 56% of VCP revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 49% of VCP revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by growth in part of API products, particularly messaging, as the Company continues to strategically pursue new customer opportunities to drive product adoption across the VCP platform. Our gross margin percentage may continue to be impacted by changes in the mix of service offerings provided to our customers across our VCP segment.\n36 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nConsumer Gross

costs with the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact businesses across the globe.\n\u2022General and administrative expense increased 11%, primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense of

million donation to the Company's foundation in the current year and approximately $10 million in acquisition related costs associated with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Ericsson.

The year ended December 31, 2021 includes a permanent adjustment related to a limitation against the deductibility of officer's compensation, acquisition costs related to the proposed Ericsson transaction, and foreign nondeductible losses.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or net loss attributable to Vonage before income tax expense or benefit, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based expense, amortization of costs to implement cloud computing arrangements, acquisition related transaction and integration costs, organizational transformation costs, restructuring activities, and other non-recurring items. Organizational transformation in 2020 includes employee related exits including CEO succession, system change management, facility exit costs, and rebranding. Restructuring activities relate to the Company's business-wide optimization and alignment project initiated in 2020 which included employee related exits and further facility exit costs executed upon as part of the overall project. Other non-recurring items principally include certain litigation charges and other non-recurring project costs such as the review of the Consumer business and the business optimization project, both of which were initiated in 2020. This is also consistent with the measure used under our bank credit assessment. Our management and our Board of Directors utilize Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to our investors as a basis for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to that of other companies.\nOur reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated income before taxes is presented below:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,497) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(36,212) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,482) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td> </td> <td>4,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,626) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>28,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,821 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>88,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,256 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of costs to implement cloud computing arrangements </td> <td> </td> <td>3,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,362 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based expense </td> <td> </td> <td>79,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,242 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related transactions and integration costs </td> <td> </td> <td>10,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>701 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organizational transformation </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring activities </td> <td> </td> <td>2,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-recurring items </td> <td> </td> <td>4,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,289 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>197,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158,096 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n40 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had higher net cash from operations compared to the years ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to higher gross profit dollars during the current year. We expect to continue to balance efforts to grow our revenue with seeking to consistently achieve operating profitability. To grow our revenue, we continue to make investments in growth initiatives, marketing, application development, network quality and expansion, and customer care. We believe that cash flow from operations and cash on hand will fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change 2020 to 2021 </td> <td>$ Change 2019 to 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158,711 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,880 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,831 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,046) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(62,719) </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,723) </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,079) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,996) </td> <td> </td> <td>(644) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities </td> <td>(117,257) </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,850) </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,921) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106,407) </td> <td> </td> <td>11,071 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe following table describes the changes in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash items primarily due to increased gross margin driven by growth within VCP during the year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,951 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in working capital driven primarily by timing of vendor payments, prepayments for annual licenses and improvement in operating cash flows as a result of benefits under the CARES Act offset by declines in deferred revenue as customers shift from annual billings to more frequent billings\n</td> <td>29,880 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvesting Activities\nThe following table describes the changes in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in payments to acquire and develop software assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,139) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in payments related to capital expenditures </td> <td>1,575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash paid related to acquisitions of business </td> <td>(7,000) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase from proceeds on sale of intangible assets net of payments to acquire new patents on our developed technology </td> <td>568 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash used in investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,996) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nThe following table describes the changes in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increased repayments net of borrowings compared to the prior year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(80,000) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in proceeds received from exercise of stock options due to fewer exercises in 2021 </td> <td>(4,390) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in payments associated with taxes on share based compensation due to higher vesting and stock price in 2021 </td> <td>(22,017) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash used in financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(106,407) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n41 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nSources of Liquidity\nThe principal sources of liquidity are derived from available borrowings under our existing financing arrangements, existing cash on hand, and cash flows from operations. As described in Note 8, Long-Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist of its Convertible Senior Notes and the 2018 Credit Facility comprised of a $100,000 term note and a $500,000 revolving credit facility.\nUses of Liquidity\nThe Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources are generally for the purposes of operating activities, debt service obligations, restructuring initiatives, and capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditures were primarily for the implementation of software solutions and purchase of network equipment as we continue to expand our network. Our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $55,719, of which $46,979 was for software acquisition and development. The majority of these expenditures are comprised of investments in information technology and systems infrastructure, including an electronic data warehouse, online customer service, and customer management platforms for the Vonage Communications Platform. For 2022, we believe our capital and software expenditures will be approximately $65 million.\nAvailable Borrowings Under the 2018 Credit Facility\nWe maintain significant availability under our line of credit to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2021, amounts available under the 2018 Credit Facility totaled $369.5 million.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nConvertible Senior Notes. The company issued $345 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2024. As of December 31, 2021, interest associated with the convertible senior note is approximately $6,038 for 2022 through 2023 annually and $2,734 in 2024. See Note 8, Long-Term Debt in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2018 Credit Facility. The 2018 Credit Facility was entered in July 2018 consisting of a $100,000 term note and a $500,000 revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, the 2018 revolving credit facility balance was $130,500, matures on July 31, 2023 and interest associated with the outstanding debt is approximately $5,511 in 2022 and $3,648 in 2023, respectively. See Note 8, Long-Term Debt in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating Lease Obligations. At December 31, 2021, we had future commitments for office spaces leased in Holmdel, New Jersey for our headquarters, various other locations for field sales and administration offices in the United States and other countries, in Tel Aviv, Israel for application development, in London, United Kingdom for our UK offices, and for operating leases for co-location facilities mainly in the United States that accommodate a portion of our network equipment. As part of the Company's business optimization evaluation, the Company closed certain office locations worldwide and will lease agile workspaces when needed after the COVID-19 occupancy restrictions are lifted. As of December 31, 2021, operating lease obligations are approximately $11,825 in 2022, $11,089 in 2023, $7,193 in 2024, $7,404 in 2025, $6,431 in 2026, and $3,280 thereafter.\nPurchase obligations. The purchase obligations are primarily commitments to vendors who will provide license patents to us, provide web hosting service, provide electricity to our office, provide cloud-based data warehousing, provide software maintenance service, and provide insurance to us. In certain cases, we may terminate these arrangements early upon payment of specified fees. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented do not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes in our expected cash position. As of December 31, 2021, purchase obligations are approximately $29,208 in 2022, $7,894 in 2023, $2,414 in 2024, and $1,367 in 2025, respectively. See also Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n42 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nSUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those policies management believes are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, the Company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates:\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, including uncertainty in the economic environment due to the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience, available market information, appropriate valuation methodologies, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Estimates are used for such items as depreciable lives for long-lived assets including intangible assets, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts, convertible notes, and assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment.\nCOVID-19 has created and may continue to create uncertainty in customer payments, reduced usage, and issuance of customer credits to distressed customers served by certain product lines. As of the date of our consolidated financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to materially update our estimates or judgments. However, these estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, which may result in changes being recognized in our consolidated financial statements in future periods. In particular and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the assumptions and estimates associated with collectability assessment of revenue and credit losses of accounts receivable may have a material impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods, depending on the continued duration or degree of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which is further described in Note 4, Revenue Recognition to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe measure revenue based upon consideration specified by contracts with our customers. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligation under the contract is satisfied by transferring control over the product or service to the customer. We derive our revenues for our Consumer and Vonage Communications Platform segments primarily from the sale of our communication services and customer equipment as further described below. The majority of the Company's contracts with customers have a single performance obligation for service revenues. We recognize revenue with customers when control transfers, which occurs upon delivery of a service or product. For our VCP segment, the typical life of a service customer is seven years.\nService Revenues\nSubstantially all of our revenues are service revenues, which are derived from monthly subscription fees under usage based or pay-per-use type billing arrangements, and contract-based services plans. For consumer customers in the United States, we offer domestic and international rate plans, including a variety of residential plans and mobile plans. For business customers, we offer small and medium business, mid-market, and enterprise customers several service plans with different pricing structures and contractual requirements ranging in duration from month-to-month to three years. In addition, we provide managed equipment to business customers for a monthly fee. Customers also have the opportunity to purchase premium features for additional fees. We also derive service revenues from per minute fees for international calls if not covered under a plan, including calls made via applications for mobile devices and other stand-alone products, and for any calling minutes in excess of a customer's monthly plan limits. For a portion of our customers, monthly subscription fees are automatically charged to customers' credit cards, debit cards or ECP in advance and are recognized over the following month as service is provided.\n43 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nService revenue also includes supplying messaging (SMS and Voice) services to customers as part of our API offerings. Revenue is recognized in the period when messages are sent by the customer. We also transact with providers or bulk SMS aggregators and sell services to these customers who then onsell to their customers. Since the aggregator is our customer, revenue is recognized on a gross basis with related costs included in cost of revenues.\nIn the United States, we charge regulatory, compliance, E-911 and intellectual property-related recovery fees on a monthly basis to defray costs and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services. These charges, along with the remittance to the relevant government entity, are recorded on a gross basis. In addition, we charge customers USF fees from customers to recover our obligation to contribute to the fund, as allowed by the FCC. We recognize USF revenue on a gross basis and record the related fees in cost of revenues.\nCustomer Equipment and Shipping Revenues\nRevenues are generated from sales of customer equipment directly to customers for replacement devices, or for upgrading their device at the time of customer sign-up for which we charge an additional fee. In addition, customer equipment and shipping revenues include revenues from the sale of VoIP telephones in order to access our small and medium business services. Customer equipment and shipping revenues also include the fees that customers are charged for shipping their customer equipment to them.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had goodwill of $615,134 consisting of $164,356 associated with APIs through the acquisitions of Nexmo and TokBox and $450,778 associated with the Unified Communications and Contact Center Communications as a result of acquisitions of NVM, iCore, Simple Signal, Telesphere, and Vocalocity. The Company does not have any goodwill allocated to its Consumer segment as of December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company recognized intangible assets measured primarily based upon significant inputs that are not observable in the market and represent Level 3 measurements as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements.\nThe Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other to account for goodwill and intangible assets. The Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment on an annual basis on October 1st and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. The Company tests for goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available. With respect to the annual goodwill impairment test on October 1st, the Company identified the UC/CC and API reporting units which collectively represent the VCP segment as of that date.\nOn January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASC No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The guidance allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If determined to be necessary, the quantitative impairment test shall be used to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized (if any).\nThe Company performed a qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry and market events and circumstances, and the overall financial performance of its APIs reporting unit and its Unified Communications and Contact Center Communications reporting unit as of October 1st with respect to the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill attributed each of the reporting units was less than its carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment needed to be recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021. There were also no impairments recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe also perform a review of our purchased-intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of purchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If the useful life of the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There was no impairment of purchased-intangible assets identified for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\n44 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nValuation of Income Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. Our net deferred taxes primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLs, intangibles and prepaids. We are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs) prior to expiration. We periodically review this conclusion, which requires significant management judgment. If we are able to conclude in a future period that a future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized, we are required in that period to reduce the related valuation allowance with a corresponding decrease in income tax expense. This would result in a non-cash benefit to our net income in the period of the determination. In subsequent periods, we would expect to recognize income tax expense equal to our pre-tax income multiplied by our effective income tax rate, an expense that was not recognized prior to the reduction of the valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had NOLs for United States federal and state tax purposes, including those NOLs acquired as part of past business combinations, of $352,077 and $184,914, respectively, expiring at various times through 2037. In addition, we had Non-US NOLs of $170,366 primarily related to the United Kingdom which has no expiration date.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if we undergo an ownership change\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in our equity ownership over a three-year period, our ability to use our pre-change of control NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes against our post-change income may be limited. The Section 382 limitation is so as to limit the use of our pre-change NOLs to an amount that generally equals the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by a designated federal long-term tax-exempt rate. At December 31, 2021, there were no limitations on the use of our NOLs except for the NOLs of Vocalocity as of the date of acquisition for which the Company has reflected in the deferred tax asset.\nCapitalized Software\nThe Company capitalizes qualifying internal-use software development costs that are incurred during the application development stage. Capitalization is dependent on whether management with the relevant authority has authorized and committed to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 the Company capitalized $46,979, $41,840, and $28,488, respectively, related to the acquisition of software assets which was largely comprised of labor directly associated with internal-use projects.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquired businesses treated as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets acquired. Estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, and when appropriate, include assistance from independent third-party appraisal firms.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n45 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including the factors we describe under Item 1A - Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in connection with, the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereof. Components of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include:\n\u2022Overview\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Non-GAAP Measures\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Contractual Obligations\n\u2022Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOVERVIEW\nAt Vonage, our vision is to accelerate the world's ability to connect. We are observing a secular change in the way business is done, with a fundamental shift in how communications technologies are being leveraged in almost every industry. Through the Vonage Communications Platform, our strategy is to deliver a single leading cloud communications platform that powers our customers' and partners' global engagement solutions using our APIs, Unified Communications, and Contact Center innovations. We believe that the Vonage Communications Platform's products and services are well positioned to take advantage of emerging trends with sizable, growing total addressable markets as companies look to cloud-based communications solutions and API programming architectures as part of their digital transformation.\nOur business is organized under two reportable operating segments: Vonage Communications Platform and Consumer. The Vonage Communications Platform includes our Unified Communications, Contact Center Communications, and APIs service offerings and represents the Company's strategic business as the source of future growth. Our Consumer segment includes our communications solutions for residential customers based on our roots in providing VoIP communication services.\n29 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nImpact of COVID-19\nA novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, was first identified in China in December 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization. To date, COVID-19 has impacted nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns worldwide. The full impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and financial results has and will depend on various factors that continue to evolve, which we may not accurately predict. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments across the world have enacted measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus, including the practice of social distancing when engaging in authorized activities. While some of these restrictions have been lifted on a global scale, many regions, including the United States where Vonage is headquartered, are experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 variants. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, typical business travel remains at reduced levels to protect the health of our employees and to comply with local guidelines, and we have also continued modified usage of Vonage offices worldwide to comply with social distancing (including our corporate headquarters), all of which disrupt how we typically operate our business.\nCOVID-19 has impacted some of our customers more than others, including customers in the travel, hospitality, retail, and other industries where physical interaction is critical. We have experienced and expect that we will continue to experience slowdowns in bookings and customer payments, customer churn and reduced usage, and issuance of customer credits to distressed customers served by certain product lines in the Vonage Communications Platform. In addition, COVID-19 may have impacts on many additional aspects of our operations, directly and indirectly, including with respect to its impacts on customer behaviors, our business and our employees, and the market generally, and the scope and nature of these impacts continue to evolve each day.\nRecent Significant Events\nOn November 22, 2021, the Company, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ) (\"Ericsson\"), and Ericsson Muon Holding Inc., entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") providing for the acquisition of the Company by Ericsson for approximately $6.2 billion in cash. The proposed transaction received the required approval of the Company's stockholders on February 9, 2022 and is expected to be consummated during the first half of 2022 following the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions.\nOn October 18, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Jumper AI Pte. Ltd. for cash consideration of $7 million. The Company expects to allocate the purchase price primarily to developed technology and customer relationships. The Company may make additional payments of up to $9 million over the next two years subject to continuing employment of key individuals and achievement of certain financial targets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a new lease agreement to relocate its corporate headquarters to a new leased facility located in Holmdel, New Jersey. As a result, the Company expects to incur a charge associated with the abandonment of its former corporate headquarters in early 2022 upon successful relocation.\nTrends in Our Industry\nA number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements.\nCompetitive landscape. The business cloud communications markets and consumer services market in which we participate are highly competitive. We face competition from a broad set of companies, including (i) SaaS companies, CCaaS companies, other alternative communication providers, other providers of cloud communication services and (ii) traditional telephone, wireless service providers, cable companies, and alternative communications providers with consumer offerings. As the cloud communications market evolves, and the convergence of voice, video, messaging, mobility and data networking technologies accelerates, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete in the market, including companies that currently compete in other sectors, companies that serve consumers rather than business customers, or companies which expand their market presence to include cloud communications. Moreover, as businesses and educational institutions are quickly pivoting to cloud-based communications in light the increased need for remote work and remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are experiencing intense competition from our existing competitors, and also emerging competitors, seeking to capitalize on the growing needs for businesses and educators to transform their operations. For additional information, refer to \"Competition\" in Part I, Business.\nRegulation. Our business has developed in a relatively lightly regulated environment. For further discussion regarding regulatory issues which impact the Company, refer to \"Regulation\" in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements.\n30 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nKey Operating Data\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the VCP segment:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vonage Communications Platform </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenues per customer </td> <td>$ </td> <td>637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>447 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vonage Communications Platform revenue churn </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService revenues per customer. Service revenues per customer for a particular period is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenues for the period by the average number of customers over the number of months in the period. The average number of customers is the number of customers on the first day of the period, plus the number of customers on the last day of the period, divided by two. Service revenues excludes revenues from trading and auction customers. Service revenues per customer increased from $516 for 2020 to $637 for 2021 primarily driven by the Company's successful efforts to attract larger VCP customers, to expand services provided to our existing VCP customers, and to grow our API services especially high value services.\nVonage Communications Platform revenue churn. Vonage Communication Platform revenue churn is calculated by dividing the revenue from customers or customer locations that have been confirmed to be foregone during a period by the simple average of the total revenue from all customers in that period. Revenue for purposes of determining VCP revenue churn is service revenue excluding revenue from our trading and auction customers, and usage in excess of a customer's contracted service plan, regulatory fees charged to customers, and credits. The simple average of total revenue from all customers during the period is the total revenue as defined herein on the first day of the period, plus the total revenue as defined herein on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate business revenue churn differently, and their VCP revenue churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Vonage Communications Platform revenue churn decreased from 1.1% for 2020 and to 0.6% for 2021. Our revenue churn may fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, seasonality in certain customer's operations, loss of customers who are acquired, and competitive pressures including promotional pricing. We are continuing to invest in our overall quality of service which includes customer care headcount and systems, billing systems, on-boarding processes and self-service options to ensure we scale our processes to our growth and continue to improve the overall customer experience and as a result have seen improvement in churn associated with API services.\n31 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the Consumer segment:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average monthly revenues per subscriber line </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.04 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscriber lines (at period end) </td> <td>779,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>909,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,087,819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer churn </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage monthly revenues per subscriber line. Average monthly revenues per subscriber line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our revenues for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period, and dividing the result by the number of months in the period. The simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period, plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period, divided by two. Our average monthly revenues per subscriber line increased from $27.77 for 2020 to $28.50 for 2021 due primarily to the Company's ability to retain its more tenured customer.\nSubscriber lines. Our subscriber lines include, as of a particular date, all paid subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date. Our subscriber lines include fax lines, including fax lines bundled with subscriber lines in our small office home office calling plans and soft phones, but do not include our virtual phone numbers and toll free numbers, which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers. Subscriber lines decreased from 909,965 as of December 31, 2020 to 779,179 as of December 31, 2021, reflecting planned actions to enhance the profitability while managing the decline in the customer base.\nCustomer churn. Customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of customers that have terminated during a period by the simple average of number of customers in a given period. The simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period, plus the number of customers on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate customer churn differently, and their customer churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Customer churn decreased to 1.4% for 2021 from 1.7% for 2020. We maximize customer value by focusing marketing spend on higher return channels and away from assisted selling channels which had higher early life churn. We monitor customer churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction. Customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a lower churn rate than customers who have not. In addition, our customers who are international callers generally churn at a lower rate than customers who are domestic callers. Our customer churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, competitive pressures including promotional pricing targeting international long distance callers, marketplace perception of our services, and our ability to provide high quality customer care and network quality and add future innovative products and services. See the discussion above for detail regarding churn impacting our business customers.\n32 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of income for the periods indicated:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,409,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,247,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,189,346 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>694,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>511,084 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>335,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>342,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>363,111 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Engineering and development </td> <td>80,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,460 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>202,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,672 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>88,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,256 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>1,401,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,248,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,182,583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (Loss) from operations </td> <td>7,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(149) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,763 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Income (Expense): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>(28,348) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,160) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,821) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td>905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net </td> <td>(27,443) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,846) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,871) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(20,062) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,995) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,108) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit </td> <td>(4,435) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,217) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,626 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,497) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(36,212) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,482) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's discussion of the results of operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe Company reported loss before income taxes of $20,062 and $31,995 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to higher gross margin dollars of $20,095 driven by increased sales within the VCP platform primarily associated with the 42% growth in API services offset by higher operating expenses of $12,565 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to increased general and administrative expenses resulting from higher stock based compensation and acquisition related costs in the current year.\nThe Company reported net loss of $24,497 and $36,212, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The decrease in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 and loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 as discussed above. The tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by a permanent adjustment related to a limitation against the deductibility of officer's compensation, acquisition costs related to the proposed Ericsson transaction, and foreign nondeductible losses. In addition, a $6 million benefit was recorded for Research & Development Tax Credits in the United States and United Kingdom.\n33 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following graphs illustrate the composition of our Adjusted EBITDA with respect to each of our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA for Vonage Communications Platform has improved from losses of $56,968 for the years ended December 31, 2020, to income of $10,714 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This improvement in Vonage Communications Platform Adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to an increase in Vonage Communications Platform gross margin of $64,126 as the Company experience growth in API services as compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for Vonage Communications Platform was also positively impacted in the current year due to cost saving initiatives executed in the second half of 2020. The decline year over year of Adjusted EBITDA for Consumer is primarily driven by the decrease in subscriber lines year over year as further described below.\n34 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nConsolidated Gross Margin for the Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nWe calculate gross margin as total revenues less cost of service, which primarily consists of fees that we pay to third parties on an ongoing basis in order to provide our services and costs incurred when a customer first subscribes to our service.

The increase is primarily due to VCP customer growth driving an increase in revenues of $205,068 as a result of increased usage of the Company's API product in the current year. This was partially offset by declining consumer revenues of $43,987 in connection with the continued decline of subscriber lines. The Company continues to expect that the Consumer portion of the Company's overall business will become less significant. The Company will focus its resources in an effort to increase market share in its VCP communications platforms.\nCost of revenues increased 25% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period driven by increased costs incurred in servicing our VCP customers of $140,942 due to the 42% growth in API services.\n35 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nVonage Communications Platform

The decrease in VCP service gross margin percentage is a result of greater proportion of lower margin services across our VCP segment during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenues from API services have grown to 56% of VCP revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 49% of VCP revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by growth in part of API products, particularly messaging, as the Company continues to strategically pursue new customer opportunities to drive product adoption across the VCP platform. Our gross margin percentage may continue to be impacted by changes in the mix of service offerings provided to our customers across our VCP segment.\n36 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nConsumer Gross

costs with the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact businesses across the globe.\n\u2022General and administrative expense increased 11%, primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense of

million donation to the Company's foundation in the current year and approximately $10 million in acquisition related costs associated with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Ericsson.

The year ended December 31, 2021 includes a permanent adjustment related to a limitation against the deductibility of officer's compensation, acquisition costs related to the proposed Ericsson transaction, and foreign nondeductible losses.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or net loss attributable to Vonage before income tax expense or benefit, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based expense, amortization of costs to implement cloud computing arrangements, acquisition related transaction and integration costs, organizational transformation costs, restructuring activities, and other non-recurring items. Organizational transformation in 2020 includes employee related exits including CEO succession, system change management, facility exit costs, and rebranding. Restructuring activities relate to the Company's business-wide optimization and alignment project initiated in 2020 which included employee related exits and further facility exit costs executed upon as part of the overall project. Other non-recurring items principally include certain litigation charges and other non-recurring project costs such as the review of the Consumer business and the business optimization project, both of which were initiated in 2020. This is also consistent with the measure used under our bank credit assessment. Our management and our Board of Directors utilize Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to our investors as a basis for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to that of other companies.\nOur reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated income before taxes is presented below:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,497) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(36,212) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,482) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td> </td> <td>4,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,626) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>28,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,821 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>88,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,256 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of costs to implement cloud computing arrangements </td> <td> </td> <td>3,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,362 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based expense </td> <td> </td> <td>79,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,242 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related transactions and integration costs </td> <td> </td> <td>10,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>701 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organizational transformation </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring activities </td> <td> </td> <td>2,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-recurring items </td> <td> </td> <td>4,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,289 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>197,570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158,096 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n40 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had higher net cash from operations compared to the years ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to higher gross profit dollars during the current year. We expect to continue to balance efforts to grow our revenue with seeking to consistently achieve operating profitability. To grow our revenue, we continue to make investments in growth initiatives, marketing, application development, network quality and expansion, and customer care. We believe that cash flow from operations and cash on hand will fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change 2020 to 2021 </td> <td>$ Change 2019 to 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158,711 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,880 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,831 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,046) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(62,719) </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,723) </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,079) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,996) </td> <td> </td> <td>(644) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities </td> <td>(117,257) </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,850) </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,921) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106,407) </td> <td> </td> <td>11,071 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe following table describes the changes in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash items primarily due to increased gross margin driven by growth within VCP during the year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,951 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in working capital driven primarily by timing of vendor payments, prepayments for annual licenses and improvement in operating cash flows as a result of benefits under the CARES Act offset by declines in deferred revenue as customers shift from annual billings to more frequent billings\n</td> <td>29,880 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvesting Activities\nThe following table describes the changes in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in payments to acquire and develop software assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,139) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in payments related to capital expenditures </td> <td>1,575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash paid related to acquisitions of business </td> <td>(7,000) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase from proceeds on sale of intangible assets net of payments to acquire new patents on our developed technology </td> <td>568 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash used in investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,996) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities\nThe following table describes the changes in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increased repayments net of borrowings compared to the prior year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(80,000) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in proceeds received from exercise of stock options due to fewer exercises in 2021 </td> <td>(4,390) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in payments associated with taxes on share based compensation due to higher vesting and stock price in 2021 </td> <td>(22,017) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash used in financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(106,407) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n41 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nSources of Liquidity\nThe principal sources of liquidity are derived from available borrowings under our existing financing arrangements, existing cash on hand, and cash flows from operations. As described in Note 8, Long-Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist of its Convertible Senior Notes and the 2018 Credit Facility comprised of a $100,000 term note and a $500,000 revolving credit facility.\nUses of Liquidity\nThe Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources are generally for the purposes of operating activities, debt service obligations, restructuring initiatives, and capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditures were primarily for the implementation of software solutions and purchase of network equipment as we continue to expand our network. Our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $55,719, of which $46,979 was for software acquisition and development. The majority of these expenditures are comprised of investments in information technology and systems infrastructure, including an electronic data warehouse, online customer service, and customer management platforms for the Vonage Communications Platform. For 2022, we believe our capital and software expenditures will be approximately $65 million.\nAvailable Borrowings Under the 2018 Credit Facility\nWe maintain significant availability under our line of credit to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2021, amounts available under the 2018 Credit Facility totaled $369.5 million.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nConvertible Senior Notes. The company issued $345 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2024. As of December 31, 2021, interest associated with the convertible senior note is approximately $6,038 for 2022 through 2023 annually and $2,734 in 2024. See Note 8, Long-Term Debt in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2018 Credit Facility. The 2018 Credit Facility was entered in July 2018 consisting of a $100,000 term note and a $500,000 revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, the 2018 revolving credit facility balance was $130,500, matures on July 31, 2023 and interest associated with the outstanding debt is approximately $5,511 in 2022 and $3,648 in 2023, respectively. See Note 8, Long-Term Debt in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating Lease Obligations. At December 31, 2021, we had future commitments for office spaces leased in Holmdel, New Jersey for our headquarters, various other locations for field sales and administration offices in the United States and other countries, in Tel Aviv, Israel for application development, in London, United Kingdom for our UK offices, and for operating leases for co-location facilities mainly in the United States that accommodate a portion of our network equipment. As part of the Company's business optimization evaluation, the Company closed certain office locations worldwide and will lease agile workspaces when needed after the COVID-19 occupancy restrictions are lifted. As of December 31, 2021, operating lease obligations are approximately $11,825 in 2022, $11,089 in 2023, $7,193 in 2024, $7,404 in 2025, $6,431 in 2026, and $3,280 thereafter.\nPurchase obligations. The purchase obligations are primarily commitments to vendors who will provide license patents to us, provide web hosting service, provide electricity to our office, provide cloud-based data warehousing, provide software maintenance service, and provide insurance to us. In certain cases, we may terminate these arrangements early upon payment of specified fees. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented do not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes in our expected cash position. As of December 31, 2021, purchase obligations are approximately $29,208 in 2022, $7,894 in 2023, $2,414 in 2024, and $1,367 in 2025, respectively. See also Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n42 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nSUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those policies management believes are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, the Company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates:\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, including uncertainty in the economic environment due to the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience, available market information, appropriate valuation methodologies, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Estimates are used for such items as depreciable lives for long-lived assets including intangible assets, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts, convertible notes, and assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment.\nCOVID-19 has created and may continue to create uncertainty in customer payments, reduced usage, and issuance of customer credits to distressed customers served by certain product lines. As of the date of our consolidated financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to materially update our estimates or judgments. However, these estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, which may result in changes being recognized in our consolidated financial statements in future periods. In particular and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the assumptions and estimates associated with collectability assessment of revenue and credit losses of accounts receivable may have a material impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods, depending on the continued duration or degree of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which is further described in Note 4, Revenue Recognition to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe measure revenue based upon consideration specified by contracts with our customers. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligation under the contract is satisfied by transferring control over the product or service to the customer. We derive our revenues for our Consumer and Vonage Communications Platform segments primarily from the sale of our communication services and customer equipment as further described below. The majority of the Company's contracts with customers have a single performance obligation for service revenues. We recognize revenue with customers when control transfers, which occurs upon delivery of a service or product. For our VCP segment, the typical life of a service customer is seven years.\nService Revenues\nSubstantially all of our revenues are service revenues, which are derived from monthly subscription fees under usage based or pay-per-use type billing arrangements, and contract-based services plans. For consumer customers in the United States, we offer domestic and international rate plans, including a variety of residential plans and mobile plans. For business customers, we offer small and medium business, mid-market, and enterprise customers several service plans with different pricing structures and contractual requirements ranging in duration from month-to-month to three years. In addition, we provide managed equipment to business customers for a monthly fee. Customers also have the opportunity to purchase premium features for additional fees. We also derive service revenues from per minute fees for international calls if not covered under a plan, including calls made via applications for mobile devices and other stand-alone products, and for any calling minutes in excess of a customer's monthly plan limits. For a portion of our customers, monthly subscription fees are automatically charged to customers' credit cards, debit cards or ECP in advance and are recognized over the following month as service is provided.\n43 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nService revenue also includes supplying messaging (SMS and Voice) services to customers as part of our API offerings. Revenue is recognized in the period when messages are sent by the customer. We also transact with providers or bulk SMS aggregators and sell services to these customers who then onsell to their customers. Since the aggregator is our customer, revenue is recognized on a gross basis with related costs included in cost of revenues.\nIn the United States, we charge regulatory, compliance, E-911 and intellectual property-related recovery fees on a monthly basis to defray costs and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services. These charges, along with the remittance to the relevant government entity, are recorded on a gross basis. In addition, we charge customers USF fees from customers to recover our obligation to contribute to the fund, as allowed by the FCC. We recognize USF revenue on a gross basis and record the related fees in cost of revenues.\nCustomer Equipment and Shipping Revenues\nRevenues are generated from sales of customer equipment directly to customers for replacement devices, or for upgrading their device at the time of customer sign-up for which we charge an additional fee. In addition, customer equipment and shipping revenues include revenues from the sale of VoIP telephones in order to access our small and medium business services. Customer equipment and shipping revenues also include the fees that customers are charged for shipping their customer equipment to them.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had goodwill of $615,134 consisting of $164,356 associated with APIs through the acquisitions of Nexmo and TokBox and $450,778 associated with the Unified Communications and Contact Center Communications as a result of acquisitions of NVM, iCore, Simple Signal, Telesphere, and Vocalocity. The Company does not have any goodwill allocated to its Consumer segment as of December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company recognized intangible assets measured primarily based upon significant inputs that are not observable in the market and represent Level 3 measurements as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements.\nThe Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other to account for goodwill and intangible assets. The Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment on an annual basis on October 1st and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. The Company tests for goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available. With respect to the annual goodwill impairment test on October 1st, the Company identified the UC/CC and API reporting units which collectively represent the VCP segment as of that date.\nOn January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASC No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The guidance allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If determined to be necessary, the quantitative impairment test shall be used to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized (if any).\nThe Company performed a qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry and market events and circumstances, and the overall financial performance of its APIs reporting unit and its Unified Communications and Contact Center Communications reporting unit as of October 1st with respect to the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill attributed each of the reporting units was less than its carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment needed to be recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021. There were also no impairments recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe also perform a review of our purchased-intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of purchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If the useful life of the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There was no impairment of purchased-intangible assets identified for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\n44 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nValuation of Income Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. Our net deferred taxes primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLs, intangibles and prepaids. We are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs) prior to expiration. We periodically review this conclusion, which requires significant management judgment. If we are able to conclude in a future period that a future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized, we are required in that period to reduce the related valuation allowance with a corresponding decrease in income tax expense. This would result in a non-cash benefit to our net income in the period of the determination. In subsequent periods, we would expect to recognize income tax expense equal to our pre-tax income multiplied by our effective income tax rate, an expense that was not recognized prior to the reduction of the valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had NOLs for United States federal and state tax purposes, including those NOLs acquired as part of past business combinations, of $352,077 and $184,914, respectively, expiring at various times through 2037. In addition, we had Non-US NOLs of $170,366 primarily related to the United Kingdom which has no expiration date.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if we undergo an ownership change\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in our equity ownership over a three-year period, our ability to use our pre-change of control NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes against our post-change income may be limited. The Section 382 limitation is so as to limit the use of our pre-change NOLs to an amount that generally equals the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by a designated federal long-term tax-exempt rate. At December 31, 2021, there were no limitations on the use of our NOLs except for the NOLs of Vocalocity as of the date of acquisition for which the Company has reflected in the deferred tax asset.\nCapitalized Software\nThe Company capitalizes qualifying internal-use software development costs that are incurred during the application development stage. Capitalization is dependent on whether management with the relevant authority has authorized and committed to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 the Company capitalized $46,979, $41,840, and $28,488, respectively, related to the acquisition of software assets which was largely comprised of labor directly associated with internal-use projects.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquired businesses treated as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets acquired. Estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, and when appropriate, include assistance from independent third-party appraisal firms.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n45 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\n ", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including the factors we describe under Item 1A - Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in connection with, the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereof. Components of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include:\n\u2022Overview\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Non-GAAP Measures\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Contractual Obligations\n\u2022Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOVERVIEW\nAt Vonage, our vision is to accelerate the world's ability to connect. We are observing a secular change in the way business is done, with a fundamental shift in how communications technologies are being leveraged in almost every industry. Through the Vonage Communications Platform, our strategy is to deliver a single leading cloud communications platform that powers our customers' and partners' global engagement solutions using our APIs, Unified Communications, and Contact Center innovations. We believe that the Vonage Communications Platform's products and services are well positioned to take advantage of emerging trends with sizable, growing total addressable markets as companies look to cloud-based communications solutions and API programming architectures as part of their digital transformation.\nOur business is organized under two reportable operating segments: Vonage Communications Platform and Consumer. The Vonage Communications Platform includes our Unified Communications, Contact Center Communications, and APIs service offerings and represents the Company's strategic business as the source of future growth. Our Consumer segment includes our communications solutions for residential customers based on our roots in providing VoIP communication services.\n29 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nImpact of COVID-19\nA novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, was first identified in China in December 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization. To date, COVID-19 has impacted nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns worldwide. The full impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and financial results has and will depend on various factors that continue to evolve, which we may not accurately predict. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments across the world have enacted measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus, including the practice of social distancing when engaging in authorized activities. While some of these restrictions have been lifted on a global scale, many regions, including the United States where Vonage is headquartered, are experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 variants. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, typical business travel remains at reduced levels to protect the health of our employees and to comply with local guidelines, and we have also continued modified usage of Vonage offices worldwide to comply with social distancing (including our corporate headquarters), all of which disrupt how we typically operate our business.\nCOVID-19 has impacted some of our customers more than others, including customers in the travel, hospitality, retail, and other industries where physical interaction is critical. We have experienced and expect that we will continue to experience slowdowns in bookings and customer payments, customer churn and reduced usage, and issuance of customer credits to distressed customers served by certain product lines in the Vonage Communications Platform. In addition, COVID-19 may have impacts on many additional aspects of our operations, directly and indirectly, including with respect to its impacts on customer behaviors, our business and our employees, and the market generally, and the scope and nature of these impacts continue to evolve each day.\nRecent Significant Events\nOn November 22, 2021, the Company, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ) (\"Ericsson\"), and Ericsson Muon Holding Inc., entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") providing for the acquisition of the Company by Ericsson for approximately $6.2 billion in cash. The proposed transaction received the required approval of the Company's stockholders on February 9, 2022 and is expected to be consummated during the first half of 2022 following the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions.\nOn October 18, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Jumper AI Pte. Ltd. for cash consideration of $7 million. The Company expects to allocate the purchase price primarily to developed technology and customer relationships. The Company may make additional payments of up to $9 million over the next two years subject to continuing employment of key individuals and achievement of certain financial targets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a new lease agreement to relocate its corporate headquarters to a new leased facility located in Holmdel, New Jersey. As a result, the Company expects to incur a charge associated with the abandonment of its former corporate headquarters in early 2022 upon successful relocation.\nTrends in Our Industry\nA number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements.\nCompetitive landscape. The business cloud communications markets and consumer services market in which we participate are highly competitive. We face competition from a broad set of companies, including (i) SaaS companies, CCaaS companies, other alternative communication providers, other providers of cloud communication services and (ii) traditional telephone, wireless service providers, cable companies, and alternative communications providers with consumer offerings. As the cloud communications market evolves, and the convergence of voice, video, messaging, mobility and data networking technologies accelerates, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete in the market, including companies that currently compete in other sectors, companies that serve consumers rather than business customers, or companies which expand their market presence to include cloud communications. Moreover, as businesses and educational institutions are quickly pivoting to cloud-based communications in light the increased need for remote work and remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are experiencing intense competition from our existing competitors, and also emerging competitors, seeking to capitalize on the growing needs for businesses and educators to transform their operations. For additional information, refer to \"Competition\" in Part I, Business.\nRegulation. Our business has developed in a relatively lightly regulated environment. For further discussion regarding regulatory issues which impact the Company, refer to \"Regulation\" in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements.\n30 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nKey Operating Data\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the VCP segment:\n\nService revenues per customer. Service revenues per customer for a particular period is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenues for the period by the average number of customers over the number of months in the period. The average number of customers is the number of customers on the first day of the period, plus the number of customers on the last day of the period, divided by two. Service revenues excludes revenues from trading and auction customers. Service revenues per customer increased from $516 for 2020 to $637 for 2021 primarily driven by the Company's successful efforts to attract larger VCP customers, to expand services provided to our existing VCP customers, and to grow our API services especially high value services.\nVonage Communications Platform revenue churn. Vonage Communication Platform revenue churn is calculated by dividing the revenue from customers or customer locations that have been confirmed to be foregone during a period by the simple average of the total revenue from all customers in that period. Revenue for purposes of determining VCP revenue churn is service revenue excluding revenue from our trading and auction customers, and usage in excess of a customer's contracted service plan, regulatory fees charged to customers, and credits. The simple average of total revenue from all customers during the period is the total revenue as defined herein on the first day of the period, plus the total revenue as defined herein on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate business revenue churn differently, and their VCP revenue churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Vonage Communications Platform revenue churn decreased from 1.1% for 2020 and to 0.6% for 2021. Our revenue churn may fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, seasonality in certain customer's operations, loss of customers who are acquired, and competitive pressures including promotional pricing. We are continuing to invest in our overall quality of service which includes customer care headcount and systems, billing systems, on-boarding processes and self-service options to ensure we scale our processes to our growth and continue to improve the overall customer experience and as a result have seen improvement in churn associated with API services.\n31 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nThe table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of the Consumer segment:\n\nAverage monthly revenues per subscriber line. Average monthly revenues per subscriber line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our revenues for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period, and dividing the result by the number of months in the period. The simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period, plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period, divided by two. Our average monthly revenues per subscriber line increased from $27.77 for 2020 to $28.50 for 2021 due primarily to the Company's ability to retain its more tenured customer.\nSubscriber lines. Our subscriber lines include, as of a particular date, all paid subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date. Our subscriber lines include fax lines, including fax lines bundled with subscriber lines in our small office home office calling plans and soft phones, but do not include our virtual phone numbers and toll free numbers, which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers. Subscriber lines decreased from 909,965 as of December 31, 2020 to 779,179 as of December 31, 2021, reflecting planned actions to enhance the profitability while managing the decline in the customer base.\nCustomer churn. Customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of customers that have terminated during a period by the simple average of number of customers in a given period. The simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period, plus the number of customers on the last day of the period, divided by two. Terminations, as used in the calculation of churn statistics, do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first month after activation. Other companies may calculate customer churn differently, and their customer churn data may not be directly comparable to ours. Customer churn decreased to 1.4% for 2021 from 1.7% for 2020. We maximize customer value by focusing marketing spend on higher return channels and away from assisted selling channels which had higher early life churn. We monitor customer churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction. Customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a lower churn rate than customers who have not. In addition, our customers who are international callers generally churn at a lower rate than customers who are domestic callers. Our customer churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions, competitive pressures including promotional pricing targeting international long distance callers, marketplace perception of our services, and our ability to provide high quality customer care and network quality and add future innovative products and services. See the discussion above for detail regarding churn impacting our business customers.\n32 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of income for the periods indicated:\n\nManagement's discussion of the results of operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe Company reported loss before income taxes of $20,062 and $31,995 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to higher gross margin dollars of $20,095 driven by increased sales within the VCP platform primarily associated with the 42% growth in API services offset by higher operating expenses of $12,565 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to increased general and administrative expenses resulting from higher stock based compensation and acquisition related costs in the current year.\nThe Company reported net loss of $24,497 and $36,212, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The decrease in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 and loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 as discussed above. The tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by a permanent adjustment related to a limitation against the deductibility of officer's compensation, acquisition costs related to the proposed Ericsson transaction, and foreign nondeductible losses. In addition, a $6 million benefit was recorded for Research & Development Tax Credits in the United States and United Kingdom.\n33 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following graphs illustrate the composition of our Adjusted EBITDA with respect to each of our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA for Vonage Communications Platform has improved from losses of $56,968 for the years ended December 31, 2020, to income of $10,714 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This improvement in Vonage Communications Platform Adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to an increase in Vonage Communications Platform gross margin of $64,126 as the Company experience growth in API services as compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for Vonage Communications Platform was also positively impacted in the current year due to cost saving initiatives executed in the second half of 2020. The decline year over year of Adjusted EBITDA for Consumer is primarily driven by the decrease in subscriber lines year over year as further described below.\n34 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nConsolidated Gross Margin for the Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nWe calculate gross margin as total revenues less cost of service, which primarily consists of fees that we pay to third parties on an ongoing basis in order to provide our services and costs incurred when a customer first subscribes to our service. The following table presents total revenues, cost of revenues and the composition of gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n\n(1) Excludes depreciation and amortization of $61,874, $51,408, and $38,167, respectively.\nTotal revenues and cost of revenues were impacted by the following trends and uncertainties:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020\nTotal revenues increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily due to VCP customer growth driving an increase in revenues of $205,068 as a result of increased usage of the Company's API product in the current year. This was partially offset by declining consumer revenues of $43,987 in connection with the continued decline of subscriber lines. The Company continues to expect that the Consumer portion of the Company's overall business will become less significant. The Company will focus its resources in an effort to increase market share in its VCP communications platforms.\nCost of revenues increased 25% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period driven by increased costs incurred in servicing our VCP customers of $140,942 due to the 42% growth in API services.\n35 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nVonage Communications Platform Gross Margin for the Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019\n\n(1) Includes customer premise equipment, access, and shipping and handling.\n(2) Excludes depreciation and amortization of $60,966, $47,701, and $33,484, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table describes the increase in Vonage Communications Platform gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\nVonage Communications Platform service gross margin percentage decreased to 48.0% for the year December 31, 2021 from 51.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in VCP service gross margin percentage is a result of greater proportion of lower margin services across our VCP segment during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenues from API services have grown to 56% of VCP revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 49% of VCP revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by growth in part of API products, particularly messaging, as the Company continues to strategically pursue new customer opportunities to drive product adoption across the VCP platform. Our gross margin percentage may continue to be impacted by changes in the mix of service offerings provided to our customers across our VCP segment.\n36 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nConsumer Gross Margin for the Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019\n\n(1) Includes customer premise equipment, and shipping and handling.\n(2) Excludes depreciation and amortization of $908, $3,707, and $4,683, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table describes the decrease in Consumer gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\nConsumer service gross margin percentage decreased to 87.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 88.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to slightly higher international and domestic termination rates.\n37 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nOther Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents our other operating expenses during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020\nTotal other operating expenses increased by $12,565 during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Sales and marketing expense decreased 2%, primarily due to continued reductions in travel associated costs with the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact businesses across the globe.\n\u2022General and administrative expense increased 11%, primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense of approximately $10 million due in part to a modification of certain awards which was made as part of strategies implemented to mitigate the impact of 280G of the IRS Code for certain individuals, a $2 million donation to the Company's foundation in the current year and approximately $10 million in acquisition related costs associated with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Ericsson. These were partially offset by decreased employee costs as the Company has begun to realize benefits associated with the cost saving initiatives executed upon in the prior year and significantly lower restructuring charges in 2021.\n38 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nOther Income (Expense)\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020\nInterest expense. The interest expense decreased 12%, was mainly due to lower interest expense due to lower principal balances on our 2018 Credit Facility.\nIncome Taxes\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020\nWe recognize income taxes equal to pre-tax income multiplied by our annual effective income tax rate. In addition, adjustments are recorded for discrete period items and changes to our state effective tax rate which can cause the rate to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nThe increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily due to an increase in permanent items related to limitations on executive compensation, the inclusion of foreign income in the U.S. due to foreign disregarded entities, and limitation on foreign losses. The year ended December 31, 2021 includes a permanent adjustment related to a limitation against the deductibility of officer's compensation, acquisition costs related to the proposed Ericsson transaction, and foreign nondeductible losses. In addition, a $6 million benefit was recorded for Research & Development Tax Credits in the United States and United Kingdom.\n39 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nNON-GAAP METRICS\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used as the measure of profit or loss for our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or net loss attributable to Vonage before income tax expense or benefit, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based expense, amortization of costs to implement cloud computing arrangements, acquisition related transaction and integration costs, organizational transformation costs, restructuring activities, and other non-recurring items. Organizational transformation in 2020 includes employee related exits including CEO succession, system change management, facility exit costs, and rebranding. Restructuring activities relate to the Company's business-wide optimization and alignment project initiated in 2020 which included employee related exits and further facility exit costs executed upon as part of the overall project. Other non-recurring items principally include certain litigation charges and other non-recurring project costs such as the review of the Consumer business and the business optimization project, both of which were initiated in 2020. This is also consistent with the measure used under our bank credit assessment. Our management and our Board of Directors utilize Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to our investors as a basis for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to that of other companies.\nOur reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated income before taxes is presented below:\n\n40 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had higher net cash from operations compared to the years ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to higher gross profit dollars during the current year. We expect to continue to balance efforts to grow our revenue with seeking to consistently achieve operating profitability. To grow our revenue, we continue to make investments in growth initiatives, marketing, application development, network quality and expansion, and customer care. We believe that cash flow from operations and cash on hand will fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nOperating Activities\nThe following table describes the changes in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\nInvesting Activities\nThe following table describes the changes in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\nFinancing Activities\nThe following table describes the changes in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\n41 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nSources of Liquidity\nThe principal sources of liquidity are derived from available borrowings under our existing financing arrangements, existing cash on hand, and cash flows from operations. As described in Note 8, Long-Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist of its Convertible Senior Notes and the 2018 Credit Facility comprised of a $100,000 term note and a $500,000 revolving credit facility.\nUses of Liquidity\nThe Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources are generally for the purposes of operating activities, debt service obligations, restructuring initiatives, and capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditures were primarily for the implementation of software solutions and purchase of network equipment as we continue to expand our network. Our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $55,719, of which $46,979 was for software acquisition and development. The majority of these expenditures are comprised of investments in information technology and systems infrastructure, including an electronic data warehouse, online customer service, and customer management platforms for the Vonage Communications Platform. For 2022, we believe our capital and software expenditures will be approximately $65 million.\nAvailable Borrowings Under the 2018 Credit Facility\nWe maintain significant availability under our line of credit to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2021, amounts available under the 2018 Credit Facility totaled $369.5 million.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nConvertible Senior Notes. The company issued $345 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2024. As of December 31, 2021, interest associated with the convertible senior note is approximately $6,038 for 2022 through 2023 annually and $2,734 in 2024. See Note 8, Long-Term Debt in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2018 Credit Facility. The 2018 Credit Facility was entered in July 2018 consisting of a $100,000 term note and a $500,000 revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, the 2018 revolving credit facility balance was $130,500, matures on July 31, 2023 and interest associated with the outstanding debt is approximately $5,511 in 2022 and $3,648 in 2023, respectively. See Note 8, Long-Term Debt in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating Lease Obligations. At December 31, 2021, we had future commitments for office spaces leased in Holmdel, New Jersey for our headquarters, various other locations for field sales and administration offices in the United States and other countries, in Tel Aviv, Israel for application development, in London, United Kingdom for our UK offices, and for operating leases for co-location facilities mainly in the United States that accommodate a portion of our network equipment. As part of the Company's business optimization evaluation, the Company closed certain office locations worldwide and will lease agile workspaces when needed after the COVID-19 occupancy restrictions are lifted. As of December 31, 2021, operating lease obligations are approximately $11,825 in 2022, $11,089 in 2023, $7,193 in 2024, $7,404 in 2025, $6,431 in 2026, and $3,280 thereafter.\nPurchase obligations. The purchase obligations are primarily commitments to vendors who will provide license patents to us, provide web hosting service, provide electricity to our office, provide cloud-based data warehousing, provide software maintenance service, and provide insurance to us. In certain cases, we may terminate these arrangements early upon payment of specified fees. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented do not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes in our expected cash position. As of December 31, 2021, purchase obligations are approximately $29,208 in 2022, $7,894 in 2023, $2,414 in 2024, and $1,367 in 2025, respectively. See also Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n42 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nSUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those policies management believes are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, the Company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates:\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, including uncertainty in the economic environment due to the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience, available market information, appropriate valuation methodologies, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Estimates are used for such items as depreciable lives for long-lived assets including intangible assets, tax provisions, uncollectible accounts, convertible notes, and assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment.\nCOVID-19 has created and may continue to create uncertainty in customer payments, reduced usage, and issuance of customer credits to distressed customers served by certain product lines. As of the date of our consolidated financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to materially update our estimates or judgments. However, these estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, which may result in changes being recognized in our consolidated financial statements in future periods. In particular and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the assumptions and estimates associated with collectability assessment of revenue and credit losses of accounts receivable may have a material impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods, depending on the continued duration or degree of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which is further described in Note 4, Revenue Recognition to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe measure revenue based upon consideration specified by contracts with our customers. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligation under the contract is satisfied by transferring control over the product or service to the customer. We derive our revenues for our Consumer and Vonage Communications Platform segments primarily from the sale of our communication services and customer equipment as further described below. The majority of the Company's contracts with customers have a single performance obligation for service revenues. We recognize revenue with customers when control transfers, which occurs upon delivery of a service or product. For our VCP segment, the typical life of a service customer is seven years.\nService Revenues\nSubstantially all of our revenues are service revenues, which are derived from monthly subscription fees under usage based or pay-per-use type billing arrangements, and contract-based services plans. For consumer customers in the United States, we offer domestic and international rate plans, including a variety of residential plans and mobile plans. For business customers, we offer small and medium business, mid-market, and enterprise customers several service plans with different pricing structures and contractual requirements ranging in duration from month-to-month to three years. In addition, we provide managed equipment to business customers for a monthly fee. Customers also have the opportunity to purchase premium features for additional fees. We also derive service revenues from per minute fees for international calls if not covered under a plan, including calls made via applications for mobile devices and other stand-alone products, and for any calling minutes in excess of a customer's monthly plan limits. For a portion of our customers, monthly subscription fees are automatically charged to customers' credit cards, debit cards or ECP in advance and are recognized over the following month as service is provided.\n43 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nService revenue also includes supplying messaging (SMS and Voice) services to customers as part of our API offerings. Revenue is recognized in the period when messages are sent by the customer. We also transact with providers or bulk SMS aggregators and sell services to these customers who then onsell to their customers. Since the aggregator is our customer, revenue is recognized on a gross basis with related costs included in cost of revenues.\nIn the United States, we charge regulatory, compliance, E-911 and intellectual property-related recovery fees on a monthly basis to defray costs and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services. These charges, along with the remittance to the relevant government entity, are recorded on a gross basis. In addition, we charge customers USF fees from customers to recover our obligation to contribute to the fund, as allowed by the FCC. We recognize USF revenue on a gross basis and record the related fees in cost of revenues.\nCustomer Equipment and Shipping Revenues\nRevenues are generated from sales of customer equipment directly to customers for replacement devices, or for upgrading their device at the time of customer sign-up for which we charge an additional fee. In addition, customer equipment and shipping revenues include revenues from the sale of VoIP telephones in order to access our small and medium business services. Customer equipment and shipping revenues also include the fees that customers are charged for shipping their customer equipment to them.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had goodwill of $615,134 consisting of $164,356 associated with APIs through the acquisitions of Nexmo and TokBox and $450,778 associated with the Unified Communications and Contact Center Communications as a result of acquisitions of NVM, iCore, Simple Signal, Telesphere, and Vocalocity. The Company does not have any goodwill allocated to its Consumer segment as of December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company recognized intangible assets measured primarily based upon significant inputs that are not observable in the market and represent Level 3 measurements as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements.\nThe Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations and ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other to account for goodwill and intangible assets. The Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment on an annual basis on October 1st and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. The Company tests for goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available. With respect to the annual goodwill impairment test on October 1st, the Company identified the UC/CC and API reporting units which collectively represent the VCP segment as of that date.\nOn January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASC No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The guidance allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If determined to be necessary, the quantitative impairment test shall be used to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized (if any).\nThe Company performed a qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry and market events and circumstances, and the overall financial performance of its APIs reporting unit and its Unified Communications and Contact Center Communications reporting unit as of October 1st with respect to the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill attributed each of the reporting units was less than its carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment needed to be recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021. There were also no impairments recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe also perform a review of our purchased-intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of purchased-intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If the useful life of the asset is shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. There was no impairment of purchased-intangible assets identified for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\n44 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nValuation of Income Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. Our net deferred taxes primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLs, intangibles and prepaids. We are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs) prior to expiration. We periodically review this conclusion, which requires significant management judgment. If we are able to conclude in a future period that a future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized, we are required in that period to reduce the related valuation allowance with a corresponding decrease in income tax expense. This would result in a non-cash benefit to our net income in the period of the determination. In subsequent periods, we would expect to recognize income tax expense equal to our pre-tax income multiplied by our effective income tax rate, an expense that was not recognized prior to the reduction of the valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had NOLs for United States federal and state tax purposes, including those NOLs acquired as part of past business combinations, of $352,077 and $184,914, respectively, expiring at various times through 2037. In addition, we had Non-US NOLs of $170,366 primarily related to the United Kingdom which has no expiration date.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if we undergo an ownership change\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in our equity ownership over a three-year period, our ability to use our pre-change of control NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes against our post-change income may be limited. The Section 382 limitation is so as to limit the use of our pre-change NOLs to an amount that generally equals the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by a designated federal long-term tax-exempt rate. At December 31, 2021, there were no limitations on the use of our NOLs except for the NOLs of Vocalocity as of the date of acquisition for which the Company has reflected in the deferred tax asset.\nCapitalized Software\nThe Company capitalizes qualifying internal-use software development costs that are incurred during the application development stage. Capitalization is dependent on whether management with the relevant authority has authorized and committed to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 the Company capitalized $46,979, $41,840, and $28,488, respectively, related to the acquisition of software assets which was largely comprised of labor directly associated with internal-use projects.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquired businesses treated as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in determining estimates of useful lives of long-lived assets acquired. Estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, and when appropriate, include assistance from independent third-party appraisal firms.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n45 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021\n ", "item_7_tables": "Table 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td>
