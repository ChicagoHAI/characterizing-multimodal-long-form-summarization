MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation's consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nChampion Enterprises Holding, LLC ( Champion Holdings\u201d) was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 2010. Skyline Corporation ( Skyline\u201d) was originally incorporated in Indiana in 1959. On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (the Company\u201d) was formed by Skyline and Champion Holdings combining their operations pursuant to the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between Skyline and Champion Holdings as described in further detail below.\nThe Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. At March 30, 2019, the Company operates 31 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and 5 manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers and builders/developers, including manufactured home community operators. The Company's retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company's transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada.\nAcquisitions and Expansions\nOver the last several years, market demand for the Company's products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint.\nIn response to the increasing demand for factory-built housing in the U.S., the Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing footprint. The Company is focused on growing in strong HUD-markets across the U.S. as well as further expanding into the Northeast and Midwest U.S. modular housing markets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company completed its expansion of the Corona, California facility by adding a second production line. In October 2017, the Company entered into a lease for two factory-built housing plants in Leesville, Louisiana, one of which the Company expects to begin operations in June 2019. The Company is expanding its Leola, Pennsylvania campus and opened an additional plant in April 2019. In September 2016, the Company, through a series of transactions, completed the purchase of the assets of Innovative Building Systems, LLC and its subsidiaries ( IBS\u201d or the IBS Acquisition\u201d), which included five modular manufacturing facilities and two retail sales centers in the Northeast and Midwest U.S. In January 2017, the Company restarted operations at the Liverpool, Pennsylvania location, one of the acquired modular facilities from IBS. The other former IBS facilities and retail lots remain idle. In addition to these strategic acquisitions, during fiscal 2017, the Company leased and opened a manufacturing facility in Benton, Kentucky as well as reopened a previously idled facility in Topeka, Indiana. The Topeka facility began operations in February 2017. Production at the Benton facility began in August 2016.\nThe Company has also focused on expansion of its company-owned retail operations, opening three additional retail sales centers during fiscal 2018 and five during fiscal 2017. Management believes retail expansion provides an opportunity to increase the Company's presence in market segments that are not currently served through its independent retail network, while also providing for expansion and increased utilization of existing manufacturing operations.\nThese acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company's HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates.\nCombination with Skyline\nOn January 5, 2018, Champion Holdings and Skyline entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the two companies agreed to combine their operations. The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d). Champion Holdings was determined to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champion Holdings as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings existing assets and liabilities. As Champion Holdings is the accounting acquirer, reported financial results for Skyline Champion Corporation for fiscal 2019 are comprised of: 1) the results of Champion Holdings through June 1, 2018 and 2) the combined operations of the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through March 30, 2019. All fiscal periods presented prior to fiscal 2019 are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings, unless otherwise noted.\nIndustry and Company Outlook\nFor fiscal 2019, approximately 76% of the Company's U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD-code construction standard in the U.S. During fiscal 2019, industry shipments of HUD-code homes were 93,377 (or 93,265 excluding FEMA) units compared to 95,044 (or 90,629 excluding FEMA) units shipped in same period of the prior year. The Company's HUD market share during those periods was 16.6% versus 13.9% in the comparable period of the prior year. Sales of HUD-code homes have increased since 2009, when 50,000 HUD-code homes were sold. Fewer factory-built homes were sold in 2009 than in any year since 1959. While HUD-code factory-built home shipments have improved modestly over the past few years, the industry continues to operate at relatively low levels compared to historical shipment statistics. For instance, the long-term average for manufactured home shipments since 1960 is approximately 222,000 units per year.\nThe Company measures and reports on U.S. modular market share three months in arrears. Industry shipments of modular homes in the U.S. of 15,530 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was 9.8% higher than the 14,149 units shipped in the comparable period of 2017. The Company's modular market share during these periods was 13.1% and 11.1%, respectively. Modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009. During fiscal 2019, approximately 18% of the Company's U.S. manufacturing sales were modular. The Company's modular home presence has improved, in part, due to the IBS Acquisition.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 VS. 2018\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year

2019 were $1,360.0 million, an increase of $295.3 million, or 27.7% over fiscal 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nThe U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the majority of the overall growth in net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales of homes for the Company's U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $317.2 million, or 36.9%. The number of homes sold during fiscal 2019 increased by 3,303 units, or 20.5%. The net sales increase was attributable to the following factors including: (i) the inclusion of net sales of $218.8 million for the Skyline operations for the period following the completion of the Exchange; and (ii) a 13.6% increase in the average home selling price as a result of product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of fluctuating material and labor costs.\nThe Company's U.S. HUD market share for fiscal 2019 grew to 16.6% from 13.9% in the prior year due, primarily, to the inclusion of Skyline operations. U.S. HUD industry units shipped during fiscal 2019 were 93,377 which represented a slight decrease from the 95,044 units in the prior year. U.S. HUD industry shipments for fiscal 2019 did not include any FEMA disaster relief homes, according to data published by the Manufactured Housing Institute. Fiscal 2019 industry shipments include the sale of 112 disaster relief homes produced for the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA\u201d) compared to 4,415 in fiscal 2018.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nThe Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $2.0 million, or 2.0% for fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 4.8% increase in average selling price, which was a result of pricing actions taken by the Company to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs. This increase was offset by a 2.7% decrease in homes sold. Net sales had an unfavorable impact of $1.9 million as a result of changes in exchange rates utilized for translation of Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars during fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nCorporate/Other:\nNet sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company's transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For fiscal 2019, net sales decreased $23.8 million, or 22.2%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company's transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S.\nGROSS PROFIT\nThe following table summarizes gross profit for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 214,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canadian Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (106\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate/Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,156\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 245,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit as a percent of sales during fiscal 2019 was 18.0% compared to 16.6% during fiscal 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $70.5 million, or 49.1%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year. Gross profit was 18.2% as a percent of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to 16.7% in the prior year. The 150 basis point increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is due to a combination of factors. The Company has benefited from the synergy capture from the Exchange with Skyline and continues to standardize its core product design and material purchases which allow for more efficient production for its supply chain and helps to mitigate material commodity fluctuations. The Company also continues to focus on better understanding its cost structure and discontinuing models and options that customers do not value.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.1 million, or 0.6%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year and decreased to 18.6% as a percent of segment net sales from 19.1%. The decrease is primarily due to lower sales volume.\nCorporate/Other:\nGross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $2.2 million, or 14.3%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 15.4% from 14.0%. Although overall the transportation business activity was lower than the prior year, gross margins improved as a percent of sales due to product mix.\nSELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation and intangible amortization expense.

The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $32.9 million, or 39.4%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily a result of an increase of $14.5 million related to the inclusion of the Skyline operations subsequent to the Exchange, an increase of $8.7 million related to higher sales commissions and incentive compensation (which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability), an increase of $4.3 million for additional amortization related to the Exchange, an increase of approximately $1.0 million related to investments in plant ramp up of previously idled facilities, and $1.9 million of other administrative and marketing costs. As a result of the increases above, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, was 9.9% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.7% during fiscal 2018.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.3 million, or 3.3%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.2% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.1% for fiscal 2018.\nCorporate/Other:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company's transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $119.4 million during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily a result of an increase of $101.4 million in non-cash, equity-based compensation expense, an increase of $7.6 million increase for Skyline integration costs, an increase of $3.1 million of costs related to the inclusion of the Skyline corporate departments subsequent to the Exchange, an increase of $2.4 million in legal and professional fees, and an increase of $1.6 million of restructuring costs primarily related to redundant corporate and administrative costs subsequent to the Exchange.\nINTEREST EXPENSE\nThe following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,043\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (948\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,095\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (895\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average outstanding floor plan payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average outstanding long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net was $3.3 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.9 million compared to the prior year.

The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 differed from the blended federal statutory rate of 31.5% primarily due to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate of 21%, from 35% due to the comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act \u201d) as well as the effect of non-deductible expense, state and local income taxes, and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities.\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nThe following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (58,208\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (74,008\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,411\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (895\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency transaction loss (gain)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (548\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (122.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition integration costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of non-operating facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (106\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lower of cost or market adjustment of development inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (151\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (68.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2019 was $97.1 million, an increase of $32.5 million over fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, transaction, integration, restructuring costs and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange, and the Offerings and the integration of Skyline. The increase in operating income is primarily due to improvements in sales volumes and gross profit margins as a percent of net sales partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs. See Adjusted EBITDA definition under Non GAAP Measures below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company's results.\nPro Forma Results of Operations\nIn addition to the analysis of historical results of operations, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes unaudited supplemental pro forma results of operations for the fiscal 2019 and 2018. The unaudited pro forma results of operations reflect pro forma adjustments to the results of the Company to give effect to the Exchange and the related financing transactions (the Financing\u201d) as if they had occurred on April 2, 2017, the beginning of fiscal 2018.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of the Company combines the accounting periods of Champion Holdings and Skyline Corporation. Champion Holdings and Skyline had different fiscal year ends. Regulation S-X, Rule 11-02(c)(3) allows the combination of financial information for companies if their fiscal years end within 93 days of each other. Skyline's results for these periods were derived from their unaudited consolidated income statements. Champion Holdings' historical results are derived from Champion Holdings' consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018.\nThe unaudited pro forma adjustments, for activities up to the

million compared to $1,297.2 million in the prior year, an increase of $108.6 million. The increase was attributable to an increase in number of units sold, and an increase in the average home selling price as a result of product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of fluctuating material and labor costs and plant operating improvements.\nPro Forma Gross Profit: Pro forma gross profit increased $46.3 million during fiscal 2019 the compared to the same period of the prior year and improved as a percent of net sales to 18.0% from 15.9%. The increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales is consistent with the synergy capture, operational improvements and product rationalization actions taken by the Company as discussed above. The continued standardization of product design and material purchases has allowed for more efficient production for the Company and its supply chain and helped to mitigate the effects of commodity and labor fluctuations occurring in the market place.\nPro Forma Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Pro forma selling, general and administrative expenses were $272.3 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to $148.5 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased non-cash, equity-based compensation expense of $92.2 million, increased sales commissions and incentive compensation of $9.4 million (which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability), and increased costs incurred with the integration of the Skyline operations of $7.6 million.\nPro Forma Interest Expense, Net: Pro forma interest expense, net was $3.2 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.6 million from the same period of the prior year. The overall decrease is primarily attributable to additional interest income earned from higher average cash balances invested in short-term facilities.\nPro Forma Other Expense: Other expense for fiscal 2019 primarily consists of expenses for legal, accounting and advisory services attributable to the Exchange and the Offerings.\nPro Forma Income Tax Expense: During fiscal 2019, the Company had pro forma income tax expense of $19.2 million and an effective tax rate of (79.3%), compared to income tax expense of $28.8 million at an effective tax rate of 52.9% during fiscal 2018. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, Skyline recognized no income tax expense or benefit as a result of historical operating loss carryforwards which had a full valuation allowance. A portion of the valuation allowance was reversed upon completion of the Exchange, however, that reversal did not have an impact on the pro forma results of operations. The pro forma income tax effects are a result of the income tax effects of the Company discussed above plus the tax impact of the pro forma adjustments.\nBACKLOG\nAlthough orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company's unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders for homes at March 30, 2019 totaled $142.7 million compared to $154.8 million at March 31, 2018. Although backlog increased as a result of the Exchange, overall it was lower than the prior year. Backlog at March 31, 2018 was higher than normal in part a result of pent up demand for core products caused by the production of FEMA units in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal 2018. In addition, backlog for the Canadian operations was lower due to an overall softening in the Canadian economy and housing markets.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 VS. 2017\nTable 64:

</tr>\n</table>\nNet sales for fiscal 2018 were $1,064.7 million, an increase of $203.4 million or 23.6% over fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nThe U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the majority of the overall growth in net sales for fiscal 2018. Net sales of homes for both the U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $182.2 million, or 26.9%, compared to net sales in fiscal 2017. The number of homes sold in fiscal 2018 increased by 2,953 units, or 22.4%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was attributable to several factors including: (i) increased manufacturing capacity in fiscal 2018 as a result of the footprint expansion actions in fiscal 2017; (ii) additional retail sales centers in operation during the year; (iii) the Company's ability to generate additional output at its existing facilities to meet increasing market demand as a result of plant operating improvements; and (iv) a 3.7% increase in the average home selling price in fiscal 2018 as a result of increased market demand and pricing actions to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs. During fiscal 2018, net sales at manufacturing and retail sales centers opened during fiscal 2018 and 2017 had incremental sales of $103.6 million year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2017.\nAs a result of the capacity and operational improvements discussed above, the Company's U.S. HUD market share for fiscal 2018 grew to 13.9% from 12.7% in fiscal 2017. The overall market also grew during the Company's fiscal 2018 as shipments of factory-built HUD homes were 11.1% higher than the same period of the prior year.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nThe Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased $4.0 million in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as the result of an increase in average selling price of 3.8% on essentially equivalent homes sold volume. Sales growth in the Canadian markets, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, continued to lag increases in other markets as a result of the economic impact in Canada of reduced oil prices in recent years. The increase in average selling price is primarily a result of pricing actions to offset the effect of higher material and labor costs, similar to those impacting the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment. Additionally, during the Company's fiscal 2018, the Canadian dollar strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar resulting in an increase in net sales of approximately $2.1 million, compared to fiscal 2017.\nCorporate/Other:\nNet sales for corporate/other include the Company's transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. The 19.1% increase in fiscal 2018 from 2017 was driven by higher delivery activity of recreational vehicles caused by increasing industry demand.\nGROSS PROFIT\nThe following table summarizes gross profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canadian Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,010\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate/Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit as a percent of net sales was 16.6% in fiscal 2018 compared to 16.7% in fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $33.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and improved to 16.7% as a percent of segment net sales from 16.3% in fiscal 2017. The increase was a result of a combination of the additional sales volume discussed above and higher gross margins. Although material prices and labor costs have been increasing in recent periods, the Company was able to offset those effects with price increases, operational improvements and product rationalization. The Company continued to standardize product design and material purchases which allowed for more seamless production for its supply chain and helped to mitigate the commodity inflation occurring in the marketplace. In the same effort to streamline production, the Company continued to focus on better understanding its cost structure and discontinued models and options that customers did not value. Finally, the U.S. manufacturing plants have increased output which allowed for better leverage of fixed costs.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $1.0 million during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and declined to 19.1% as a percent of segment net sales from 21.0% in fiscal 2017. Due to general economic conditions in western Canada, the operations were not able to entirely offset the effects of commodity inflation and rising labor costs. In addition, gross profit was lower as a percent of net sales as a result of a shift in product mix.\nCorporate/Other:\nCorporate/Other gross profit increased $1.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, however, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 14.0% from 15.6% in fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of an increase in brokerage activity that experiences lower gross profits than traditional delivery operations.\nSELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES:\nThe following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canadian Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate/Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,346\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $122.5 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $13.2 million from fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S Factory-built Housing:\nThe U.S. Factory-built Housing segment had a $15.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily the result of: (i) an increase in salaries and benefits of $5.4 million, generally a result of increased compensation and administrative headcount to facilitate expanding capacity; (ii) incentive compensation, which is generally based on a measure of profitability, was $4.6 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017; and (iii) other administrative costs, including professional fees, IT and sales and marketing costs, which were $1.8 million higher in fiscal 2018, generally a result of required support for growth. Although total costs were higher, as a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 were 9.7% compared to 10.0% in fiscal 2017.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nThe Canadian Factory-built Housing segment had a 12.1% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the translation of foreign denominated cash, which has an unfavorable year-over-year impact of $0.6 million. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.1% in fiscal 2018 and 8.4% in 2017.\nCorporate/Other:\nSelling, general and administrative costs for Corporate/Other includes the Company's transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. The decrease of $3.3 million in fiscal 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to gains and losses on certain intercompany debt denominated in foreign currencies. In fiscal 2017, currency losses were $4.0 million compared to currency gains of $0.8 million in fiscal 2018. The intercompany debt was retired subsequent to March 31, 2018 per the terms of the Exchange Agreement. The remaining selling, general and administrative costs were higher in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET\nThe following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (948\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (382\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (566\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (148.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (79\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average outstanding floor plan payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average outstanding long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net was $4.2 million in fiscal 2018, a decrease of $0.1 million from fiscal 2017. The overall change related to increases in both interest income and expense during the period that generally offset. Interest expense increased $0.5 million as a result of the increase in average outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements. Floor plan payables were used to finance retail inventory at company-owned retail sales centers and the increase in outstanding borrowings is consistent with the expanded footprint for the U.S. retail operations discussed above. Interest income increased $0.6 million as a result of an increase in interest generated from higher average cash balances on hand throughout fiscal 2018 and increased investments in short-term cash equivalents.\nOTHER EXPENSE\nThe following table summarizes other expense for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 206.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expense for fiscal 2018 primarily consists of $7.2 million of legal, accounting and other transaction costs for the Exchange. Other expense for fiscal 2017 primarily consists of $1.7 million of costs for the IBS Acquisition and the acquisition of new retail sales centers, and $0.4 million of legal and accounting fees related to the disposition of the Company's U.K. operations.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe following table summarizes income tax expense (benefit) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (217.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (83.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2018, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act which made several changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including among other things, a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Since the Company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the current U.S. corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act was a blended rate of 31.5%. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 was higher than the federal statutory blended rate of 31.5%, largely attributable to the recognition of a $3.3 million foreign investment basis difference and $9.4 million of tax expense due to the deferred tax rate change as a result of the Tax Act.\nThe negative effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was primarily a result of a $35.9 million income tax benefit recognized for the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S. During fiscal 2017, the Company evaluated the realizability of its deferred tax assets and determined it was more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets would be realized.\nGain from Discontinued Operations\nThe following table summarizes gain from discontinued operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2016, the Company committed to a plan to dispose of its U.K. operations, and therefore, classified the results of operations of its U.K. subsidiaries as discontinued and the assets and liabilities as held for sale. The Company recognized a net gain on discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 of $0.6 million. The net gain includes the U.K. operating losses for the period up to the disposition and the net impact of recognizing historical cumulative translation adjustments upon the final disposition. The sale of the U.K. operations was completed on January 20, 2017. Prior to the disposition, the Company accounted for cumulative currency translation adjustments on invested assets and liabilities, and pension actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon final disposition, $8.3 million of net cumulative gains for these items were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36,110\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency transaction gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (548\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,236\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (114.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition integration costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of non-operating facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (106\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (902\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lower of cost or market adjustment of developmental inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 was $64.6 million, an increase of $19.2 million over fiscal 2017.

See Adjusted EBITDA definition under Non GAAP Measures below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company's results.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table presents summary cash flow information for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,030\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,621\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,737\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,518\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (662\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (586\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,982\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 126,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 136,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 102,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, existing cash balances and borrowings under available credit facilities. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to fund capital expenditures. The level of cash availability is projected to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly.\nCash provided by operating activities increased from $31.6 million in fiscal year 2018 to $65.2 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income after adding back non-cash related expenses such as equity-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, which increased due to the Exchange with Skyline and overall operating improvement. The increase was partially offset by costs associated with the integration of the Skyline operations of $8.0 million. Cash provided by operating activities was relatively stable at $31.6 million in fiscal year 2018 versus $33.4 million in 2017. Operating income increased by approximately $19.9 million from 2017 to 2018 but was offset by higher cash tax payments, transaction costs associated with the Exchange, and net cash outflows for changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash used in investing activities was $2.0 million in fiscal year 2019 versus $8.6 million in 2018. The $6.6 million decrease was mainly due to the $9.7 million cash assumed in the Exchange, offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $2.6 million. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017 was $18.7 million versus $8.6 million in 2018. The decrease in fiscal 2018 was a result of cash used in the IBS Acquisition of $14.3 million in fiscal 2017, offset by an additional $2.5 million of capital expenditures for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and $4.5 million less cash received in fiscal 2018 for the sale of non-operating assets.\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 was mainly related to Champion Holdings members' capital distribution of $65.2 million, completed in conjunction with the Exchange with Skyline and a paydown on revolving debt of $5.0 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $6.6 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in net borrowings on floor plan payables of $7.9 million.\nOn June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $45.0 million. Initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company's existing $46.9 million term loans ( Term Loans\u201d) and replace the Company's existing cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. The interest rate on the Credit Agreement is based on LIBOR and was 4.1% at March 30, 2019. The Company had $37.1 million available to borrow against the Credit Agreement at March 30, 2019.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nThe following table presents a summary of payments due by period for the Company's contractual obligations for long-term debt and operating leases as of March 30, 2019:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period: After March 30, 2019 (1) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> <1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility maturing in 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1)\u2002\u2009\u200aThe variable interest on outstanding debt obligations is not included in the repayment information.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (2)\u2002\u2009\u200aBased on the outstanding debt obligations and variable rates in effect at March 30, 2019, the estimated annual interest expense on the revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds would be $2.1 million.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Facility\nThe Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement will adjust based on the first lien net leverage of the Company which will range from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25% and ABR plus 1.25% when first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2.00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50% and ABR plus 0.50% when first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee ranging between 0.40% and 0.25% (depending on first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement.\nLetter of Credit Facility\nThe Company has a letter of credit sub-facility under the Credit Agreement. At March 30, 2019, letters of credit issued under the sub-facility totaled $21.0 million.\nIndustrial Revenue Bonds\nObligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029.\nFloor Plan Payable\nAt March 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements of $33.3 million. The Company's retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. The arrangements provide for borrowings up to $47.0 million. Borrowings are secured by the homes acquired and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the financed home to a customer.\nContingent Obligations\nThe Company has contingent liabilities and obligations at March 30, 2019, including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling $23.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company is contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to independent retailers. The contingent repurchase obligation as of March 30, 2019, is approximately $173.4 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. See Critical Accounting Polices - Reserve for Repurchase Commitments\u201d below.\nThe Company has provided various representations, warranties and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company's subsidiaries historically provided certain parent company guarantees to two U.K. customers. These guarantees provided contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of the units. The guarantees remain a contingent liability subsequent to the disposition of the U.K. operations, which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, no claims have been reported under the terms of the guarantees.\nThe Company has guaranteed a portion of its customers' floor plan obligations beyond the customary repurchase arrangements discussed previously. The Company has agreed to guarantee from 3% to 50% of certain retailers' outstanding loans with financing companies ( Floor Plan Lenders\u201d). At March 30, 2019, those guarantees total $0.8 million, of which, $0.8 million is outstanding. These obligations are not included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are collateralized by the related homes.\nManagement believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nNON GAAP MEASURES - ADJUSTED EBITDA\nThe Company defines Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA \u201d) as net income or loss plus (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) foreign currency gains and losses, (f) equity based compensation awards granted prior to December 31, 2018, (g) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, and (h) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's financial performance that management believes is useful to investors, because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company's operating activities across reporting periods. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance for the following reasons: Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts; in communications with the board of directors and investors concerning financial performance; as a factor in determining bonuses under management's annual incentive compensation program; and as a measure of operating performance used to determine the ability to provide cash flows to support investments in capital assets, acquisitions and working capital requirements for operating expansion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and property, plant and equipment. Historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves, including reserves for self-insured risks, warranty costs and wholesale repurchase losses. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company's most critical accounting policies.\nAcquisitions\nWe allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor manufacturing shipments to independent retailers and builders/developers, sales revenue is generally recognized when wholesale floor plan financing or retailer credit approval has been received, the home is shipped, and title is transferred. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company's manufacturing sales to independent retailers were financed with Floor Plan Lenders. Payment for floor plan sales is generally received 5 to 10 business days from the date of invoice.\nFor retail sales to consumers from the Company's retail sales centers, sales revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered, set and accepted by the consumer; title has transferred; and either funds have been received from the finance company or directly from the home buyer, depending on the nature of the transaction.\nThe Company recognizes revenue and related cost of sales for long-term construction contracts under the percentage-of-completion method. Management estimates the stage of completion on each construction project based on contract milestones and costs incurred. Billed and unbilled revenue on long-term construction contracts is included in trade accounts receivable.\nSales revenue is reported net of applicable sales tax.\nReserves for Self-Insured Risks\nThe Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its general insurance, product liability, workers' compensation, auto, health and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. The Company is liable for the first $150,000 of incurred losses for each workers' compensation and auto liability claim and is responsible for losses up to the first $500,000 per occurrence for general, product liability, and property insurance. Generally catastrophic losses are insured up to $100 million. The health plan is subject to a stop-loss limit of $300,000 per occurrence. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for all expected future expenditures for reported and unreported claims based on historical experience.\nWarranty Reserves\nThe Company's factory-built housing operations generally provide each retail homebuyer or builder/developer with a 12 or 15-month warranty from the date of retail purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold as of the balance sheet date. Factors used to calculate the warranty obligation include the estimated number of homes still under warranty and the amount and timing of historical costs incurred to service homes.\nThe Company has recorded a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold, based upon assessment of historical experience factors. Factors used in the estimation of the warranty liability include the estimated amount of homes still under warranty including homes in retailer inventories, homes purchased by consumers still within the warranty period, the timing in which work orders were completed and the historical average costs incurred to service a home.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIt is the Company's policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, primarily based on estimated selling price, appraised value or projected undiscounted future cash flows.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. As the analysis depends upon judgments, estimates and assumptions, such testing is subject to inherent uncertainties, which could cause the fair value to fluctuate from period to period.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of its reporting units. The assessment was completed as of the first day of March. The assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment.\nIncome Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when the Company determines that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nReserve for Repurchase Commitments\nAs is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the manufacturing operations' sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to the retailers. Certain homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. Certain other homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. For those homes with an unlimited repurchase period, the Company's risk of loss upon repurchase declines due to required monthly principal payments by the retailer. After 24 or 30 months from the date of the Company's sale of the home, the risk of loss on these homes is low, and by the 46th month, most programs require that the home be paid in full, at which time the Company no longer has risk of loss. Pursuant to these agreements, during the repurchase period, generally upon default by the retailer and repossession by the financial institution, the Company is obligated to repurchase the homes from the Floor Plan Lender. The contingent repurchase obligation as of March 30, 2019, is estimated to be approximately $173.4 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. Losses under repurchase obligations represent the difference between the repurchase price and net proceeds from the resale of the homes, less accrued rebates, which will not be paid. Losses incurred on homes repurchased have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements is $1.0 million at March 30, 2019.\nRetailer Volume Rebates\nThe Company's factory-built housing operations sponsor volume-based rebate programs under which sales to retailers and builders/developers can qualify for cash rebates. Rebates are generally based on the level of sales attained during a 12-month period and are accrued at the time of sale. Rebates are included as a reduction of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff balance sheet arrangements at March 30, 2019, consist of the contingent repurchase obligation totaling approximately $173.4 million, letters of credit totaling $21.0 million, and surety bonds totaling $23.6 million. See Contractual Obligations and Commitments - Contingent Obligations\u201d and Critical Accounting Policies - Reserve for Repurchase Commitments\u201d above for more information related to off balance sheet arrangements.\nOTHER MATTERS\nInflation\nInflation has not had a material effect on profitability during the past three years. Commodity prices, including lumber, have fluctuated in recent years, but increases have generally been passed on to customers or mitigated through working with supply chain partners. However, sudden increases in specific costs, as well as price competition, can affect the ability to pass on costs and adversely impact results of operations. Therefore, there is no assurance that inflation or the impact of rising material costs will not have a significant impact on revenue or results of operations in the future.\nSeasonality\nThe housing industry is affected by seasonality, which includes factory-built homes. Sales during the period from March to November are traditionally higher than other months. As a result, quarterly results of a particular period are not necessarily representative of the results expected for the year.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation's consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nChampion Enterprises Holding, LLC ( Champion Holdings\u201d) was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 2010. Skyline Corporation ( Skyline\u201d) was originally incorporated in Indiana in 1959. On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (the Company\u201d) was formed by Skyline and Champion Holdings combining their operations pursuant to the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between Skyline and Champion Holdings as described in further detail below.\nThe Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. At March 30, 2019, the Company operates 31 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and 5 manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers and builders/developers, including manufactured home community operators. The Company's retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company's transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada.\nAcquisitions and Expansions\nOver the last several years, market demand for the Company's products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint.\nIn response to the increasing demand for factory-built housing in the U.S., the Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing footprint. The Company is focused on growing in strong HUD-markets across the U.S. as well as further expanding into the Northeast and Midwest U.S. modular housing markets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company completed its expansion of the Corona, California facility by adding a second production line. In October 2017, the Company entered into a lease for two factory-built housing plants in Leesville, Louisiana, one of which the Company expects to begin operations in June 2019. The Company is expanding its Leola, Pennsylvania campus and opened an additional plant in April 2019. In September 2016, the Company, through a series of transactions, completed the purchase of the assets of Innovative Building Systems, LLC and its subsidiaries ( IBS\u201d or the IBS Acquisition\u201d), which included five modular manufacturing facilities and two retail sales centers in the Northeast and Midwest U.S. In January 2017, the Company restarted operations at the Liverpool, Pennsylvania location, one of the acquired modular facilities from IBS. The other former IBS facilities and retail lots remain idle. In addition to these strategic acquisitions, during fiscal 2017, the Company leased and opened a manufacturing facility in Benton, Kentucky as well as reopened a previously idled facility in Topeka, Indiana. The Topeka facility began operations in February 2017. Production at the Benton facility began in August 2016.\nThe Company has also focused on expansion of its company-owned retail operations, opening three additional retail sales centers during fiscal 2018 and five during fiscal 2017. Management believes retail expansion provides an opportunity to increase the Company's presence in market segments that are not currently served through its independent retail network, while also providing for expansion and increased utilization of existing manufacturing operations.\nThese acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company's HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates.\nCombination with Skyline\nOn January 5, 2018, Champion Holdings and Skyline entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the two companies agreed to combine their operations. The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d). Champion Holdings was determined to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champion Holdings as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings existing assets and liabilities. As Champion Holdings is the accounting acquirer, reported financial results for Skyline Champion Corporation for fiscal 2019 are comprised of: 1) the results of Champion Holdings through June 1, 2018 and 2) the combined operations of the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through March 30, 2019. All fiscal periods presented prior to fiscal 2019 are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings, unless otherwise noted.\nIndustry and Company Outlook\nFor fiscal 2019, approximately 76% of the Company's U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD-code construction standard in the U.S. During fiscal 2019, industry shipments of HUD-code homes were 93,377 (or 93,265 excluding FEMA) units compared to 95,044 (or 90,629 excluding FEMA) units shipped in same period of the prior year. The Company's HUD market share during those periods was 16.6% versus 13.9% in the comparable period of the prior year. Sales of HUD-code homes have increased since 2009, when 50,000 HUD-code homes were sold. Fewer factory-built homes were sold in 2009 than in any year since 1959. While HUD-code factory-built home shipments have improved modestly over the past few years, the industry continues to operate at relatively low levels compared to historical shipment statistics. For instance, the long-term average for manufactured home shipments since 1960 is approximately 222,000 units per year.\nThe Company measures and reports on U.S. modular market share three months in arrears. Industry shipments of modular homes in the U.S. of 15,530 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was 9.8% higher than the 14,149 units shipped in the comparable period of 2017. The Company's modular market share during these periods was 13.1% and 11.1%, respectively. Modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009. During fiscal 2019, approximately 18% of the Company's U.S. manufacturing sales were modular. The Company's modular home presence has improved, in part, due to the IBS Acquisition.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 VS. 2018\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year

2019 were $1,360.0 million, an increase of $295.3 million, or 27.7% over fiscal 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nThe U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the majority of the overall growth in net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales of homes for the Company's U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $317.2 million, or 36.9%. The number of homes sold during fiscal 2019 increased by 3,303 units, or 20.5%. The net sales increase was attributable to the following factors including: (i) the inclusion of net sales of $218.8 million for the Skyline operations for the period following the completion of the Exchange; and (ii) a 13.6% increase in the average home selling price as a result of product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of fluctuating material and labor costs.\nThe Company's U.S. HUD market share for fiscal 2019 grew to 16.6% from 13.9% in the prior year due, primarily, to the inclusion of Skyline operations. U.S. HUD industry units shipped during fiscal 2019 were 93,377 which represented a slight decrease from the 95,044 units in the prior year. U.S. HUD industry shipments for fiscal 2019 did not include any FEMA disaster relief homes, according to data published by the Manufactured Housing Institute. Fiscal 2019 industry shipments include the sale of 112 disaster relief homes produced for the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA\u201d) compared to 4,415 in fiscal 2018.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nThe Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $2.0 million, or 2.0% for fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 4.8% increase in average selling price, which was a result of pricing actions taken by the Company to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs. This increase was offset by a 2.7% decrease in homes sold. Net sales had an unfavorable impact of $1.9 million as a result of changes in exchange rates utilized for translation of Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars during fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nCorporate/Other:\nNet sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company's transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For fiscal 2019, net sales decreased $23.8 million, or 22.2%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company's transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S.\nGROSS PROFIT\nThe following table summarizes gross profit for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 214,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canadian Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (106\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate/Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,156\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 245,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit as a percent of sales during fiscal 2019 was 18.0% compared to 16.6% during fiscal 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $70.5 million, or 49.1%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year. Gross profit was 18.2% as a percent of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to 16.7% in the prior year. The 150 basis point increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is due to a combination of factors. The Company has benefited from the synergy capture from the Exchange with Skyline and continues to standardize its core product design and material purchases which allow for more efficient production for its supply chain and helps to mitigate material commodity fluctuations. The Company also continues to focus on better understanding its cost structure and discontinuing models and options that customers do not value.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.1 million, or 0.6%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year and decreased to 18.6% as a percent of segment net sales from 19.1%. The decrease is primarily due to lower sales volume.\nCorporate/Other:\nGross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $2.2 million, or 14.3%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 15.4% from 14.0%. Although overall the transportation business activity was lower than the prior year, gross margins improved as a percent of sales due to product mix.\nSELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation and intangible amortization expense.

The increase was primarily a result of an increase of $14.5 million related to the inclusion of the Skyline operations subsequent to the Exchange, an increase of $8.7 million related to higher sales commissions and incentive compensation (which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability), an increase of $4.3 million for additional amortization related to the Exchange, an increase of approximately $1.0 million related to investments in plant ramp up of previously idled facilities, and $1.9 million of other administrative and marketing costs. As a result of the increases above, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, was 9.9% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.7% during fiscal 2018.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.3 million, or 3.3%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.2% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.1% for fiscal 2018.\nCorporate/Other:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company's transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $119.4 million during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily a result of an increase of $101.4 million in non-cash, equity-based compensation expense, an increase of $7.6 million increase for Skyline integration costs, an increase of $3.1 million of costs related to the inclusion of the Skyline corporate departments subsequent to the Exchange, an increase of $2.4 million in legal and professional fees, and an increase of $1.6 million of restructuring costs primarily related to redundant corporate and administrative costs subsequent to the Exchange.\nINTEREST EXPENSE\nThe following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,043\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (948\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,095\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 115.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (895\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average outstanding floor plan payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average outstanding long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net was $3.3 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.9 million compared to the prior year.

The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 differed from the blended federal statutory rate of 31.5% primarily due to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate of 21%, from 35% due to the comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act \u201d) as well as the effect of non-deductible expense, state and local income taxes, and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities.\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nThe following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (58,208\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (74,008\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,411\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (895\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency transaction loss (gain)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (548\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (122.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition integration costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of non-operating facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (106\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lower of cost or market adjustment of development inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (151\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (68.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2019 was $97.1 million, an increase of $32.5 million over fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, transaction, integration, restructuring costs and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange, and the Offerings and the integration of Skyline. The increase in operating income is primarily due to improvements in sales volumes and gross profit margins as a percent of net sales partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs. See Adjusted EBITDA definition under Non GAAP Measures below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company's results.\nPro Forma Results of Operations\nIn addition to the analysis of historical results of operations, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes unaudited supplemental pro forma results of operations for the fiscal 2019 and 2018. The unaudited pro forma results of operations reflect pro forma adjustments to the results of the Company to give effect to the Exchange and the related financing transactions (the Financing\u201d) as if they had occurred on April 2, 2017, the beginning of fiscal 2018.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of the Company combines the accounting periods of Champion Holdings and Skyline Corporation. Champion Holdings and Skyline had different fiscal year ends. Regulation S-X, Rule 11-02(c)(3) allows the combination of financial information for companies if their fiscal years end within 93 days of each other. Skyline's results for these periods were derived from their unaudited consolidated income statements. Champion Holdings' historical results are derived from Champion Holdings' consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018.\nThe unaudited pro forma adjustments, for activities up to the date of the Exchange, include:\n \u2022 Adjustments to depreciation expense for the stepped-up basis of property, plant and equipment; \n \u2022 Adjustments to the amortization of intangible assets recognized in connection with the Exchange; \n \u2022 Adjustments to interest expense for the elimination of historical interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees on retired debt; \n \u2022 Recognition of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees on the new revolving credit agreement; \n \u2022 Adjustments to eliminate expenses incurred directly related to the Exchange; \n \u2022 Adjustments to eliminate one-time equity-based compensation incurred directly related to the Exchange; \n \u2022 Adjustments to eliminate the net currency translation gains and losses on certain intercompany debt; \n \u2022 Adjustments to eliminate the management fee, plus reimbursable expenses, paid by Champion Holdings to its primary investors under a management service agreement; and \n \u2022 Adjustments to reflect tax expense for the unaudited pro forma adjustments \nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>

Net Sales: Pro forma net sales for fiscal 2019 were $1,405.8 million compared to $1,297.2 million in the prior year, an increase of $108.6 million. The increase was attributable to an increase in number of units sold, and an increase in the average home selling price as a result of product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of fluctuating material and labor costs and plant operating improvements.\nPro Forma Gross Profit: Pro forma gross profit increased $46.3 million during fiscal 2019 the compared to the same period of the prior year and improved as a percent of net sales to 18.0% from 15.9%. The increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales is consistent with the synergy capture, operational improvements and product rationalization actions taken by the Company as discussed above. The continued standardization of product design and material purchases has allowed for more efficient production for the Company and its supply chain and helped to mitigate the effects of commodity and labor fluctuations occurring in the market place.\nPro Forma Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Pro forma selling, general and administrative expenses were $272.3 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to $148.5 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased non-cash, equity-based compensation expense of $92.2 million, increased sales commissions and incentive compensation of $9.4 million (which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability), and increased costs incurred with the integration of the Skyline operations of $7.6 million.\nPro Forma Interest Expense, Net: Pro forma interest expense, net was $3.2 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.6 million from the same period of the prior year. The overall decrease is primarily attributable to additional interest income earned from higher average cash balances invested in short-term facilities.\nPro Forma Other Expense: Other expense for fiscal 2019 primarily consists of expenses for legal, accounting and advisory services attributable to the Exchange and the Offerings.\nPro Forma Income Tax Expense: During fiscal 2019, the Company had pro forma income tax expense of $19.2 million and an effective tax rate of (79.3%), compared to income tax expense of $28.8 million at an effective tax rate of 52.9% during fiscal 2018. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, Skyline recognized no income tax expense or benefit as a result of historical operating loss carryforwards which had a full valuation allowance. A portion of the valuation allowance was reversed upon completion of the Exchange, however, that reversal did not have an impact on the pro forma results of operations. The pro forma income tax effects are a result of the income tax effects of the Company discussed above plus the tax impact of the pro forma adjustments.\nBACKLOG\nAlthough orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company's unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders for homes at March 30, 2019 totaled $142.7 million compared to $154.8 million at March 31, 2018. Although backlog increased as a result of the Exchange, overall it was lower than the prior year. Backlog at March 31, 2018 was higher than normal in part a result of pent up demand for core products caused by the production of FEMA units in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal 2018. In addition, backlog for the Canadian operations was lower due to an overall softening in the Canadian economy and housing markets.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 VS. 2017\nTable 64:

</tr>\n</table>\nNet sales for fiscal 2018 were $1,064.7 million, an increase of $203.4 million or 23.6% over fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nThe U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the majority of the overall growth in net sales for fiscal 2018. Net sales of homes for both the U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $182.2 million, or 26.9%, compared to net sales in fiscal 2017. The number of homes sold in fiscal 2018 increased by 2,953 units, or 22.4%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was attributable to several factors including: (i) increased manufacturing capacity in fiscal 2018 as a result of the footprint expansion actions in fiscal 2017; (ii) additional retail sales centers in operation during the year; (iii) the Company's ability to generate additional output at its existing facilities to meet increasing market demand as a result of plant operating improvements; and (iv) a 3.7% increase in the average home selling price in fiscal 2018 as a result of increased market demand and pricing actions to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs. During fiscal 2018, net sales at manufacturing and retail sales centers opened during fiscal 2018 and 2017 had incremental sales of $103.6 million year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2017.\nAs a result of the capacity and operational improvements discussed above, the Company's U.S. HUD market share for fiscal 2018 grew to 13.9% from 12.7% in fiscal 2017. The overall market also grew during the Company's fiscal 2018 as shipments of factory-built HUD homes were 11.1% higher than the same period of the prior year.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nThe Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased $4.0 million in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as the result of an increase in average selling price of 3.8% on essentially equivalent homes sold volume. Sales growth in the Canadian markets, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, continued to lag increases in other markets as a result of the economic impact in Canada of reduced oil prices in recent years. The increase in average selling price is primarily a result of pricing actions to offset the effect of higher material and labor costs, similar to those impacting the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment. Additionally, during the Company's fiscal 2018, the Canadian dollar strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar resulting in an increase in net sales of approximately $2.1 million, compared to fiscal 2017.\nCorporate/Other:\nNet sales for corporate/other include the Company's transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. The 19.1% increase in fiscal 2018 from 2017 was driven by higher delivery activity of recreational vehicles caused by increasing industry demand.\nGROSS PROFIT\nThe following table summarizes gross profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canadian Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,010\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate/Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit as a percent of net sales was 16.6% in fiscal 2018 compared to 16.7% in fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $33.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and improved to 16.7% as a percent of segment net sales from 16.3% in fiscal 2017. The increase was a result of a combination of the additional sales volume discussed above and higher gross margins. Although material prices and labor costs have been increasing in recent periods, the Company was able to offset those effects with price increases, operational improvements and product rationalization. The Company continued to standardize product design and material purchases which allowed for more seamless production for its supply chain and helped to mitigate the commodity inflation occurring in the marketplace. In the same effort to streamline production, the Company continued to focus on better understanding its cost structure and discontinued models and options that customers did not value. Finally, the U.S. manufacturing plants have increased output which allowed for better leverage of fixed costs.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $1.0 million during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and declined to 19.1% as a percent of segment net sales from 21.0% in fiscal 2017. Due to general economic conditions in western Canada, the operations were not able to entirely offset the effects of commodity inflation and rising labor costs. In addition, gross profit was lower as a percent of net sales as a result of a shift in product mix.\nCorporate/Other:\nCorporate/Other gross profit increased $1.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, however, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 14.0% from 15.6% in fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of an increase in brokerage activity that experiences lower gross profits than traditional delivery operations.\nSELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES:\nThe following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canadian Factory-built Housing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate/Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,346\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $122.5 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $13.2 million from fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S Factory-built Housing:\nThe U.S. Factory-built Housing segment had a $15.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily the result of: (i) an increase in salaries and benefits of $5.4 million, generally a result of increased compensation and administrative headcount to facilitate expanding capacity; (ii) incentive compensation, which is generally based on a measure of profitability, was $4.6 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017; and (iii) other administrative costs, including professional fees, IT and sales and marketing costs, which were $1.8 million higher in fiscal 2018, generally a result of required support for growth. Although total costs were higher, as a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 were 9.7% compared to 10.0% in fiscal 2017.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nThe Canadian Factory-built Housing segment had a 12.1% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the translation of foreign denominated cash, which has an unfavorable year-over-year impact of $0.6 million. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.1% in fiscal 2018 and 8.4% in 2017.\nCorporate/Other:\nSelling, general and administrative costs for Corporate/Other includes the Company's transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. The decrease of $3.3 million in fiscal 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to gains and losses on certain intercompany debt denominated in foreign currencies. In fiscal 2017, currency losses were $4.0 million compared to currency gains of $0.8 million in fiscal 2018. The intercompany debt was retired subsequent to March 31, 2018 per the terms of the Exchange Agreement. The remaining selling, general and administrative costs were higher in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET\nThe following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (948\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (382\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (566\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (148.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (79\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average outstanding floor plan payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average outstanding long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net was $4.2 million in fiscal 2018, a decrease of $0.1 million from fiscal 2017. The overall change related to increases in both interest income and expense during the period that generally offset. Interest expense increased $0.5 million as a result of the increase in average outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements. Floor plan payables were used to finance retail inventory at company-owned retail sales centers and the increase in outstanding borrowings is consistent with the expanded footprint for the U.S. retail operations discussed above. Interest income increased $0.6 million as a result of an increase in interest generated from higher average cash balances on hand throughout fiscal 2018 and increased investments in short-term cash equivalents.\nOTHER EXPENSE\nThe following table summarizes other expense for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 206.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expense for fiscal 2018 primarily consists of $7.2 million of legal, accounting and other transaction costs for the Exchange. Other expense for fiscal 2017 primarily consists of $1.7 million of costs for the IBS Acquisition and the acquisition of new retail sales centers, and $0.4 million of legal and accounting fees related to the disposition of the Company's U.K. operations.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe following table summarizes income tax expense (benefit) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (217.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (83.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2018, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act which made several changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including among other things, a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Since the Company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the current U.S. corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act was a blended rate of 31.5%. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 was higher than the federal statutory blended rate of 31.5%, largely attributable to the recognition of a $3.3 million foreign investment basis difference and $9.4 million of tax expense due to the deferred tax rate change as a result of the Tax Act.\nThe negative effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was primarily a result of a $35.9 million income tax benefit recognized for the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S. During fiscal 2017, the Company evaluated the realizability of its deferred tax assets and determined it was more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets would be realized.\nGain from Discontinued Operations\nThe following table summarizes gain from discontinued operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2016, the Company committed to a plan to dispose of its U.K. operations, and therefore, classified the results of operations of its U.K. subsidiaries as discontinued and the assets and liabilities as held for sale. The Company recognized a net gain on discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 of $0.6 million. The net gain includes the U.K. operating losses for the period up to the disposition and the net impact of recognizing historical cumulative translation adjustments upon the final disposition. The sale of the U.K. operations was completed on January 20, 2017. Prior to the disposition, the Company accounted for cumulative currency translation adjustments on invested assets and liabilities, and pension actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon final disposition, $8.3 million of net cumulative gains for these items were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36,110\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency transaction gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (548\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,236\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (114.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition integration costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of non-operating facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (106\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (902\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lower of cost or market adjustment of developmental inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 was $64.6 million, an increase of $19.2 million over fiscal 2017. The primary driver of the change from fiscal 2017 was a $19.9 million increase in operating income which was driven by the increase in operating activities and the relative reduction in direct and indirect operating expenses as a percent of sales as discussed above. See Adjusted EBITDA definition under Non GAAP Measures below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company's results.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table presents summary cash flow information for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,030\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,621\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,737\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,518\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (662\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (586\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,982\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 126,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 136,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 102,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, existing cash balances and borrowings under available credit facilities. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to fund capital expenditures. The level of cash availability is projected to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly.\nCash provided by operating activities increased from $31.6 million in fiscal year 2018 to $65.2 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income after adding back non-cash related expenses such as equity-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, which increased due to the Exchange with Skyline and overall operating improvement. The increase was partially offset by costs associated with the integration of the Skyline operations of $8.0 million. Cash provided by operating activities was relatively stable at $31.6 million in fiscal year 2018 versus $33.4 million in 2017. Operating income increased by approximately $19.9 million from 2017 to 2018 but was offset by higher cash tax payments, transaction costs associated with the Exchange, and net cash outflows for changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash used in investing activities was $2.0 million in fiscal year 2019 versus $8.6 million in 2018. The $6.6 million decrease was mainly due to the $9.7 million cash assumed in the Exchange, offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $2.6 million. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017 was $18.7 million versus $8.6 million in 2018. The decrease in fiscal 2018 was a result of cash used in the IBS Acquisition of $14.3 million in fiscal 2017, offset by an additional $2.5 million of capital expenditures for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and $4.5 million less cash received in fiscal 2018 for the sale of non-operating assets.\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 was mainly related to Champion Holdings members' capital distribution of $65.2 million, completed in conjunction with the Exchange with Skyline and a paydown on revolving debt of $5.0 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $6.6 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in net borrowings on floor plan payables of $7.9 million.\nOn June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $45.0 million. Initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company's existing $46.9 million term loans ( Term Loans\u201d) and replace the Company's existing cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. The interest rate on the Credit Agreement is based on LIBOR and was 4.1% at March 30, 2019. The Company had $37.1 million available to borrow against the Credit Agreement at March 30, 2019.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nThe following table presents a summary of payments due by period for the Company's contractual obligations for long-term debt and operating leases as of March 30, 2019:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period: After March 30, 2019 (1) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> <1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility maturing in 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1)\u2002\u2009\u200aThe variable interest on outstanding debt obligations is not included in the repayment information.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (2)\u2002\u2009\u200aBased on the outstanding debt obligations and variable rates in effect at March 30, 2019, the estimated annual interest expense on the revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds would be $2.1 million.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Facility\nThe Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement will adjust based on the first lien net leverage of the Company which will range from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25% and ABR plus 1.25% when first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2.00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50% and ABR plus 0.50% when first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee ranging between 0.40% and 0.25% (depending on first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement.\nLetter of Credit Facility\nThe Company has a letter of credit sub-facility under the Credit Agreement. At March 30, 2019, letters of credit issued under the sub-facility totaled $21.0 million.\nIndustrial Revenue Bonds\nObligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029.\nFloor Plan Payable\nAt March 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements of $33.3 million. The Company's retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. The arrangements provide for borrowings up to $47.0 million. Borrowings are secured by the homes acquired and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the financed home to a customer.\nContingent Obligations\nThe Company has contingent liabilities and obligations at March 30, 2019, including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling $23.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company is contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to independent retailers. The contingent repurchase obligation as of March 30, 2019, is approximately $173.4 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. See Critical Accounting Polices - Reserve for Repurchase Commitments\u201d below.\nThe Company has provided various representations, warranties and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company's subsidiaries historically provided certain parent company guarantees to two U.K. customers. These guarantees provided contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of the units. The guarantees remain a contingent liability subsequent to the disposition of the U.K. operations, which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, no claims have been reported under the terms of the guarantees.\nThe Company has guaranteed a portion of its customers' floor plan obligations beyond the customary repurchase arrangements discussed previously. The Company has agreed to guarantee from 3% to 50% of certain retailers' outstanding loans with financing companies ( Floor Plan Lenders\u201d). At March 30, 2019, those guarantees total $0.8 million, of which, $0.8 million is outstanding. These obligations are not included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are collateralized by the related homes.\nManagement believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nNON GAAP MEASURES - ADJUSTED EBITDA\nThe Company defines Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA \u201d) as net income or loss plus (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) foreign currency gains and losses, (f) equity based compensation awards granted prior to December 31, 2018, (g) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, and (h) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's financial performance that management believes is useful to investors, because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company's operating activities across reporting periods. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance for the following reasons: Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts; in communications with the board of directors and investors concerning financial performance; as a factor in determining bonuses under management's annual incentive compensation program; and as a measure of operating performance used to determine the ability to provide cash flows to support investments in capital assets, acquisitions and working capital requirements for operating expansion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and property, plant and equipment. Historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves, including reserves for self-insured risks, warranty costs and wholesale repurchase losses. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company's most critical accounting policies.\nAcquisitions\nWe allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor manufacturing shipments to independent retailers and builders/developers, sales revenue is generally recognized when wholesale floor plan financing or retailer credit approval has been received, the home is shipped, and title is transferred. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company's manufacturing sales to independent retailers were financed with Floor Plan Lenders. Payment for floor plan sales is generally received 5 to 10 business days from the date of invoice.\nFor retail sales to consumers from the Company's retail sales centers, sales revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered, set and accepted by the consumer; title has transferred; and either funds have been received from the finance company or directly from the home buyer, depending on the nature of the transaction.\nThe Company recognizes revenue and related cost of sales for long-term construction contracts under the percentage-of-completion method. Management estimates the stage of completion on each construction project based on contract milestones and costs incurred. Billed and unbilled revenue on long-term construction contracts is included in trade accounts receivable.\nSales revenue is reported net of applicable sales tax.\nReserves for Self-Insured Risks\nThe Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its general insurance, product liability, workers' compensation, auto, health and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. The Company is liable for the first $150,000 of incurred losses for each workers' compensation and auto liability claim and is responsible for losses up to the first $500,000 per occurrence for general, product liability, and property insurance. Generally catastrophic losses are insured up to $100 million. The health plan is subject to a stop-loss limit of $300,000 per occurrence. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for all expected future expenditures for reported and unreported claims based on historical experience.\nWarranty Reserves\nThe Company's factory-built housing operations generally provide each retail homebuyer or builder/developer with a 12 or 15-month warranty from the date of retail purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold as of the balance sheet date. Factors used to calculate the warranty obligation include the estimated number of homes still under warranty and the amount and timing of historical costs incurred to service homes.\nThe Company has recorded a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold, based upon assessment of historical experience factors. Factors used in the estimation of the warranty liability include the estimated amount of homes still under warranty including homes in retailer inventories, homes purchased by consumers still within the warranty period, the timing in which work orders were completed and the historical average costs incurred to service a home.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIt is the Company's policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, primarily based on estimated selling price, appraised value or projected undiscounted future cash flows.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. As the analysis depends upon judgments, estimates and assumptions, such testing is subject to inherent uncertainties, which could cause the fair value to fluctuate from period to period.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of its reporting units. The assessment was completed as of the first day of March. The assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment.\nIncome Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when the Company determines that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nReserve for Repurchase Commitments\nAs is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the manufacturing operations' sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to the retailers. Certain homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. Certain other homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. For those homes with an unlimited repurchase period, the Company's risk of loss upon repurchase declines due to required monthly principal payments by the retailer. After 24 or 30 months from the date of the Company's sale of the home, the risk of loss on these homes is low, and by the 46th month, most programs require that the home be paid in full, at which time the Company no longer has risk of loss. Pursuant to these agreements, during the repurchase period, generally upon default by the retailer and repossession by the financial institution, the Company is obligated to repurchase the homes from the Floor Plan Lender. The contingent repurchase obligation as of March 30, 2019, is estimated to be approximately $173.4 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. Losses under repurchase obligations represent the difference between the repurchase price and net proceeds from the resale of the homes, less accrued rebates, which will not be paid. Losses incurred on homes repurchased have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements is $1.0 million at March 30, 2019.\nRetailer Volume Rebates\nThe Company's factory-built housing operations sponsor volume-based rebate programs under which sales to retailers and builders/developers can qualify for cash rebates. Rebates are generally based on the level of sales attained during a 12-month period and are accrued at the time of sale. Rebates are included as a reduction of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff balance sheet arrangements at March 30, 2019, consist of the contingent repurchase obligation totaling approximately $173.4 million, letters of credit totaling $21.0 million, and surety bonds totaling $23.6 million. See Contractual Obligations and Commitments - Contingent Obligations\u201d and Critical Accounting Policies - Reserve for Repurchase Commitments\u201d above for more information related to off balance sheet arrangements.\nOTHER MATTERS\nInflation\nInflation has not had a material effect on profitability during the past three years. Commodity prices, including lumber, have fluctuated in recent years, but increases have generally been passed on to customers or mitigated through working with supply chain partners. However, sudden increases in specific costs, as well as price competition, can affect the ability to pass on costs and adversely impact results of operations. Therefore, there is no assurance that inflation or the impact of rising material costs will not have a significant impact on revenue or results of operations in the future.\nSeasonality\nThe housing industry is affected by seasonality, which includes factory-built homes. Sales during the period from March to November are traditionally higher than other months. As a result, quarterly results of a particular period are not necessarily representative of the results expected for the year.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation's consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nChampion Enterprises Holding, LLC ( Champion Holdings\u201d) was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 2010. Skyline Corporation ( Skyline\u201d) was originally incorporated in Indiana in 1959. On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (the Company\u201d) was formed by Skyline and Champion Holdings combining their operations pursuant to the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between Skyline and Champion Holdings as described in further detail below.\nThe Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. At March 30, 2019, the Company operates 31 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and 5 manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers and builders/developers, including manufactured home community operators. The Company's retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company's transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada.\nAcquisitions and Expansions\nOver the last several years, market demand for the Company's products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint.\nIn response to the increasing demand for factory-built housing in the U.S., the Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing footprint. The Company is focused on growing in strong HUD-markets across the U.S. as well as further expanding into the Northeast and Midwest U.S. modular housing markets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company completed its expansion of the Corona, California facility by adding a second production line. In October 2017, the Company entered into a lease for two factory-built housing plants in Leesville, Louisiana, one of which the Company expects to begin operations in June 2019. The Company is expanding its Leola, Pennsylvania campus and opened an additional plant in April 2019. In September 2016, the Company, through a series of transactions, completed the purchase of the assets of Innovative Building Systems, LLC and its subsidiaries ( IBS\u201d or the IBS Acquisition\u201d), which included five modular manufacturing facilities and two retail sales centers in the Northeast and Midwest U.S. In January 2017, the Company restarted operations at the Liverpool, Pennsylvania location, one of the acquired modular facilities from IBS. The other former IBS facilities and retail lots remain idle. In addition to these strategic acquisitions, during fiscal 2017, the Company leased and opened a manufacturing facility in Benton, Kentucky as well as reopened a previously idled facility in Topeka, Indiana. The Topeka facility began operations in February 2017. Production at the Benton facility began in August 2016.\nThe Company has also focused on expansion of its company-owned retail operations, opening three additional retail sales centers during fiscal 2018 and five during fiscal 2017. Management believes retail expansion provides an opportunity to increase the Company's presence in market segments that are not currently served through its independent retail network, while also providing for expansion and increased utilization of existing manufacturing operations.\nThese acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company's HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates.\nCombination with Skyline\nOn January 5, 2018, Champion Holdings and Skyline entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the two companies agreed to combine their operations. The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d). Champion Holdings was determined to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champion Holdings as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings existing assets and liabilities. As Champion Holdings is the accounting acquirer, reported financial results for Skyline Champion Corporation for fiscal 2019 are comprised of: 1) the results of Champion Holdings through June 1, 2018 and 2) the combined operations of the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through March 30, 2019. All fiscal periods presented prior to fiscal 2019 are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings, unless otherwise noted.\nIndustry and Company Outlook\nFor fiscal 2019, approximately 76% of the Company's U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD-code construction standard in the U.S. During fiscal 2019, industry shipments of HUD-code homes were 93,377 (or 93,265 excluding FEMA) units compared to 95,044 (or 90,629 excluding FEMA) units shipped in same period of the prior year. The Company's HUD market share during those periods was 16.6% versus 13.9% in the comparable period of the prior year. Sales of HUD-code homes have increased since 2009, when 50,000 HUD-code homes were sold. Fewer factory-built homes were sold in 2009 than in any year since 1959. While HUD-code factory-built home shipments have improved modestly over the past few years, the industry continues to operate at relatively low levels compared to historical shipment statistics. For instance, the long-term average for manufactured home shipments since 1960 is approximately 222,000 units per year.\nThe Company measures and reports on U.S. modular market share three months in arrears. Industry shipments of modular homes in the U.S. of 15,530 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was 9.8% higher than the 14,149 units shipped in the comparable period of 2017. The Company's modular market share during these periods was 13.1% and 11.1%, respectively. Modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009. During fiscal 2019, approximately 18% of the Company's U.S. manufacturing sales were modular. The Company's modular home presence has improved, in part, due to the IBS Acquisition.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 VS. 2018\n\nNET SALES\nThe following table summarizes net sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\n\nNet sales for fiscal 2019 were $1,360.0 million, an increase of $295.3 million, or 27.7% over fiscal 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nThe U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the majority of the overall growth in net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales of homes for the Company's U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $317.2 million, or 36.9%. The number of homes sold during fiscal 2019 increased by 3,303 units, or 20.5%. The net sales increase was attributable to the following factors including: (i) the inclusion of net sales of $218.8 million for the Skyline operations for the period following the completion of the Exchange; and (ii) a 13.6% increase in the average home selling price as a result of product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of fluctuating material and labor costs.\nThe Company's U.S. HUD market share for fiscal 2019 grew to 16.6% from 13.9% in the prior year due, primarily, to the inclusion of Skyline operations. U.S. HUD industry units shipped during fiscal 2019 were 93,377 which represented a slight decrease from the 95,044 units in the prior year. U.S. HUD industry shipments for fiscal 2019 did not include any FEMA disaster relief homes, according to data published by the Manufactured Housing Institute. Fiscal 2019 industry shipments include the sale of 112 disaster relief homes produced for the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA\u201d) compared to 4,415 in fiscal 2018.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nThe Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $2.0 million, or 2.0% for fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 4.8% increase in average selling price, which was a result of pricing actions taken by the Company to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs. This increase was offset by a 2.7% decrease in homes sold. Net sales had an unfavorable impact of $1.9 million as a result of changes in exchange rates utilized for translation of Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars during fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nCorporate/Other:\nNet sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company's transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For fiscal 2019, net sales decreased $23.8 million, or 22.2%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company's transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S.\nGROSS PROFIT\nThe following table summarizes gross profit for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\n\nGross profit as a percent of sales during fiscal 2019 was 18.0% compared to 16.6% during fiscal 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $70.5 million, or 49.1%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year. Gross profit was 18.2% as a percent of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to 16.7% in the prior year. The 150 basis point increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is due to a combination of factors. The Company has benefited from the synergy capture from the Exchange with Skyline and continues to standardize its core product design and material purchases which allow for more efficient production for its supply chain and helps to mitigate material commodity fluctuations. The Company also continues to focus on better understanding its cost structure and discontinuing models and options that customers do not value.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.1 million, or 0.6%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year and decreased to 18.6% as a percent of segment net sales from 19.1%. The decrease is primarily due to lower sales volume.\nCorporate/Other:\nGross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $2.2 million, or 14.3%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 15.4% from 14.0%. Although overall the transportation business activity was lower than the prior year, gross margins improved as a percent of sales due to product mix.\nSELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $275.1 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $152.6 million compared to the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $32.9 million, or 39.4%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily a result of an increase of $14.5 million related to the inclusion of the Skyline operations subsequent to the Exchange, an increase of $8.7 million related to higher sales commissions and incentive compensation (which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability), an increase of $4.3 million for additional amortization related to the Exchange, an increase of approximately $1.0 million related to investments in plant ramp up of previously idled facilities, and $1.9 million of other administrative and marketing costs. As a result of the increases above, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, was 9.9% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.7% during fiscal 2018.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.3 million, or 3.3%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.2% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.1% for fiscal 2018.\nCorporate/Other:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company's transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $119.4 million during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily a result of an increase of $101.4 million in non-cash, equity-based compensation expense, an increase of $7.6 million increase for Skyline integration costs, an increase of $3.1 million of costs related to the inclusion of the Skyline corporate departments subsequent to the Exchange, an increase of $2.4 million in legal and professional fees, and an increase of $1.6 million of restructuring costs primarily related to redundant corporate and administrative costs subsequent to the Exchange.\nINTEREST EXPENSE\nThe following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\n\nInterest expense, net was $3.3 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.9 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to higher interest income recognized during the period as a result of higher average cash balances invested in short term facilities.\nOTHER EXPENSE\nThe following table summarizes other expense for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\n\nOther expense for fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of $8.2 million of expenses for legal, accounting, and advisory services related to the Exchange and four offerings of the Company's common stock subsequent to the Exchange ( Offerings\u201d), as well as $0.1 million for the deductible on an insured loss at one of the Company's retail sales centers. During fiscal 2018, the Company incurred $7.3 million of expenses related to legal and accounting services associated with the Exchange.\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE\nThe following table summarizes income tax expense for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\n\nIncome tax expense for fiscal 2019 was $16.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of (40.9)%, compared to income tax expense of $27.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 63.4%, for fiscal 2018.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, many of which were a result of the Exchange, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 differed from the blended federal statutory rate of 31.5% primarily due to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate of 21%, from 35% due to the comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act \u201d) as well as the effect of non-deductible expense, state and local income taxes, and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities.\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nThe following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\n\n* indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2019 was $97.1 million, an increase of $32.5 million over fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, transaction, integration, restructuring costs and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange, and the Offerings and the integration of Skyline. The increase in operating income is primarily due to improvements in sales volumes and gross profit margins as a percent of net sales partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs. See Adjusted EBITDA definition under Non GAAP Measures below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company's results.\nPro Forma Results of Operations\nIn addition to the analysis of historical results of operations, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes unaudited supplemental pro forma results of operations for the fiscal 2019 and 2018. The unaudited pro forma results of operations reflect pro forma adjustments to the results of the Company to give effect to the Exchange and the related financing transactions (the Financing\u201d) as if they had occurred on April 2, 2017, the beginning of fiscal 2018.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of the Company combines the accounting periods of Champion Holdings and Skyline Corporation. Champion Holdings and Skyline had different fiscal year ends. Regulation S-X, Rule 11-02(c)(3) allows the combination of financial information for companies if their fiscal years end within 93 days of each other. Skyline's results for these periods were derived from their unaudited consolidated income statements. Champion Holdings' historical results are derived from Champion Holdings' consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018.\nThe unaudited pro forma adjustments, for activities up to the date of the Exchange, include:\n \u2022 Adjustments to depreciation expense for the stepped-up basis of property, plant and equipment; \n \u2022 Adjustments to the amortization of intangible assets recognized in connection with the Exchange; \n \u2022 Adjustments to interest expense for the elimination of historical interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees on retired debt; \n \u2022 Recognition of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees on the new revolving credit agreement; \n \u2022 Adjustments to eliminate expenses incurred directly related to the Exchange; \n \u2022 Adjustments to eliminate one-time equity-based compensation incurred directly related to the Exchange; \n \u2022 Adjustments to eliminate the net currency translation gains and losses on certain intercompany debt; \n \u2022 Adjustments to eliminate the management fee, plus reimbursable expenses, paid by Champion Holdings to its primary investors under a management service agreement; and \n \u2022 Adjustments to reflect tax expense for the unaudited pro forma adjustments \n\nPro Forma Net Sales: Pro forma net sales for fiscal 2019 were $1,405.8 million compared to $1,297.2 million in the prior year, an increase of $108.6 million. The increase was attributable to an increase in number of units sold, and an increase in the average home selling price as a result of product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of fluctuating material and labor costs and plant operating improvements.\nPro Forma Gross Profit: Pro forma gross profit increased $46.3 million during fiscal 2019 the compared to the same period of the prior year and improved as a percent of net sales to 18.0% from 15.9%. The increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales is consistent with the synergy capture, operational improvements and product rationalization actions taken by the Company as discussed above. The continued standardization of product design and material purchases has allowed for more efficient production for the Company and its supply chain and helped to mitigate the effects of commodity and labor fluctuations occurring in the market place.\nPro Forma Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Pro forma selling, general and administrative expenses were $272.3 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to $148.5 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased non-cash, equity-based compensation expense of $92.2 million, increased sales commissions and incentive compensation of $9.4 million (which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability), and increased costs incurred with the integration of the Skyline operations of $7.6 million.\nPro Forma Interest Expense, Net: Pro forma interest expense, net was $3.2 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.6 million from the same period of the prior year. The overall decrease is primarily attributable to additional interest income earned from higher average cash balances invested in short-term facilities.\nPro Forma Other Expense: Other expense for fiscal 2019 primarily consists of expenses for legal, accounting and advisory services attributable to the Exchange and the Offerings.\nPro Forma Income Tax Expense: During fiscal 2019, the Company had pro forma income tax expense of $19.2 million and an effective tax rate of (79.3%), compared to income tax expense of $28.8 million at an effective tax rate of 52.9% during fiscal 2018. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, Skyline recognized no income tax expense or benefit as a result of historical operating loss carryforwards which had a full valuation allowance. A portion of the valuation allowance was reversed upon completion of the Exchange, however, that reversal did not have an impact on the pro forma results of operations. The pro forma income tax effects are a result of the income tax effects of the Company discussed above plus the tax impact of the pro forma adjustments.\nBACKLOG\nAlthough orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company's unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders for homes at March 30, 2019 totaled $142.7 million compared to $154.8 million at March 31, 2018. Although backlog increased as a result of the Exchange, overall it was lower than the prior year. Backlog at March 31, 2018 was higher than normal in part a result of pent up demand for core products caused by the production of FEMA units in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal 2018. In addition, backlog for the Canadian operations was lower due to an overall softening in the Canadian economy and housing markets.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 VS. 2017\n\nNET SALES\nThe following table summarizes net sales for the fiscal 2018 and 2017:\n\nNet sales for fiscal 2018 were $1,064.7 million, an increase of $203.4 million or 23.6% over fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nThe U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the majority of the overall growth in net sales for fiscal 2018. Net sales of homes for both the U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $182.2 million, or 26.9%, compared to net sales in fiscal 2017. The number of homes sold in fiscal 2018 increased by 2,953 units, or 22.4%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was attributable to several factors including: (i) increased manufacturing capacity in fiscal 2018 as a result of the footprint expansion actions in fiscal 2017; (ii) additional retail sales centers in operation during the year; (iii) the Company's ability to generate additional output at its existing facilities to meet increasing market demand as a result of plant operating improvements; and (iv) a 3.7% increase in the average home selling price in fiscal 2018 as a result of increased market demand and pricing actions to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs. During fiscal 2018, net sales at manufacturing and retail sales centers opened during fiscal 2018 and 2017 had incremental sales of $103.6 million year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2017.\nAs a result of the capacity and operational improvements discussed above, the Company's U.S. HUD market share for fiscal 2018 grew to 13.9% from 12.7% in fiscal 2017. The overall market also grew during the Company's fiscal 2018 as shipments of factory-built HUD homes were 11.1% higher than the same period of the prior year.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nThe Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased $4.0 million in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as the result of an increase in average selling price of 3.8% on essentially equivalent homes sold volume. Sales growth in the Canadian markets, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, continued to lag increases in other markets as a result of the economic impact in Canada of reduced oil prices in recent years. The increase in average selling price is primarily a result of pricing actions to offset the effect of higher material and labor costs, similar to those impacting the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment. Additionally, during the Company's fiscal 2018, the Canadian dollar strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar resulting in an increase in net sales of approximately $2.1 million, compared to fiscal 2017.\nCorporate/Other:\nNet sales for corporate/other include the Company's transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. The 19.1% increase in fiscal 2018 from 2017 was driven by higher delivery activity of recreational vehicles caused by increasing industry demand.\nGROSS PROFIT\nThe following table summarizes gross profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017:\n\nGross profit as a percent of net sales was 16.6% in fiscal 2018 compared to 16.7% in fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S. Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $33.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and improved to 16.7% as a percent of segment net sales from 16.3% in fiscal 2017. The increase was a result of a combination of the additional sales volume discussed above and higher gross margins. Although material prices and labor costs have been increasing in recent periods, the Company was able to offset those effects with price increases, operational improvements and product rationalization. The Company continued to standardize product design and material purchases which allowed for more seamless production for its supply chain and helped to mitigate the commodity inflation occurring in the marketplace. In the same effort to streamline production, the Company continued to focus on better understanding its cost structure and discontinued models and options that customers did not value. Finally, the U.S. manufacturing plants have increased output which allowed for better leverage of fixed costs.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nGross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $1.0 million during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and declined to 19.1% as a percent of segment net sales from 21.0% in fiscal 2017. Due to general economic conditions in western Canada, the operations were not able to entirely offset the effects of commodity inflation and rising labor costs. In addition, gross profit was lower as a percent of net sales as a result of a shift in product mix.\nCorporate/Other:\nCorporate/Other gross profit increased $1.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, however, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 14.0% from 15.6% in fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of an increase in brokerage activity that experiences lower gross profits than traditional delivery operations.\nSELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES:\nThe following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017:\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $122.5 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $13.2 million from fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.\nU.S Factory-built Housing:\nThe U.S. Factory-built Housing segment had a $15.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily the result of: (i) an increase in salaries and benefits of $5.4 million, generally a result of increased compensation and administrative headcount to facilitate expanding capacity; (ii) incentive compensation, which is generally based on a measure of profitability, was $4.6 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017; and (iii) other administrative costs, including professional fees, IT and sales and marketing costs, which were $1.8 million higher in fiscal 2018, generally a result of required support for growth. Although total costs were higher, as a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 were 9.7% compared to 10.0% in fiscal 2017.\nCanadian Factory-built Housing:\nThe Canadian Factory-built Housing segment had a 12.1% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the translation of foreign denominated cash, which has an unfavorable year-over-year impact of $0.6 million. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.1% in fiscal 2018 and 8.4% in 2017.\nCorporate/Other:\nSelling, general and administrative costs for Corporate/Other includes the Company's transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. The decrease of $3.3 million in fiscal 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to gains and losses on certain intercompany debt denominated in foreign currencies. In fiscal 2017, currency losses were $4.0 million compared to currency gains of $0.8 million in fiscal 2018. The intercompany debt was retired subsequent to March 31, 2018 per the terms of the Exchange Agreement. The remaining selling, general and administrative costs were higher in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET\nThe following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\n\nInterest expense, net was $4.2 million in fiscal 2018, a decrease of $0.1 million from fiscal 2017. The overall change related to increases in both interest income and expense during the period that generally offset. Interest expense increased $0.5 million as a result of the increase in average outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements. Floor plan payables were used to finance retail inventory at company-owned retail sales centers and the increase in outstanding borrowings is consistent with the expanded footprint for the U.S. retail operations discussed above. Interest income increased $0.6 million as a result of an increase in interest generated from higher average cash balances on hand throughout fiscal 2018 and increased investments in short-term cash equivalents.\nOTHER EXPENSE\nThe following table summarizes other expense for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\n\nOther expense for fiscal 2018 primarily consists of $7.2 million of legal, accounting and other transaction costs for the Exchange. Other expense for fiscal 2017 primarily consists of $1.7 million of costs for the IBS Acquisition and the acquisition of new retail sales centers, and $0.4 million of legal and accounting fees related to the disposition of the Company's U.K. operations.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe following table summarizes income tax expense (benefit) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017:\n\nDuring fiscal 2018, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act which made several changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including among other things, a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Since the Company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the current U.S. corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act was a blended rate of 31.5%. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 was higher than the federal statutory blended rate of 31.5%, largely attributable to the recognition of a $3.3 million foreign investment basis difference and $9.4 million of tax expense due to the deferred tax rate change as a result of the Tax Act.\nThe negative effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was primarily a result of a $35.9 million income tax benefit recognized for the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S. During fiscal 2017, the Company evaluated the realizability of its deferred tax assets and determined it was more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets would be realized.\nGain from Discontinued Operations\nThe following table summarizes gain from discontinued operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\n\nDuring fiscal 2016, the Company committed to a plan to dispose of its U.K. operations, and therefore, classified the results of operations of its U.K. subsidiaries as discontinued and the assets and liabilities as held for sale. The Company recognized a net gain on discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 of $0.6 million. The net gain includes the U.K. operating losses for the period up to the disposition and the net impact of recognizing historical cumulative translation adjustments upon the final disposition. The sale of the U.K. operations was completed on January 20, 2017. Prior to the disposition, the Company accounted for cumulative currency translation adjustments on invested assets and liabilities, and pension actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon final disposition, $8.3 million of net cumulative gains for these items were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2018 and 2017:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 was $64.6 million, an increase of $19.2 million over fiscal 2017. The primary driver of the change from fiscal 2017 was a $19.9 million increase in operating income which was driven by the increase in operating activities and the relative reduction in direct and indirect operating expenses as a percent of sales as discussed above. See Adjusted EBITDA definition under Non GAAP Measures below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company's results.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table presents summary cash flow information for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, existing cash balances and borrowings under available credit facilities. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to fund capital expenditures. The level of cash availability is projected to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly.\nCash provided by operating activities increased from $31.6 million in fiscal year 2018 to $65.2 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income after adding back non-cash related expenses such as equity-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, which increased due to the Exchange with Skyline and overall operating improvement. The increase was partially offset by costs associated with the integration of the Skyline operations of $8.0 million. Cash provided by operating activities was relatively stable at $31.6 million in fiscal year 2018 versus $33.4 million in 2017. Operating income increased by approximately $19.9 million from 2017 to 2018 but was offset by higher cash tax payments, transaction costs associated with the Exchange, and net cash outflows for changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash used in investing activities was $2.0 million in fiscal year 2019 versus $8.6 million in 2018. The $6.6 million decrease was mainly due to the $9.7 million cash assumed in the Exchange, offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $2.6 million. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017 was $18.7 million versus $8.6 million in 2018. The decrease in fiscal 2018 was a result of cash used in the IBS Acquisition of $14.3 million in fiscal 2017, offset by an additional $2.5 million of capital expenditures for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and $4.5 million less cash received in fiscal 2018 for the sale of non-operating assets.\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 was mainly related to Champion Holdings members' capital distribution of $65.2 million, completed in conjunction with the Exchange with Skyline and a paydown on revolving debt of $5.0 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $6.6 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in net borrowings on floor plan payables of $7.9 million.\nOn June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $45.0 million. Initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company's existing $46.9 million term loans ( Term Loans\u201d) and replace the Company's existing cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. The interest rate on the Credit Agreement is based on LIBOR and was 4.1% at March 30, 2019. The Company had $37.1 million available to borrow against the Credit Agreement at March 30, 2019.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nThe following table presents a summary of payments due by period for the Company's contractual obligations for long-term debt and operating leases as of March 30, 2019:\n\nCredit Facility\nThe Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement will adjust based on the first lien net leverage of the Company which will range from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25% and ABR plus 1.25% when first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2.00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50% and ABR plus 0.50% when first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee ranging between 0.40% and 0.25% (depending on first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement.\nLetter of Credit Facility\nThe Company has a letter of credit sub-facility under the Credit Agreement. At March 30, 2019, letters of credit issued under the sub-facility totaled $21.0 million.\nIndustrial Revenue Bonds\nObligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029.\nFloor Plan Payable\nAt March 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements of $33.3 million. The Company's retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. The arrangements provide for borrowings up to $47.0 million. Borrowings are secured by the homes acquired and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the financed home to a customer.\nContingent Obligations\nThe Company has contingent liabilities and obligations at March 30, 2019, including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling $23.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company is contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to independent retailers. The contingent repurchase obligation as of March 30, 2019, is approximately $173.4 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. See Critical Accounting Polices - Reserve for Repurchase Commitments\u201d below.\nThe Company has provided various representations, warranties and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company's subsidiaries historically provided certain parent company guarantees to two U.K. customers. These guarantees provided contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of the units. The guarantees remain a contingent liability subsequent to the disposition of the U.K. operations, which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, no claims have been reported under the terms of the guarantees.\nThe Company has guaranteed a portion of its customers' floor plan obligations beyond the customary repurchase arrangements discussed previously. The Company has agreed to guarantee from 3% to 50% of certain retailers' outstanding loans with financing companies ( Floor Plan Lenders\u201d). At March 30, 2019, those guarantees total $0.8 million, of which, $0.8 million is outstanding. These obligations are not included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are collateralized by the related homes.\nManagement believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nNON GAAP MEASURES - ADJUSTED EBITDA\nThe Company defines Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA \u201d) as net income or loss plus (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) foreign currency gains and losses, (f) equity based compensation awards granted prior to December 31, 2018, (g) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, and (h) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's financial performance that management believes is useful to investors, because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company's operating activities across reporting periods. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance for the following reasons: Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts; in communications with the board of directors and investors concerning financial performance; as a factor in determining bonuses under management's annual incentive compensation program; and as a measure of operating performance used to determine the ability to provide cash flows to support investments in capital assets, acquisitions and working capital requirements for operating expansion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and property, plant and equipment. Historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves, including reserves for self-insured risks, warranty costs and wholesale repurchase losses. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company's most critical accounting policies.\nAcquisitions\nWe allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor manufacturing shipments to independent retailers and builders/developers, sales revenue is generally recognized when wholesale floor plan financing or retailer credit approval has been received, the home is shipped, and title is transferred. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company's manufacturing sales to independent retailers were financed with Floor Plan Lenders. Payment for floor plan sales is generally received 5 to 10 business days from the date of invoice.\nFor retail sales to consumers from the Company's retail sales centers, sales revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered, set and accepted by the consumer; title has transferred; and either funds have been received from the finance company or directly from the home buyer, depending on the nature of the transaction.\nThe Company recognizes revenue and related cost of sales for long-term construction contracts under the percentage-of-completion method. Management estimates the stage of completion on each construction project based on contract milestones and costs incurred. Billed and unbilled revenue on long-term construction contracts is included in trade accounts receivable.\nSales revenue is reported net of applicable sales tax.\nReserves for Self-Insured Risks\nThe Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its general insurance, product liability, workers' compensation, auto, health and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. The Company is liable for the first $150,000 of incurred losses for each workers' compensation and auto liability claim and is responsible for losses up to the first $500,000 per occurrence for general, product liability, and property insurance. Generally catastrophic losses are insured up to $100 million. The health plan is subject to a stop-loss limit of $300,000 per occurrence. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for all expected future expenditures for reported and unreported claims based on historical experience.\nWarranty Reserves\nThe Company's factory-built housing operations generally provide each retail homebuyer or builder/developer with a 12 or 15-month warranty from the date of retail purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold as of the balance sheet date. Factors used to calculate the warranty obligation include the estimated number of homes still under warranty and the amount and timing of historical costs incurred to service homes.\nThe Company has recorded a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold, based upon assessment of historical experience factors. Factors used in the estimation of the warranty liability include the estimated amount of homes still under warranty including homes in retailer inventories, homes purchased by consumers still within the warranty period, the timing in which work orders were completed and the historical average costs incurred to service a home.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIt is the Company's policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, primarily based on estimated selling price, appraised value or projected undiscounted future cash flows.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. As the analysis depends upon judgments, estimates and assumptions, such testing is subject to inherent uncertainties, which could cause the fair value to fluctuate from period to period.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of its reporting units. The assessment was completed as of the first day of March. The assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment.\nIncome Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when the Company determines that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nReserve for Repurchase Commitments\nAs is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the manufacturing operations' sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to the retailers. Certain homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. Certain other homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. For those homes with an unlimited repurchase period, the Company's risk of loss upon repurchase declines due to required monthly principal payments by the retailer. After 24 or 30 months from the date of the Company's sale of the home, the risk of loss on these homes is low, and by the 46th month, most programs require that the home be paid in full, at which time the Company no longer has risk of loss. Pursuant to these agreements, during the repurchase period, generally upon default by the retailer and repossession by the financial institution, the Company is obligated to repurchase the homes from the Floor Plan Lender. The contingent repurchase obligation as of March 30, 2019, is estimated to be approximately $173.4 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. Losses under repurchase obligations represent the difference between the repurchase price and net proceeds from the resale of the homes, less accrued rebates, which will not be paid. Losses incurred on homes repurchased have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements is $1.0 million at March 30, 2019.\nRetailer Volume Rebates\nThe Company's factory-built housing operations sponsor volume-based rebate programs under which sales to retailers and builders/developers can qualify for cash rebates. Rebates are generally based on the level of sales attained during a 12-month period and are accrued at the time of sale. Rebates are included as a reduction of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff balance sheet arrangements at March 30, 2019, consist of the contingent repurchase obligation totaling approximately $173.4 million, letters of credit totaling $21.0 million, and surety bonds totaling $23.6 million. See Contractual Obligations and Commitments - Contingent Obligations\u201d and Critical Accounting Policies - Reserve for Repurchase Commitments\u201d above for more information related to off balance sheet arrangements.\nOTHER MATTERS\nInflation\nInflation has not had a material effect on profitability during the past three years. Commodity prices, including lumber, have fluctuated in recent years, but increases have generally been passed on to customers or mitigated through working with supply chain partners. However, sudden increases in specific costs, as well as price competition, can affect the ability to pass on costs and adversely impact results of operations. Therefore, there is no assurance that inflation or the impact of rising material costs will not have a significant impact on revenue or results of operations in the future.\nSeasonality\nThe housing industry is affected by seasonality, which includes factory-built homes. Sales during the period from March to November are traditionally higher than other months. As a result, quarterly results of a particular period are not necessarily representative of the results expected for the year.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1, Summary of
