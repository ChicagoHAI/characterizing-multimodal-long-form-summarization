Trust is a wealth management services provider. The Bank offers a complete line of consumer, mortgage and business banking services, including loan, deposit, and cash management services to individual and commercial customers. The Bank is an independent community bank and has 19 branches throughout the Hampton Roads localities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Isle of Wight County, Newport News, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg/James City County and York County.\nNet income for 2018 was $4.9 million ($0.96 per diluted share) compared to a net loss of $29 thousand (($0.01) per diluted share) in 2017. The results of 2017 included a significantly higher level of provision expense and the effect of nonrecurring charges related to the termination of the Company's defined benefit pension plan and the passage of the Tax Act.\nIn 2018, the Company's net income increased $4.9 million to net income of $4.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $29 thousand in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a reduced provision expense in 2018 and the impact of two significant nonrecurring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017. First, the Company completed the previously announced termination and settlement of its defined benefit pension plan which resulted in $2.2 million in after-tax compensation expense. Second, the changes to the corporate income tax rate resulting from the passage of the Tax Act precipitated $1.2 million in tax expenses related to the reevaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset.\nAssets as of December 31, 2018 were $1.04 billion, an increase of $56.4 million or 5.74% compared to assets as of December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Company experienced significant growth largely as a result of the Citizens acquisition, which was completed on April 1, 2018. Net loans held for investment grew $34.8 million, or 4.77%, over the year, while securities available for sale declined $8.9 million, cash and cash equivalents increased $27.8 million, and FHLB advances decreased $7.5 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company's financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company's consolidated financial position and/or results of operations. The accounting policy that required management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments is the Company's allowance for loan losses, which is described below.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on three basic principles of accounting which require: (i) that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable, (ii) that losses be accrued based on the differences between the loan balances and the value of collateral, present value of expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan's effective interest rate) or values that are observable in the secondary market and (iii) that adequate documentation exist to support the allowance for loan losses estimate.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies. Management's estimate is based on certain observable, historical data and other factors that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated. This evaluation includes credit quality trends; collateral values; discounted cash flow analysis; loan volumes; geographic, borrower and industry concentrations; the findings of internal credit quality assessments; and results from external bank regulatory examinations. These factors, as well as identified impaired loans, historical losses and current economic and business conditions, are used in developing estimated loss factors used in the calculations.\nAuthoritative accounting literature requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan's effective interest rate) or, alternatively, the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral. However, for those loans that are collateral dependent (that is, if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral) and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable, the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral. Authoritative accounting literature, as amended, also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on loans.\nFor loans not individually evaluated for impairment, the loan portfolio is segmented into pools, based on the loan classifications as defined by Schedule RC-C of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income Form 041 (Call Report) and collectively evaluated for impairment. Consumer loans not secured by real estate and made to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures are segmented into pools based on whether the loan's payments are current (including loans 1-29 days past due), 30 - 59 days past due, 60 - 89 days past due, or 90 days or more past due. All other loans, including loans to consumers that are secured by real estate, are segmented by the Company's internally assigned risk grades: substandard, other assets especially mentioned (rated just above substandard), and pass (all other loans). The Company may also assign loans to the risk grades of doubtful or loss, but as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no loans in these categories.\nSpecific reserves are determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on management's evaluation of the Company's exposure for each credit, given the current payment status of the loan and the net market value of any underlying collateral.\nWhile management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustment to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations or if required by regulators, based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates.\nLoans Acquired in a Business Combination.\nAcquired loans are classified as either (i) purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans or (ii) purchased performing loans and are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition.\nPCI loans are those for which there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. When determining fair value, PCI loans are aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics as of the date of acquisition such as loan type, date of origination, and evidence of credit quality deterioration such as internal risk grades and past due and nonaccrual status. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference\u201d and is not recorded. Any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield\u201d and is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan when there is a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows.\nOn an annual basis, the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans is evaluated. Estimates of cash flows for PCI loans require significant judgment. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent significant increases in cash flows may result in a reversal of post-acquisition provision for loan losses or a transfer from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield that increases interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool(s) of loans. Disposals of loans, which may include sale of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in full or in part from the borrower or foreclosure of the collateral, result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan portfolio at its carrying amount.\nThe Company's PCI loans currently consist of loans acquired in connection with the acquisition of Citizens. PCI loans that were classified as nonperforming loans by Citizens are no longer classified as nonperforming so long as, at re-estimation periods, the Company is expected to fully collect the new carrying value of the pools of loans.\nThe Company accounts for purchased performing loans using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans' contractual cash flows. Purchased performing loans are recorded at fair value, including a credit discount. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. There is no allowance for loan losses established at the acquisition date for purchased performing loans. A provision for loan losses may be required for any deterioration in these loans in future periods.\nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO)\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of similar properties, length of time the properties have been held, and management's ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. The Company may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration in market conditions.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is based upon the results of operations, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses. In addition, certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Act permanently reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21% from the prior maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, companies were required to revalue their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment, with resulting tax effects accounted for in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2017, the Company recorded $1.2 million in additional tax expense based on the Company's analysis of the impact of the Tax Act.\nThe effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 5.37% and (76.98%), respectively. The effective tax rate in 2018 was positively impacted by the Tax Act, a relatively high level of tax-exempt income, and tax credits. The 2017 rate was impacted by the $3.4 million pension termination charge in 2017 which was partially offset by the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Act.\nResults of Operations\nIn 2018, the Company's net income increased $4.9 million to net income of $4.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $29 thousand in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a reduced provision for loan losses expense in 2018 and the impact of two significant nonrecurring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017. First, the Company completed the previously announced termination and settlement of its defined benefit pension plan which resulted in $2.2 million in after-tax compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. Second, the changes to the corporate income tax rate resulting from the passage of the Tax Act precipitated $1.2 million in tax expenses related to the reevaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2018 return on average assets was 0.48% compared to 0.00% in 2017 and the return on average equity was 4.93% at December 31, 2018 compared to (0.03%) in 2017.\nAssets as of December 31, 2018 were $1.04 billion, an increase of $56.4 million or 5.74% compared to assets as of December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Company experienced significant growth largely as a result of the Citizens acquisition, which was completed on April 1, 2018. Net loans held for investment grew $34.8 million, or 4.77%, over the year, while securities available for sale declined $8.9 million, cash and cash equivalents increased $27.8 million, and FHLB advances decreased $7.5 million.\nNet Interest Income\nThe principal source of earnings for the Company is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest and fees generated by earning assets and interest expense paid to fund them. Changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as their respective yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.\nNet interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, was $33.7 million in 2018, an increase of $2.8 million from 2017. The net interest margin was 3.62% in 2018 as compared to 3.64% in 2017. The increase in net interest income year-over-year was primarily due to higher average earnings assets with higher average yields outweighing higher funding costs.\nWhen comparing 2018 to 2017, the following changes occurred. Tax equivalent interest income increased $4.8 million, or 14.03%. Average earning assets increased $82.1 million, or 9.68%. Total average loans increased $95.9 million, or 14.26%, and average investment securities decreased $23.9 million, or 14.04%, as continued loan demand allowed the Company to shift its assets from securities to loans.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $71.0 million, or 11.63%, due to increases in both interest-bearing deposits and FHLB advances. FHLB advances supplemented modest growth in average deposits and provided funding to support loan growth. Total interest expense increased $2.0 million, or 64.97%, when comparing 2018 to 2017. The increase was driven by increased deposit and borrowing costs. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities in 2018 was 0.73%, an increase of 24 basis points from 2017.\nThe following table shows an analysis of average earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and rates and yields. Nonaccrual loans are included in loans outstanding.\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> TABLE I\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS, NET INTEREST INCOME* AND RATES*\n</td> <td> </td>

adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. The Company's primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact the amount of interest income and expense the Company receives or pays on a significant portion of its assets and liabilities and the market value of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, excluding those which have a very short-term until maturity. Management is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the Company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk.\nThree complementary modeling techniques are utilized to measure and monitor the exposure to interest rate risk: static gap analysis, earnings simulation analysis, and economic value of equity (EVE) analysis. Static gap measures the aggregate dollar volume of rate-sensitive assets relative to rate-sensitive liabilities re-pricing over various time horizons. This metric does not effectively capture the re-pricing characteristics or embedded optionality of the Company's assets and liabilities, so it is not relied upon or addressed here. Earnings simulation measures the potential effect of changes in market interest rates on future net interest income. This analysis incorporates management's assumptions for product pricing and pre-payment expectations and is the Company's preferred tool to assess its interest rate sensitivity in the short- to medium-term. The simulation utilizes a \"static\" balance sheet approach, which assumes that management makes no changes to the composition of the balance sheet to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes. EVE modeling estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities in different interest rate environments using discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. This measure provides an indication of the future earnings capacity of the balance sheet, and the change in EVE over different rate scenarios is a measure of long-term interest rate risk. The Company places less emphasis on EVE results due to the inherent imprecision of cash flow estimations and the limited utility of a static balance sheet assumption over the long-term.\nThe Company determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments. These decisions are based on management's expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the state of the national and regional economy, and other financial and business risk factors.\nWhen the Company is liability sensitive, net interest income should improve if interest rates fall since liabilities will reprice faster than assets (depending on the optionality or prepayment speeds of the assets). Conversely, if interest rates rise, net interest income should decline. When the Company is asset sensitive, net interest income should improve if interest rates rise and fall if rates fall. The rate change model assumes that these changes will occur gradually over the course of a year.\nThe table below shows the Company's interest rate sensitivity for the periods and rate scenarios presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> TABLE III\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Interest Rates:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.57\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.42\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (462\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.71\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.02\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (332\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.78\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.49\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (160\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unchanged\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.30\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (466\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.92\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (297\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -200 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3.03\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,086\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.98\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (644\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement cannot predict future interest rates or their exact effect on net interest income. Computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain limitations are inherent in such computations. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.\nChanges in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect the Company's interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is a charge against earnings necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level consistent with management's evaluation of the portfolio. This expense is based on management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management's evaluation included credit quality trends, collateral values, discounted cash flow analysis, loan volumes, geographic, borrower and industry concentrations, the findings of internal credit quality assessments and results from external regulatory examinations. These factors, as well as identified impaired loans, historical losses and current economic and business conditions, were used in developing estimated loss factors for determining the loan loss provision. Based on its analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management concluded that the provision was appropriate.\nThe provision for loan losses was $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $4.2 million for 2017. The decline in the provision for loan losses in 2018 versus 2017 was largely due to lower levels of charge-offs and a decline in net loan growth, exclusive of the loans acquired from Citizens, which were recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, and did not carry an associated allowance for loan loss. Charged-off loans totaled $2.8 million in 2018, compared to $3.3 million in 2017. Recoveries amounted to $644 thousand in 2018 and $330 thousand in 2017. The Company's net loans charged off to average loans were 0.29% in 2018 as compared to 0.44% in 2017.\nThe state of the local economy can have a significant impact on the level of loan charge-offs. If the economy begins to contract, nonperforming assets could increase as a result of declines in real estate values and home sales or increases in unemployment rates and financial stress on borrowers. Increased nonperforming assets would increase charge-offs and reduce earnings due to larger contributions to the loan loss provision.\nNoninterest Income\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons in this section are between the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income decreased $36 thousand or 0.27% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, increases in service charges on deposits (up $283 thousand or 7.31%) were the primary driver of noninterest income growth, while 2017 noninterest income included a nonrecurring gain recognized on the acquisition of Old Point Mortgage, LLC.\nAside from the increase in service charges on deposits and impact of the nonrecurring gain, the other primary increases in noninterest income were other service charges, commissions and fees (up $116 thousand or 3.38%), and mortgage banking income (up $143 thousand or 22.17%). The growth in the service charges on deposit accounts category was related to fees for nonsufficient fund item processing. Other service charges, commissions and fees increased primarily due to growth in merchant processing income. Mortgage banking income increased as a result of the acquisition of Old Point Mortgage.\nThe Company continues to focus on diversifying noninterest income through efforts to expand Trust, insurance, and mortgage banking activities, and a continued focus on business checking and other corporate services.\nNoninterest Expense\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons in this section are between the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's noninterest expense decreased $695 thousand or 1.77%. Exclusive of the pension termination charge of $3.4 million in 2017, noninterest expense was elevated in 2018 due to merger costs, increased salary and employee benefits in part associated with increased staff related to acquisition growth, FDIC insurance costs, data processing and professional services costs related to process improvement initiatives.\nOf the remaining categories of noninterest expense, the most significant changes when comparing 2018 to 2017 were in occupancy and equipment and loss (gain) on other real estate owned.\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Occupancy and equipment (increased $157 thousand or 2.68%): Occupancy expense related to the Citizens acquisition and service contracts for equipment costs were the main increases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Loss (gain) on other real estate owned (increased $104 thousand or (577.78%)): The Company recorded a small gain on the final sales of OREO previously written down in 2017, as compared to a net loss in 2018 related to one property acquired into OREO and sold in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe provision for income taxes is based upon the results of operations, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income, non-deductible expenses, and tax credits. In addition, certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Act permanently reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21% from the prior maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, companies were required to revalue their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment, with resulting tax effects accounted for in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2017, the Company recorded $1.2 million in additional tax expense based on the Company's analysis of the impact of the Tax Act.\nThe effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 5.4% and (77.0%), respectively. The effective tax rate in 2018 was positively impacted by the Tax Act and a relatively high level of tax-exempt income and tax credits. The 2017 rate was impacted by the $3.4 million pension charge in 2017 partially offset by the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Act.\nBalance Sheet Review\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $1.04 billion, an increase of $56.4 million or 5.74% compared to assets as of December 31, 2017.\nAsset growth in 2018 was driven primarily by the acquisition of Citizens. Net loans held for investment increased $34.8 million or 4.77%, from $729.1 million at December 31, 2017 to $763.9 million at December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents increased $27.8 million or 192.93% from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, and securities available for sale decreased $8.9 million or 5.65% over the same period. Total deposits increased $59.6 million or 7.60% in 2018.\nOn April 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Citizens.

The vast majority of the decline was due to principal curtailments on mortgage-backed securities and calls and maturities of other securities, principally tax-exempt municipal bonds.\nThe Company's strategy for the securities portfolio is primarily intended to manage the portfolio's susceptibility to interest rate risk and to provide liquidity to fund loan growth. The securities portfolio is also adjusted to achieve other asset/liability objectives, including pledging requirements, and to manage tax exposure when necessary.\nThe following table sets forth a

Restructured loans are loans with terms that were modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report Form 10-K for more information.\nNonperforming assets decreased by $1.3 million or 8.36%, from $16.1 million at December 31, 2017 to $14.7 million at December 31, 2018. The 2018 total consisted of $2.5 million in loans still accruing interest but past due 90 days or more and $12.1 million in nonaccrual loans. Of the $12.1 million in nonaccrual loans, $11.8 million was secured by real estate. All of the nonaccrual loans are classified as impaired. Impaired loans are a component of the allowance for loan losses. When a loan changes from 90 days past due but still accruing interest\u201d to nonaccrual\u201d status, the loan is normally reviewed for impairment. If impairment is identified, then the Company records a charge-off based on the value of the collateral or the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. If the Company is waiting on an appraisal to determine the collateral's value, management allocates funds to cover the deficiency to the allowance for loan losses based on information available to management at the time.\nThe recorded investment in impaired loans decreased to $16.2 million as of December 31, 2018 from $18.5 million as of December 31, 2017 as detailed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.

and equity lines of credit.\n(2) Amounts listed include student loans with principal and interest amounts that are 97 - 98% guaranteed by the federal government. The past due principal portion of these guaranteed loans totaled $1.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $2.3 million at December 31, 2017. For additional information, refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report on Form 10-K.\n(3) Amounts listed represent restructured loans that are in compliance with their modified terms as of the date presented.\nAs shown in the table above, as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, the nonaccrual loan category decreased by $741 thousand or 5.75% and the 90-days past due and still accruing interest category decreased by $685 thousand or 21.53%.\nThe majority of the balance of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018 was related to a few large credit relationships. Of the $12.1 million of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018, $9.4 million, or approximately 77.25%, was comprised of four credit relationships. All loans in these relationships have been analyzed to determine whether the cash flow of the borrower and the collateral pledged to secure the loans is sufficient to cover outstanding principal balances. The Company has set aside specific allocations for those loans without sufficient cash flow or collateral and charged off any balance that management does not expect to collect.\nThe majority of the loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31, 2018 ($1.7 million) were student loans. The federal government has provided guarantees of repayment of these student loans in an amount ranging from 97% to 98% of the total principal and interest of the loans; as such, management does not expect even a significant increase in past due student loans to have a material effect on the Company.\nManagement believes the Company has excellent credit quality review processes in place to identify problem loans quickly. For a detailed discussion of the Company's nonperforming assets, refer to Note 5 and Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on several components. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance, each segment of the loan portfolio is divided into several pools of loans:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> Specific identification (regardless of risk rating)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> Pool-substandard\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> 3.\n</td> <td> Pool-other assets especially mentioned (OAEM) (rated just above substandard)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> 4.\n</td> <td> Pool-pass loans (all other rated loans)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe first component of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on specifically identified loans that may become impaired. These loans are individually analyzed for impairment and include nonperforming loans and both performing and nonperforming TDRs. This component may also include loans considered impaired for other reasons, such as outdated financial information on the borrower or guarantors or financial problems of the borrower, including operating losses, marginal working capital, inadequate cash flow, or business interruptions. Changes in TDRs and nonperforming loans affect the dollar amount of the allowance. Increases in the impairment allowance for TDRs and nonperforming loans are reflected as an increase in the allowance for loan losses except in situations where the TDR or nonperforming loan does not require a specific allocation (i.e., the discounted present value of expected future cash flows or the collateral value is considered sufficient).\nThe majority of the Company's TDRs and nonperforming loans are collateralized by real estate. When reviewing loans for impairment, the Company obtains current appraisals when applicable. If the Company has not yet received a current appraisal on loans being reviewed for impairment, any loan balance that is in excess of the estimated appraised value is allocated in the allowance. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the impaired loan component of the allowance for loan losses amounted to $116 thousand and $95 thousand, respectively. The impaired loan component of the allowance for loan losses is reflected as a valuation allowance related to impaired loans in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nThe second component of the allowance consists of qualitative factors and includes items such as economic conditions, growth trends, loan concentrations, changes in certain loans, changes in underwriting, changes in management and legal and regulatory changes. For the December 31, 2018 calculation, the qualitative factors which had the most significant impact on the allowance were those affected by changes in the economy and past due and nonaccrual loans. Continued incremental improvements in the economy allowed for a reduction in the allowance. At the same time, past due and nonaccrual loans increased in several categories when comparing December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017.\nHistorical loss is the final component of the allowance for loan losses. The calculation of the historical loss component is conducted on loans evaluated collectively for impairment and uses migration analysis with eight migration periods covering twelve quarters each on pooled segments for both 2018 and 2017. These segments are based on the loan classifications set by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council in the instructions for the Call Report applicable to the Bank.\nConsumer loans not secured by real estate and made to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures are segmented into pools based on whether the loan's payments are current (including loans 1 - 29 days past due), 30 - 59 days past due, 60 - 89 days past due, or 90 days or more past due. All other loans, including loans to consumers that are secured by real estate, are segmented by the Company's internally assigned risk grades: substandard, other assets especially mentioned (rated just above substandard), and pass (all other loans). The Company may also assign loans to the risk grades of doubtful or loss, but as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no loans in these categories.\nThe calculation for December 31, 2018 and 2017 was based on eight migration periods covering twelve quarters each. On a combined basis, the historical loss and qualitative factor components amounted to $10.0 million and $9.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Increases in historical charge-off rates is the major reason for the increase in these combined components when comparing the allowance calculation as of December 31, 2018 to the allowance calculation as of December 31, 2017.\nAcquired loans are recorded at their fair value at acquisition date without carryover of the acquiree's previously established ALL, as credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value. The fair value of the loans is determined using market participant assumptions in estimating the amount and timing of both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and then applying a market-based discount rate to those cash flows. During evaluation upon acquisition, acquired loans are also classified as either acquired impaired or acquired performing.\nAcquired impaired loans reflect credit quality deterioration since origination, as it is probable at acquisition that the Company will not be able to collect all contractually required payments. These acquired impaired loans are accounted for under ASC 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. The acquired impaired loans are segregated into pools based on loan type and credit risk. Loan type is determined based on collateral type, purpose, and lien position. Credit risk characteristics include risk rating groups, nonaccrual status, and past due status. For valuation purposes, these pools are further disaggregated by maturity, pricing characteristics, and re-payment structure. Acquired impaired loans are written down at acquisition to fair value using an estimate of cash flows deemed to be collectible. Accordingly, such loans are no longer classified as nonaccrual even though they may be contractually past due because the Company expects to fully collect the new carrying values of such loans, which is the new cost basis arising from purchase accounting.\nAcquired performing loans are accounted for under ASC 310-20, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs. The difference between the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loan at acquisition date (premium or discount) is amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the loans. If the acquired performing loan has revolving privileges, it is accounted for using the straight-line method\u037e otherwise, the effective interest method is used.\nOverall Change in Allowance\nAs a result of management's analysis, the Company added, through the provision, $2.9 million to the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of year-end loans, was 1.31% in 2018 and 1.28% in 2017. Management believes that the allowance has been appropriately funded for losses on existing loans, based on currently available information. The Company will continue to monitor the loan portfolio and levels of nonperforming assets closely and make changes to the allowance for loan losses when necessary.\nThe following table shows an analysis of the allowance for loan losses:\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> TABLE VIII\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ANALYSIS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td>

Other than time deposits, the demand deposit and money market account categories had the largest increases, totaling $9.3 million and $8.7 million, respectively. Average time deposits, which is the Company's most expensive deposit category, increased by a total of $20.7 million as seen in the table above. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits by the Company in 2018 was 0.60% compared to 0.46% in 2017.\nAs loan growth accelerated, the Company made strategic increases in the rates on time deposits in certain maturities to fund loan growth and manage its interest-rate risk. Selected money market deposit rates were also raised in 2018 to attract and retain desirable customers relationships as market and competitors' rates increased. The Company remains focused on increasing lower-cost deposits by actively targeting new noninterest-bearing deposits and savings deposits.\nThe following table shows time deposits in amounts of $100 thousand or more by time remaining until maturity at the dates presented.\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> TABLE XI\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TIME DEPOSITS OF $100,000 OR MORE\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maturing in:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Within 3 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,121\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,136\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3 through 6 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,699\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11,192\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6 through 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,820\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,830\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Greater than 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 75,689\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 76,418\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,329\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 121,576\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nTotal stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2018 was $102.0 million, up 5.83% from $96.4 million on December 31, 2017 as the increase in retained earnings and capital acquired in the Citizens acquisition offset increases in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net.\nThe Company's capital position remains strong as evidenced by the regulatory capital measurements. Under the banking regulations, Total Capital is composed of core capital (Tier 1) and supplemental capital (Tier 2). Tier 1 capital consists of common stockholders' equity less goodwill. Tier 2 capital consists of certain qualifying debt and a qualifying portion of the allowance for loan losses.\nIn June 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted the Basel III Final Rules (i) to implement the Basel III capital framework and (ii) for calculating risk-weighted assets. These rules became effective January 1, 2015, subject to limited phase-in periods. For an overview of the Basel III Final Rules, refer to Regulation and Supervision\u201d included in Item 1, Business\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's capital ratios for the past two years.

The common stock of the Company has not been extensively traded. The stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol OPOF.\u201d There were 1,635 stockholders of record of the Company as of March 12, 2019. This stockholder count does not include stockholders who hold their stock in a nominee registration.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the ability of the Company to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal funds sold, investments in securities and loans maturing within one year.\nIn addition, secondary sources are available through the use of borrowed funds if the need should arise. The Company's sources of funds include a large stable deposit base and secured advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB). As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $245.9 million in FHLB borrowing availability. As of year-end 2018 and 2017, the Company had $55.0 million and $45.0 million available in federal funds lines of credit to address any short-term borrowing needs.\nAs a result of the Company's management of liquid assets, the availability of borrowed funds and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding, management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors' requirements and to meet its customers' future borrowing needs.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, including economic conditions nationally and in the Company's markets. Depending on its liquidity levels, its capital position, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Company may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity, other securities or other possible capital markets transactions, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for the Company's operations.\nThe following table sets forth information relating to the Company's sources of liquidity and the outstanding commitments for use of liquidity at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

available-for-sale securities decreased from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 primarily due to declining balances in the securities portfolio. Unpledged available-for-sale securities also declined due to a $5.1 million increase in customer repurchase agreements. The increase in repurchase agreements from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 was primarily a result of balance fluctuations in the account of a single customer.\nManagement is not aware of any market or institutional trends, events or uncertainties that are expected to have a material effect on the liquidity, capital resources or operations of the Company. Nor is management aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that would have a material effect on liquidity or operations. The Company's internal sources of liquidity are deposits, loan and investment repayments and securities available-for-sale. The Company's primary external source of liquidity is advances from the FHLB.\nThe Company's operating activities provided $12.2 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $9.4 million provided during 2017. The Company's investing activities provided $12.0 million of cash during 2018, compared to $98.4 million used during 2017, principally due to lower loan growth. The Company's financing activities provided $3.6 million of cash during 2018 compared to $77.5 million of cash provided during 2017. This change is principally due to increases in FHLB advances in 2017.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of the Company, and other financial institutions, to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Company, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities.\nManagement believes that the key to achieving satisfactory performance in an inflationary environment is the Company's ability to maintain or improve its net interest margin and to generate additional fee income. The Company's policy of investing in and funding with interest-sensitive assets and liabilities is intended to reduce the risks inherent in a volatile inflationary economy.\nOff-Balance Sheet Lending Related Commitments\nThe Company had $147.2 million in consumer and commercial commitments at December 31, 2018. As of the same date, the Company also had $8.2 million in letters of credit that the Company will fund if certain future events occur. It is expected that only a portion of these commitments will ever actually be funded.\nManagement believes that the Company has the liquidity and capital resources to handle these commitments in the normal course of business. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the Company that will require future cash outflows. In addition, there are commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, that may or may not require future cash outflows. The following table provides the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More Than 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-Term Debt Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,775\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,775\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term Debt Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 49,550\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,600\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 28,800\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations excluding deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 89,106\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 59,706\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,250\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 843,144\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 714,483\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 91,919\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 36,742\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 932,250\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 774,189\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 121,169\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,892\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-term debt obligations include federal funds purchased, overnight repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank advances maturing within a year of origination.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion is intended to assist readers in understanding and evaluating the financial condition, changes in financial condition and the results of operations of the Company, consisting of the parent company (the Parent) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Bank and Trust. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained elsewhere in this report.\nCaution About Forward-Looking Statements\nIn addition to historical information, this report may contain forward-looking statements.

The Company could also be adversely affected by monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, as well as any regulations or programs implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act or other legislation and policies of the Comptroller, U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board.\nThese risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained herein, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made, except as otherwise required by law. In addition, past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nExecutive Overview\nHeadquartered in Hampton, Virginia, the Company is the parent company of Trust and the Bank. Trust is a wealth management services provider. The Bank offers a complete line of consumer, mortgage and business banking services, including loan, deposit, and cash management services to individual and commercial customers. The Bank is an independent community bank and has 19 branches throughout the Hampton Roads localities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Isle of Wight County, Newport News, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg/James City County and York County.\nNet income for 2018 was $4.9 million ($0.96 per diluted share) compared to a net loss of $29 thousand (($0.01) per diluted share) in 2017. The results of 2017 included a significantly higher level of provision expense and the effect of nonrecurring charges related to the termination of the Company's defined benefit pension plan and the passage of the Tax Act.\nIn 2018, the Company's net income increased $4.9 million to net income of $4.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $29 thousand in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a reduced provision expense in 2018 and the impact of two significant nonrecurring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017. First, the Company completed the previously announced termination and settlement of its defined benefit pension plan which resulted in $2.2 million in after-tax compensation expense. Second, the changes to the corporate income tax rate resulting from the passage of the Tax Act precipitated $1.2 million in tax expenses related to the reevaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset.\nAssets as of December 31, 2018 were $1.04 billion, an increase of $56.4 million or 5.74% compared to assets as of December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Company experienced significant growth largely as a result of the Citizens acquisition, which was completed on April 1, 2018. Net loans held for investment grew $34.8 million, or 4.77%, over the year, while securities available for sale declined $8.9 million, cash and cash equivalents increased $27.8 million, and FHLB advances decreased $7.5 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company's financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company's consolidated financial position and/or results of operations. The accounting policy that required management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments is the Company's allowance for loan losses, which is described below.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on three basic principles of accounting which require: (i) that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable, (ii) that losses be accrued based on the differences between the loan balances and the value of collateral, present value of expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan's effective interest rate) or values that are observable in the secondary market and (iii) that adequate documentation exist to support the allowance for loan losses estimate.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies. Management's estimate is based on certain observable, historical data and other factors that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated. This evaluation includes credit quality trends; collateral values; discounted cash flow analysis; loan volumes; geographic, borrower and industry concentrations; the findings of internal credit quality assessments; and results from external bank regulatory examinations. These factors, as well as identified impaired loans, historical losses and current economic and business conditions, are used in developing estimated loss factors used in the calculations.\nAuthoritative accounting literature requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan's effective interest rate) or, alternatively, the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral. However, for those loans that are collateral dependent (that is, if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral) and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable, the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral. Authoritative accounting literature, as amended, also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on loans.\nFor loans not individually evaluated for impairment, the loan portfolio is segmented into pools, based on the loan classifications as defined by Schedule RC-C of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income Form 041 (Call Report) and collectively evaluated for impairment. Consumer loans not secured by real estate and made to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures are segmented into pools based on whether the loan's payments are current (including loans 1-29 days past due), 30 - 59 days past due, 60 - 89 days past due, or 90 days or more past due. All other loans, including loans to consumers that are secured by real estate, are segmented by the Company's internally assigned risk grades: substandard, other assets especially mentioned (rated just above substandard), and pass (all other loans). The Company may also assign loans to the risk grades of doubtful or loss, but as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no loans in these categories.\nSpecific reserves are determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on management's evaluation of the Company's exposure for each credit, given the current payment status of the loan and the net market value of any underlying collateral.\nWhile management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustment to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations or if required by regulators, based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates.\nLoans Acquired in a Business Combination.\nAcquired loans are classified as either (i) purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans or (ii) purchased performing loans and are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition.\nPCI loans are those for which there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. When determining fair value, PCI loans are aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics as of the date of acquisition such as loan type, date of origination, and evidence of credit quality deterioration such as internal risk grades and past due and nonaccrual status. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference\u201d and is not recorded. Any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield\u201d and is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan when there is a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows.\nOn an annual basis, the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans is evaluated. Estimates of cash flows for PCI loans require significant judgment. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent significant increases in cash flows may result in a reversal of post-acquisition provision for loan losses or a transfer from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield that increases interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool(s) of loans. Disposals of loans, which may include sale of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in full or in part from the borrower or foreclosure of the collateral, result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan portfolio at its carrying amount.\nThe Company's PCI loans currently consist of loans acquired in connection with the acquisition of Citizens. PCI loans that were classified as nonperforming loans by Citizens are no longer classified as nonperforming so long as, at re-estimation periods, the Company is expected to fully collect the new carrying value of the pools of loans.\nThe Company accounts for purchased performing loans using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans' contractual cash flows. Purchased performing loans are recorded at fair value, including a credit discount. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. There is no allowance for loan losses established at the acquisition date for purchased performing loans. A provision for loan losses may be required for any deterioration in these loans in future periods.\nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO)\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of similar properties, length of time the properties have been held, and management's ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. The Company may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration in market conditions.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is based upon the results of operations, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses. In addition, certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Act permanently reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21% from the prior maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, companies were required to revalue their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment, with resulting tax effects accounted for in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2017, the Company recorded $1.2 million in additional tax expense based on the Company's analysis of the impact of the Tax Act.\nThe effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 5.37% and (76.98%), respectively. The effective tax rate in 2018 was positively impacted by the Tax Act, a relatively high level of tax-exempt income, and tax credits. The 2017 rate was impacted by the $3.4 million pension termination charge in 2017 which was partially offset by the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Act.\nResults of Operations\nIn 2018, the Company's net income increased $4.9 million to net income of $4.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $29 thousand in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a reduced provision for loan losses expense in 2018 and the impact of two significant nonrecurring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017. First, the Company completed the previously announced termination and settlement of its defined benefit pension plan which resulted in $2.2 million in after-tax compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. Second, the changes to the corporate income tax rate resulting from the passage of the Tax Act precipitated $1.2 million in tax expenses related to the reevaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2018 return on average assets was 0.48% compared to 0.00% in 2017 and the return on average equity was 4.93% at December 31, 2018 compared to (0.03%) in 2017.\nAssets as of December 31, 2018 were $1.04 billion, an increase of $56.4 million or 5.74% compared to assets as of December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Company experienced significant growth largely as a result of the Citizens acquisition, which was completed on April 1, 2018. Net loans held for investment grew $34.8 million, or 4.77%, over the year, while securities available for sale declined $8.9 million, cash and cash equivalents increased $27.8 million, and FHLB advances decreased $7.5 million.\nNet Interest Income\nThe principal source of earnings for the Company is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest and fees generated by earning assets and interest expense paid to fund them. Changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as their respective yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.\nNet interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, was $33.7 million in 2018, an increase of $2.8 million from 2017. The net interest margin was 3.62% in 2018 as compared to 3.64% in 2017. The increase in net interest income year-over-year was primarily due to higher average earnings assets with higher average yields outweighing higher funding costs.\nWhen comparing 2018 to 2017, the following changes occurred. Tax equivalent interest income increased $4.8 million, or 14.03%. Average earning assets increased $82.1 million, or 9.68%. Total average loans increased $95.9 million, or 14.26%, and average investment securities decreased $23.9 million, or 14.04%, as continued loan demand allowed the Company to shift its assets from securities to loans.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $71.0 million, or 11.63%, due to increases in both interest-bearing deposits and FHLB advances. FHLB advances supplemented modest growth in average deposits and provided funding to support loan growth. Total interest expense increased $2.0 million, or 64.97%, when comparing 2018 to 2017. The increase was driven by increased deposit and borrowing costs. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities in 2018 was 0.73%, an increase of 24 basis points from 2017.\nThe following table shows an analysis of average earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and rates and yields. Nonaccrual loans are included in loans outstanding.\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> TABLE I\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS, NET INTEREST INCOME* AND RATES*\n</td> <td> </td>

adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. The Company's primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact the amount of interest income and expense the Company receives or pays on a significant portion of its assets and liabilities and the market value of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, excluding those which have a very short-term until maturity. Management is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the Company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk.\nThree complementary modeling techniques are utilized to measure and monitor the exposure to interest rate risk: static gap analysis, earnings simulation analysis, and economic value of equity (EVE) analysis. Static gap measures the aggregate dollar volume of rate-sensitive assets relative to rate-sensitive liabilities re-pricing over various time horizons. This metric does not effectively capture the re-pricing characteristics or embedded optionality of the Company's assets and liabilities, so it is not relied upon or addressed here. Earnings simulation measures the potential effect of changes in market interest rates on future net interest income. This analysis incorporates management's assumptions for product pricing and pre-payment expectations and is the Company's preferred tool to assess its interest rate sensitivity in the short- to medium-term. The simulation utilizes a \"static\" balance sheet approach, which assumes that management makes no changes to the composition of the balance sheet to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes. EVE modeling estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities in different interest rate environments using discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. This measure provides an indication of the future earnings capacity of the balance sheet, and the change in EVE over different rate scenarios is a measure of long-term interest rate risk. The Company places less emphasis on EVE results due to the inherent imprecision of cash flow estimations and the limited utility of a static balance sheet assumption over the long-term.\nThe Company determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments. These decisions are based on management's expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the state of the national and regional economy, and other financial and business risk factors.\nWhen the Company is liability sensitive, net interest income should improve if interest rates fall since liabilities will reprice faster than assets (depending on the optionality or prepayment speeds of the assets). Conversely, if interest rates rise, net interest income should decline. When the Company is asset sensitive, net interest income should improve if interest rates rise and fall if rates fall. The rate change model assumes that these changes will occur gradually over the course of a year.\nThe table below shows the Company's interest rate sensitivity for the periods and rate scenarios presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> TABLE III\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Interest Rates:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.57\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.42\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (462\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.71\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.02\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (332\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.78\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.49\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (160\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unchanged\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.30\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (466\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (0.92\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (297\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -200 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3.03\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,086\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.98\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (644\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement cannot predict future interest rates or their exact effect on net interest income. Computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain limitations are inherent in such computations. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.\nChanges in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect the Company's interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is a charge against earnings necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level consistent with management's evaluation of the portfolio. This expense is based on management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management's evaluation included credit quality trends, collateral values, discounted cash flow analysis, loan volumes, geographic, borrower and industry concentrations, the findings of internal credit quality assessments and results from external regulatory examinations. These factors, as well as identified impaired loans, historical losses and current economic and business conditions, were used in developing estimated loss factors for determining the loan loss provision. Based on its analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management concluded that the provision was appropriate.\nThe provision for loan losses was $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $4.2 million for 2017. The decline in the provision for loan losses in 2018 versus 2017 was largely due to lower levels of charge-offs and a decline in net loan growth, exclusive of the loans acquired from Citizens, which were recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, and did not carry an associated allowance for loan loss. Charged-off loans totaled $2.8 million in 2018, compared to $3.3 million in 2017. Recoveries amounted to $644 thousand in 2018 and $330 thousand in 2017. The Company's net loans charged off to average loans were 0.29% in 2018 as compared to 0.44% in 2017.\nThe state of the local economy can have a significant impact on the level of loan charge-offs. If the economy begins to contract, nonperforming assets could increase as a result of declines in real estate values and home sales or increases in unemployment rates and financial stress on borrowers. Increased nonperforming assets would increase charge-offs and reduce earnings due to larger contributions to the loan loss provision.\nNoninterest Income\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons in this section are between the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income decreased $36 thousand or 0.27% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, increases in service charges on deposits (up $283 thousand or 7.31%) were the primary driver of noninterest income growth, while 2017 noninterest income included a nonrecurring gain recognized on the acquisition of Old Point Mortgage, LLC.\nAside from the increase in service charges on deposits and impact of the nonrecurring gain, the other primary increases in noninterest income were other service charges, commissions and fees (up $116 thousand or 3.38%), and mortgage banking income (up $143 thousand or 22.17%). The growth in the service charges on deposit accounts category was related to fees for nonsufficient fund item processing. Other service charges, commissions and fees increased primarily due to growth in merchant processing income. Mortgage banking income increased as a result of the acquisition of Old Point Mortgage.\nThe Company continues to focus on diversifying noninterest income through efforts to expand Trust, insurance, and mortgage banking activities, and a continued focus on business checking and other corporate services.\nNoninterest Expense\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons in this section are between the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's noninterest expense decreased $695 thousand or 1.77%. Exclusive of the pension termination charge of $3.4 million in 2017, noninterest expense was elevated in 2018 due to merger costs, increased salary and employee benefits in part associated with increased staff related to acquisition growth, FDIC insurance costs, data processing and professional services costs related to process improvement initiatives.\nOf the remaining categories of noninterest expense, the most significant changes when comparing 2018 to 2017 were in occupancy and equipment and loss (gain) on other real estate owned.\n \u00b7 Occupancy and equipment (increased $157 thousand or 2.68%): Occupancy expense related to the Citizens acquisition and service contracts for equipment costs were the main increases. \n \u00b7 Loss (gain) on other real estate owned (increased $104 thousand or (577.78%)): The Company recorded a small gain on the final sales of OREO previously written down in 2017, as compared to a net loss in 2018 related to one property acquired into OREO and sold in 2018. \nThe provision for income taxes is based upon the results of operations, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income, non-deductible expenses, and tax credits. In addition, certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Act permanently reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21% from the prior maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, companies were required to revalue their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment, with resulting tax effects accounted for in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2017, the Company recorded $1.2 million in additional tax expense based on the Company's analysis of the impact of the Tax Act.\nThe effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 5.4% and (77.0%), respectively. The effective tax rate in 2018 was positively impacted by the Tax Act and a relatively high level of tax-exempt income and tax credits. The 2017 rate was impacted by the $3.4 million pension charge in 2017 partially offset by the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Act.\nBalance Sheet Review\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $1.04 billion, an increase of $56.4 million or 5.74% compared to assets as of December 31, 2017.\nAsset growth in 2018 was driven primarily by the acquisition of Citizens. Net loans held for investment increased $34.8 million or 4.77%, from $729.1 million at December 31, 2017 to $763.9 million at December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents increased $27.8 million or 192.93% from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, and securities available for sale decreased $8.9 million or 5.65% over the same period. Total deposits increased $59.6 million or 7.60% in 2018.\nOn April 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Citizens. Below is a summary of the transaction and related impact on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \u00b7 The fair value of assets acquired equaled $50.4 million and the fair value of liabilities assumed equaled $44.3 million. \n \u00b7 Loans held for investment acquired totaled $42.8 million, as acquired and at fair value. \n \u00b7 Total deposits assumed totaled $43.8 million with a fair value of $44.0 million. \n \u00b7 Total goodwill arising from the transaction equaled $1.0 million. \n \u00b7 Core deposit intangibles acquired totaled $440 thousand. \nSecurities Portfolio\nWhen comparing December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017, securities available-for-sale decreased $8.9 million, or 5.65%. The vast majority of the decline was due to principal curtailments on mortgage-backed securities and calls and maturities of other securities, principally tax-exempt municipal bonds.\nThe Company's strategy for the securities portfolio is primarily intended to manage the portfolio's susceptibility to interest rate risk and to provide liquidity to fund loan growth. The securities portfolio is also adjusted to achieve other asset/liability objectives, including pledging requirements, and to manage tax exposure when necessary.\nThe following table sets forth a

The Citizens portfolio mainly focused on commercial real estate, construction, and commercial and industrial lending. 2017 loan growth was aided significantly by growth in the indirect dealer lending division.\nThe maturity distribution and rate sensitivity of certain categories of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 is presented below:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> TABLE VI\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MATURITY SCHEDULE OF SELECTED LOANS\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> Within 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 to 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,079\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,934\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,385\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,398\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,744\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,623\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 32,383\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,823\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,557\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,401\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 95,781\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans due after 1 year with:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,326\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,222\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,548\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Variable interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,231\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,179\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,410\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,557\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,401\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,958\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest, nonperforming restructured loans, and other real estate owned (OREO). Restructured loans are loans with terms that were modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report Form 10-K for more information.\nNonperforming assets decreased by $1.3 million or 8.36%, from $16.1 million at December 31, 2017 to $14.7 million at December 31, 2018. The 2018 total consisted of $2.5 million in loans still accruing interest but past due 90 days or more and $12.1 million in nonaccrual loans. Of the $12.1 million in nonaccrual loans, $11.8 million was secured by real estate. All of the nonaccrual loans are classified as impaired. Impaired loans are a component of the allowance for loan losses. When a loan changes from 90 days past due but still accruing interest\u201d to nonaccrual\u201d status, the loan is normally reviewed for impairment. If impairment is identified, then the Company records a charge-off based on the value of the collateral or the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. If the Company is waiting on an appraisal to determine the collateral's value, management allocates funds to cover the deficiency to the allowance for loan losses based on information available to management at the time.\nThe recorded investment in impaired loans decreased to $16.2 million as of December 31, 2018 from $18.5 million as of December 31, 2017 as detailed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K. The majority of these loans were collateralized.\nThe following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of nonperforming assets, which includes nonaccrual loans, past due loans,

and equity lines of credit.\n(2) Amounts listed include student loans with principal and interest amounts that are 97 - 98% guaranteed by the federal government. The past due principal portion of these guaranteed loans totaled $1.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $2.3 million at December 31, 2017. For additional information, refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report on Form 10-K.\n(3) Amounts listed represent restructured loans that are in compliance with their modified terms as of the date presented.\nAs shown in the table above, as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, the nonaccrual loan category decreased by $741 thousand or 5.75% and the 90-days past due and still accruing interest category decreased by $685 thousand or 21.53%.\nThe majority of the balance of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018 was related to a few large credit relationships. Of the $12.1 million of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018, $9.4 million, or approximately 77.25%, was comprised of four credit relationships. All loans in these relationships have been analyzed to determine whether the cash flow of the borrower and the collateral pledged to secure the loans is sufficient to cover outstanding principal balances. The Company has set aside specific allocations for those loans without sufficient cash flow or collateral and charged off any balance that management does not expect to collect.\nThe majority of the loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31, 2018 ($1.7 million) were student loans. The federal government has provided guarantees of repayment of these student loans in an amount ranging from 97% to 98% of the total principal and interest of the loans; as such, management does not expect even a significant increase in past due student loans to have a material effect on the Company.\nManagement believes the Company has excellent credit quality review processes in place to identify problem loans quickly. For a detailed discussion of the Company's nonperforming assets, refer to Note 5 and Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on several components. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance, each segment of the loan portfolio is divided into several pools of loans:\n 1. Specific identification (regardless of risk rating) \n 2. Pool-substandard \n 3. Pool-other assets especially mentioned (OAEM) (rated just above substandard) \n 4. Pool-pass loans (all other rated loans) \nThe first component of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on specifically identified loans that may become impaired. These loans are individually analyzed for impairment and include nonperforming loans and both performing and nonperforming TDRs. This component may also include loans considered impaired for other reasons, such as outdated financial information on the borrower or guarantors or financial problems of the borrower, including operating losses, marginal working capital, inadequate cash flow, or business interruptions. Changes in TDRs and nonperforming loans affect the dollar amount of the allowance. Increases in the impairment allowance for TDRs and nonperforming loans are reflected as an increase in the allowance for loan losses except in situations where the TDR or nonperforming loan does not require a specific allocation (i.e., the discounted present value of expected future cash flows or the collateral value is considered sufficient).\nThe majority of the Company's TDRs and nonperforming loans are collateralized by real estate. When reviewing loans for impairment, the Company obtains current appraisals when applicable. If the Company has not yet received a current appraisal on loans being reviewed for impairment, any loan balance that is in excess of the estimated appraised value is allocated in the allowance. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the impaired loan component of the allowance for loan losses amounted to $116 thousand and $95 thousand, respectively. The impaired loan component of the allowance for loan losses is reflected as a valuation allowance related to impaired loans in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nThe second component of the allowance consists of qualitative factors and includes items such as economic conditions, growth trends, loan concentrations, changes in certain loans, changes in underwriting, changes in management and legal and regulatory changes. For the December 31, 2018 calculation, the qualitative factors which had the most significant impact on the allowance were those affected by changes in the economy and past due and nonaccrual loans. Continued incremental improvements in the economy allowed for a reduction in the allowance. At the same time, past due and nonaccrual loans increased in several categories when comparing December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017.\nHistorical loss is the final component of the allowance for loan losses. The calculation of the historical loss component is conducted on loans evaluated collectively for impairment and uses migration analysis with eight migration periods covering twelve quarters each on pooled segments for both 2018 and 2017. These segments are based on the loan classifications set by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council in the instructions for the Call Report applicable to the Bank.\nConsumer loans not secured by real estate and made to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures are segmented into pools based on whether the loan's payments are current (including loans 1 - 29 days past due), 30 - 59 days past due, 60 - 89 days past due, or 90 days or more past due. All other loans, including loans to consumers that are secured by real estate, are segmented by the Company's internally assigned risk grades: substandard, other assets especially mentioned (rated just above substandard), and pass (all other loans). The Company may also assign loans to the risk grades of doubtful or loss, but as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no loans in these categories.\nThe calculation for December 31, 2018 and 2017 was based on eight migration periods covering twelve quarters each. On a combined basis, the historical loss and qualitative factor components amounted to $10.0 million and $9.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Increases in historical charge-off rates is the major reason for the increase in these combined components when comparing the allowance calculation as of December 31, 2018 to the allowance calculation as of December 31, 2017.\nAcquired loans are recorded at their fair value at acquisition date without carryover of the acquiree's previously established ALL, as credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value. The fair value of the loans is determined using market participant assumptions in estimating the amount and timing of both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and then applying a market-based discount rate to those cash flows. During evaluation upon acquisition, acquired loans are also classified as either acquired impaired or acquired performing.\nAcquired impaired loans reflect credit quality deterioration since origination, as it is probable at acquisition that the Company will not be able to collect all contractually required payments. These acquired impaired loans are accounted for under ASC 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. The acquired impaired loans are segregated into pools based on loan type and credit risk. Loan type is determined based on collateral type, purpose, and lien position. Credit risk characteristics include risk rating groups, nonaccrual status, and past due status. For valuation purposes, these pools are further disaggregated by maturity, pricing characteristics, and re-payment structure. Acquired impaired loans are written down at acquisition to fair value using an estimate of cash flows deemed to be collectible. Accordingly, such loans are no longer classified as nonaccrual even though they may be contractually past due because the Company expects to fully collect the new carrying values of such loans, which is the new cost basis arising from purchase accounting.\nAcquired performing loans are accounted for under ASC 310-20, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs. The difference between the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loan at acquisition date (premium or discount) is amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the loans. If the acquired performing loan has revolving privileges, it is accounted for using the straight-line method\u037e otherwise, the effective interest method is used.\nOverall Change in Allowance\nAs a result of management's analysis, the Company added, through the provision, $2.9 million to the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of year-end loans, was 1.31% in 2018 and 1.28% in 2017. Management believes that the allowance has been appropriately funded for losses on existing loans, based on currently available information. The Company will continue to monitor the loan portfolio and levels of nonperforming assets closely and make changes to the allowance for loan losses when necessary.\nThe following table shows an

The change in the allowance was distributed among the loan segments based on the composition of loans in each segment.

Other than time deposits, the demand deposit and money market account categories had the largest increases, totaling $9.3 million and $8.7 million, respectively. Average time deposits, which is the Company's most expensive deposit category, increased by a total of $20.7 million as seen in the table above. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits by the Company in 2018 was 0.60% compared to 0.46% in 2017.\nAs loan growth accelerated, the Company made strategic increases in the rates on time deposits in certain maturities to fund loan growth and manage its interest-rate risk. Selected money market deposit rates were also raised in 2018 to attract and retain desirable customers relationships as market and competitors' rates increased. The Company remains focused on increasing lower-cost deposits by actively targeting new noninterest-bearing deposits and savings deposits.\nThe following table shows time deposits in amounts of $100 thousand or more by time remaining until maturity at the dates presented.\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> TABLE XI\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TIME DEPOSITS OF $100,000 OR MORE\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maturing in:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Within 3 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,121\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,136\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3 through 6 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,699\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11,192\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6 through 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,820\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,830\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Greater than 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 75,689\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 76,418\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,329\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 121,576\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nTotal stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2018 was $102.0 million, up 5.83% from $96.4 million on December 31, 2017 as the increase in retained earnings and capital acquired in the Citizens acquisition offset increases in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net.\nThe Company's capital position remains strong as evidenced by the regulatory capital measurements. Under the banking regulations, Total Capital is composed of core capital (Tier 1) and supplemental capital (Tier 2). Tier 1 capital consists of common stockholders' equity less goodwill. Tier 2 capital consists of certain qualifying debt and a qualifying portion of the allowance for loan losses.\nIn June 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted the Basel III Final Rules (i) to implement the Basel III capital framework and (ii) for calculating risk-weighted assets. These rules became effective January 1, 2015, subject to limited phase-in periods. For an overview of the Basel III Final Rules, refer to Regulation and Supervision\u201d included in Item 1, Business\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's capital ratios for the past two years. As shown below, these ratios were all well above the recommended regulatory minimum levels.\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2018 Regulatory Minimums\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.59\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.28\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Leverage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.77\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.98\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear-end book value per share was $19.68 in 2018 and $19.20 in 2017. The common stock of the Company has not been extensively traded. The stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol OPOF.\u201d There were 1,635 stockholders of record of the Company as of March 12, 2019. This stockholder count does not include stockholders who hold their stock in a nominee registration.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the ability of the Company to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal funds sold, investments in securities and loans maturing within one year.\nIn addition, secondary sources are available through the use of borrowed funds if the need should arise. The Company's sources of funds include a large stable deposit base and secured advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB). As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $245.9 million in FHLB borrowing availability. As of year-end 2018 and 2017, the Company had $55.0 million and $45.0 million available in federal funds lines of credit to address any short-term borrowing needs.\nAs a result of the Company's management of liquid assets, the availability of borrowed funds and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding, management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors' requirements and to meet its customers' future borrowing needs.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, including economic conditions nationally and in the Company's markets. Depending on its liquidity levels, its capital position, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Company may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity, other securities or other possible capital markets transactions, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for the Company's operations.\nThe following table sets forth information relating to the Company's sources of liquidity and the outstanding commitments for use of liquidity at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Dividing the total short-term sources of liquidity by the outstanding commitments for use of liquidity derives the liquidity coverage ratio.\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> LIQUIDITY SOURCES AND

available-for-sale securities decreased from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 primarily due to declining balances in the securities portfolio. Unpledged available-for-sale securities also declined due to a $5.1 million increase in customer repurchase agreements. The increase in repurchase agreements from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 was primarily a result of balance fluctuations in the account of a single customer.\nManagement is not aware of any market or institutional trends, events or uncertainties that are expected to have a material effect on the liquidity, capital resources or operations of the Company. Nor is management aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that would have a material effect on liquidity or operations. The Company's internal sources of liquidity are deposits, loan and investment repayments and securities available-for-sale. The Company's primary external source of liquidity is advances from the FHLB.\nThe Company's operating activities provided $12.2 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $9.4 million provided during 2017. The Company's investing activities provided $12.0 million of cash during 2018, compared to $98.4 million used during 2017, principally due to lower loan growth. The Company's financing activities provided $3.6 million of cash during 2018 compared to $77.5 million of cash provided during 2017. This change is principally due to increases in FHLB advances in 2017.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of the Company, and other financial institutions, to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Company, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities.\nManagement believes that the key to achieving satisfactory performance in an inflationary environment is the Company's ability to maintain or improve its net interest margin and to generate additional fee income. The Company's policy of investing in and funding with interest-sensitive assets and liabilities is intended to reduce the risks inherent in a volatile inflationary economy.\nOff-Balance Sheet Lending Related Commitments\nThe Company had $147.2 million in consumer and commercial commitments at December 31, 2018. As of the same date, the Company also had $8.2 million in letters of credit that the Company will fund if certain future events occur. It is expected that only a portion of these commitments will ever actually be funded.\nManagement believes that the Company has the liquidity and capital resources to handle these commitments in the normal course of business. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the Company that will require future cash outflows. In addition, there are commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, that may or may not require future cash outflows.

Trust is a wealth management services provider. The Bank offers a complete line of consumer, mortgage and business banking services, including loan, deposit, and cash management services to individual and commercial customers. The Bank is an independent community bank and has 19 branches throughout the Hampton Roads localities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Isle of Wight County, Newport News, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg/James City County and York County.\nNet income for 2018 was $4.9 million ($0.96 per diluted share) compared to a net loss of $29 thousand (($0.01) per diluted share) in 2017. The results of 2017 included a significantly higher level of provision expense and the effect of nonrecurring charges related to the termination of the Company's defined benefit pension plan and the passage of the Tax Act.\nIn 2018, the Company's net income increased $4.9 million to net income of $4.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $29 thousand in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a reduced provision expense in 2018 and the impact of two significant nonrecurring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017. First, the Company completed the previously announced termination and settlement of its defined benefit pension plan which resulted in $2.2 million in after-tax compensation expense. Second, the changes to the corporate income tax rate resulting from the passage of the Tax Act precipitated $1.2 million in tax expenses related to the reevaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset.\nAssets as of December 31, 2018 were $1.04 billion, an increase of $56.4 million or 5.74% compared to assets as of December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Company experienced significant growth largely as a result of the Citizens acquisition, which was completed on April 1, 2018. Net loans held for investment grew $34.8 million, or 4.77%, over the year, while securities available for sale declined $8.9 million, cash and cash equivalents increased $27.8 million, and FHLB advances decreased $7.5 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company's financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company's consolidated financial position and/or results of operations. The accounting policy that required management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments is the Company's allowance for loan losses, which is described below.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on three basic principles of accounting which require: (i) that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable, (ii) that losses be accrued based on the differences between the loan balances and the value of collateral, present value of expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan's effective interest rate) or values that are observable in the secondary market and (iii) that adequate documentation exist to support the allowance for loan losses estimate.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies. Management's estimate is based on certain observable, historical data and other factors that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated. This evaluation includes credit quality trends; collateral values; discounted cash flow analysis; loan volumes; geographic, borrower and industry concentrations; the findings of internal credit quality assessments; and results from external bank regulatory examinations. These factors, as well as identified impaired loans, historical losses and current economic and business conditions, are used in developing estimated loss factors used in the calculations.\nAuthoritative accounting literature requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan's effective interest rate) or, alternatively, the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral. However, for those loans that are collateral dependent (that is, if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral) and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable, the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral. Authoritative accounting literature, as amended, also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on loans.\nFor loans not individually evaluated for impairment, the loan portfolio is segmented into pools, based on the loan classifications as defined by Schedule RC-C of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income Form 041 (Call Report) and collectively evaluated for impairment. Consumer loans not secured by real estate and made to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures are segmented into pools based on whether the loan's payments are current (including loans 1-29 days past due), 30 - 59 days past due, 60 - 89 days past due, or 90 days or more past due. All other loans, including loans to consumers that are secured by real estate, are segmented by the Company's internally assigned risk grades: substandard, other assets especially mentioned (rated just above substandard), and pass (all other loans). The Company may also assign loans to the risk grades of doubtful or loss, but as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no loans in these categories.\nSpecific reserves are determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on management's evaluation of the Company's exposure for each credit, given the current payment status of the loan and the net market value of any underlying collateral.\nWhile management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustment to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations or if required by regulators, based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates.\nLoans Acquired in a Business Combination.\nAcquired loans are classified as either (i) purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans or (ii) purchased performing loans and are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition.\nPCI loans are those for which there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. When determining fair value, PCI loans are aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics as of the date of acquisition such as loan type, date of origination, and evidence of credit quality deterioration such as internal risk grades and past due and nonaccrual status. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference\u201d and is not recorded. Any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield\u201d and is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan when there is a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of such cash flows.\nOn an annual basis, the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans is evaluated. Estimates of cash flows for PCI loans require significant judgment. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent significant increases in cash flows may result in a reversal of post-acquisition provision for loan losses or a transfer from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield that increases interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool(s) of loans. Disposals of loans, which may include sale of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in full or in part from the borrower or foreclosure of the collateral, result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan portfolio at its carrying amount.\nThe Company's PCI loans currently consist of loans acquired in connection with the acquisition of Citizens. PCI loans that were classified as nonperforming loans by Citizens are no longer classified as nonperforming so long as, at re-estimation periods, the Company is expected to fully collect the new carrying value of the pools of loans.\nThe Company accounts for purchased performing loans using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans' contractual cash flows. Purchased performing loans are recorded at fair value, including a credit discount. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. There is no allowance for loan losses established at the acquisition date for purchased performing loans. A provision for loan losses may be required for any deterioration in these loans in future periods.\nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO)\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of similar properties, length of time the properties have been held, and management's ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. The Company may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration in market conditions.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is based upon the results of operations, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses. In addition, certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Act permanently reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21% from the prior maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, companies were required to revalue their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment, with resulting tax effects accounted for in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2017, the Company recorded $1.2 million in additional tax expense based on the Company's analysis of the impact of the Tax Act.\nThe effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 5.37% and (76.98%), respectively. The effective tax rate in 2018 was positively impacted by the Tax Act, a relatively high level of tax-exempt income, and tax credits. The 2017 rate was impacted by the $3.4 million pension termination charge in 2017 which was partially offset by the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Act.\nResults of Operations\nIn 2018, the Company's net income increased $4.9 million to net income of $4.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $29 thousand in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a reduced provision for loan losses expense in 2018 and the impact of two significant nonrecurring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017. First, the Company completed the previously announced termination and settlement of its defined benefit pension plan which resulted in $2.2 million in after-tax compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. Second, the changes to the corporate income tax rate resulting from the passage of the Tax Act precipitated $1.2 million in tax expenses related to the reevaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2018 return on average assets was 0.48% compared to 0.00% in 2017 and the return on average equity was 4.93% at December 31, 2018 compared to (0.03%) in 2017.\nAssets as of December 31, 2018 were $1.04 billion, an increase of $56.4 million or 5.74% compared to assets as of December 31, 2017. During 2018, the Company experienced significant growth largely as a result of the Citizens acquisition, which was completed on April 1, 2018. Net loans held for investment grew $34.8 million, or 4.77%, over the year, while securities available for sale declined $8.9 million, cash and cash equivalents increased $27.8 million, and FHLB advances decreased $7.5 million.\nNet Interest Income\nThe principal source of earnings for the Company is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest and fees generated by earning assets and interest expense paid to fund them. Changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as their respective yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.\nNet interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, was $33.7 million in 2018, an increase of $2.8 million from 2017. The net interest margin was 3.62% in 2018 as compared to 3.64% in 2017. The increase in net interest income year-over-year was primarily due to higher average earnings assets with higher average yields outweighing higher funding costs.\nWhen comparing 2018 to 2017, the following changes occurred. Tax equivalent interest income increased $4.8 million, or 14.03%. Average earning assets increased $82.1 million, or 9.68%. Total average loans increased $95.9 million, or 14.26%, and average investment securities decreased $23.9 million, or 14.04%, as continued loan demand allowed the Company to shift its assets from securities to loans.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $71.0 million, or 11.63%, due to increases in both interest-bearing deposits and FHLB advances. FHLB advances supplemented modest growth in average deposits and provided funding to support loan growth. Total interest expense increased $2.0 million, or 64.97%, when comparing 2018 to 2017. The increase was driven by increased deposit and borrowing costs. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities in 2018 was 0.73%, an increase of 24 basis points from 2017.\nThe following table shows an analysis of average earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and rates and yields. Nonaccrual loans are included in loans outstanding.\n\n* Computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a 21% rate for 2018 and a 34% rate for 2017. The tax-equivalent adjustments to interest income were $383 thousand and $951 thousand for 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe tax-equivalent adjustment of income and yields changed in 2018 as a result of the passage of the Tax Act. The benefit of the tax-exemption for interest income from municipal bonds and loans to municipalities declined due to the decrease in the corporate income tax rate to 21%.\nThe following table summarizes changes in net interest income attributable to changes in the volume of interest-bearing assets and liabilities and changes in interest rates.\n\n* Computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a 21% rate for 2018 and a 34% rate for 2017.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. The Company's primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact the amount of interest income and expense the Company receives or pays on a significant portion of its assets and liabilities and the market value of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, excluding those which have a very short-term until maturity. Management is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the Company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk.\nThree complementary modeling techniques are utilized to measure and monitor the exposure to interest rate risk: static gap analysis, earnings simulation analysis, and economic value of equity (EVE) analysis. Static gap measures the aggregate dollar volume of rate-sensitive assets relative to rate-sensitive liabilities re-pricing over various time horizons. This metric does not effectively capture the re-pricing characteristics or embedded optionality of the Company's assets and liabilities, so it is not relied upon or addressed here. Earnings simulation measures the potential effect of changes in market interest rates on future net interest income. This analysis incorporates management's assumptions for product pricing and pre-payment expectations and is the Company's preferred tool to assess its interest rate sensitivity in the short- to medium-term. The simulation utilizes a \"static\" balance sheet approach, which assumes that management makes no changes to the composition of the balance sheet to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes. EVE modeling estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities in different interest rate environments using discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. This measure provides an indication of the future earnings capacity of the balance sheet, and the change in EVE over different rate scenarios is a measure of long-term interest rate risk. The Company places less emphasis on EVE results due to the inherent imprecision of cash flow estimations and the limited utility of a static balance sheet assumption over the long-term.\nThe Company determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments. These decisions are based on management's expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the state of the national and regional economy, and other financial and business risk factors.\nWhen the Company is liability sensitive, net interest income should improve if interest rates fall since liabilities will reprice faster than assets (depending on the optionality or prepayment speeds of the assets). Conversely, if interest rates rise, net interest income should decline. When the Company is asset sensitive, net interest income should improve if interest rates rise and fall if rates fall. The rate change model assumes that these changes will occur gradually over the course of a year.\nThe table below shows the Company's interest rate sensitivity for the periods and rate scenarios presented (dollars in thousands):\n\nManagement cannot predict future interest rates or their exact effect on net interest income. Computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain limitations are inherent in such computations. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.\nChanges in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect the Company's interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is a charge against earnings necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level consistent with management's evaluation of the portfolio. This expense is based on management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management's evaluation included credit quality trends, collateral values, discounted cash flow analysis, loan volumes, geographic, borrower and industry concentrations, the findings of internal credit quality assessments and results from external regulatory examinations. These factors, as well as identified impaired loans, historical losses and current economic and business conditions, were used in developing estimated loss factors for determining the loan loss provision. Based on its analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management concluded that the provision was appropriate.\nThe provision for loan losses was $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $4.2 million for 2017. The decline in the provision for loan losses in 2018 versus 2017 was largely due to lower levels of charge-offs and a decline in net loan growth, exclusive of the loans acquired from Citizens, which were recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, and did not carry an associated allowance for loan loss. Charged-off loans totaled $2.8 million in 2018, compared to $3.3 million in 2017. Recoveries amounted to $644 thousand in 2018 and $330 thousand in 2017. The Company's net loans charged off to average loans were 0.29% in 2018 as compared to 0.44% in 2017.\nThe state of the local economy can have a significant impact on the level of loan charge-offs. If the economy begins to contract, nonperforming assets could increase as a result of declines in real estate values and home sales or increases in unemployment rates and financial stress on borrowers. Increased nonperforming assets would increase charge-offs and reduce earnings due to larger contributions to the loan loss provision.\nNoninterest Income\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons in this section are between the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income decreased $36 thousand or 0.27% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, increases in service charges on deposits (up $283 thousand or 7.31%) were the primary driver of noninterest income growth, while 2017 noninterest income included a nonrecurring gain recognized on the acquisition of Old Point Mortgage, LLC.\nAside from the increase in service charges on deposits and impact of the nonrecurring gain, the other primary increases in noninterest income were other service charges, commissions and fees (up $116 thousand or 3.38%), and mortgage banking income (up $143 thousand or 22.17%). The growth in the service charges on deposit accounts category was related to fees for nonsufficient fund item processing. Other service charges, commissions and fees increased primarily due to growth in merchant processing income. Mortgage banking income increased as a result of the acquisition of Old Point Mortgage.\nThe Company continues to focus on diversifying noninterest income through efforts to expand Trust, insurance, and mortgage banking activities, and a continued focus on business checking and other corporate services.\nNoninterest Expense\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons in this section are between the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's noninterest expense decreased $695 thousand or 1.77%. Exclusive of the pension termination charge of $3.4 million in 2017, noninterest expense was elevated in 2018 due to merger costs, increased salary and employee benefits in part associated with increased staff related to acquisition growth, FDIC insurance costs, data processing and professional services costs related to process improvement initiatives.\nOf the remaining categories of noninterest expense, the most significant changes when comparing 2018 to 2017 were in occupancy and equipment and loss (gain) on other real estate owned.\n \u00b7 Occupancy and equipment (increased $157 thousand or 2.68%): Occupancy expense related to the Citizens acquisition and service contracts for equipment costs were the main increases. \n \u00b7 Loss (gain) on other real estate owned (increased $104 thousand or (577.78%)): The Company recorded a small gain on the final sales of OREO previously written down in 2017, as compared to a net loss in 2018 related to one property acquired into OREO and sold in 2018. \nThe provision for income taxes is based upon the results of operations, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income, non-deductible expenses, and tax credits. In addition, certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Act permanently reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21% from the prior maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, companies were required to revalue their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment, with resulting tax effects accounted for in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2017, the Company recorded $1.2 million in additional tax expense based on the Company's analysis of the impact of the Tax Act.\nThe effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 5.4% and (77.0%), respectively. The effective tax rate in 2018 was positively impacted by the Tax Act and a relatively high level of tax-exempt income and tax credits. The 2017 rate was impacted by the $3.4 million pension charge in 2017 partially offset by the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Act.\nBalance Sheet Review\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $1.04 billion, an increase of $56.4 million or 5.74% compared to assets as of December 31, 2017.\nAsset growth in 2018 was driven primarily by the acquisition of Citizens. Net loans held for investment increased $34.8 million or 4.77%, from $729.1 million at December 31, 2017 to $763.9 million at December 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents increased $27.8 million or 192.93% from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, and securities available for sale decreased $8.9 million or 5.65% over the same period. Total deposits increased $59.6 million or 7.60% in 2018.\nOn April 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Citizens. Below is a summary of the transaction and related impact on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \u00b7 The fair value of assets acquired equaled $50.4 million and the fair value of liabilities assumed equaled $44.3 million. \n \u00b7 Loans held for investment acquired totaled $42.8 million, as acquired and at fair value. \n \u00b7 Total deposits assumed totaled $43.8 million with a fair value of $44.0 million. \n \u00b7 Total goodwill arising from the transaction equaled $1.0 million. \n \u00b7 Core deposit intangibles acquired totaled $440 thousand. \nSecurities Portfolio\nWhen comparing December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017, securities available-for-sale decreased $8.9 million, or 5.65%. The vast majority of the decline was due to principal curtailments on mortgage-backed securities and calls and maturities of other securities, principally tax-exempt municipal bonds.\nThe Company's strategy for the securities portfolio is primarily intended to manage the portfolio's susceptibility to interest rate risk and to provide liquidity to fund loan growth. The securities portfolio is also adjusted to achieve other asset/liability objectives, including pledging requirements, and to manage tax exposure when necessary.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the securities portfolio:\n\nThe following table summarizes the contractual maturity of the securities portfolio and their weighted average yields as of December 31, 2018:\n\nThe table above is based on maturity. Therefore, it does not reflect cash flow from principal payments or prepayments prior to maturity. The weighted average life of the $71.2 million in mortgage-backed securities as of December 31, 2018 was 4.20 years. Yields are calculated on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a 21% rate.\nLoan Portfolio\nThe following table shows a breakdown of total loans by segment at December 31 for years 2014 through 2018:\n TABLE V LOAN PORTFOLIO As of December 31, (in thousands) Commercial $ 63,398 $ 60,398 $ 54,434 $ 43,197 $ 37,698 Real estate-construction 32,383 27,489 23,116 19,685 9,082 Real estate-mortgage (1) 500,441 465,231 448,408 437,159 435,914 Consumer 169,138 174,225 58,907 50,427 30,493 Other 8,649 11,197 19,017 18,007 22,807 Total $ 774,009 $ 738,540 $ 603,882 $ 568,475 $ 535,994 (1) The real estate-mortgage segment includes residential 1 - 4 family, commercial real estate, second mortgages and equity lines of credit. \nBased on the North American Industry Classification System code, there are no categories of loans that exceed 10% of total loans other than the categories disclosed in the preceding table.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the total loan portfolio increased by $35.5 million or 4.80% from December 31, 2017 with the growth of its loan portfolio in 2018 attributed in large part to the Citizens acquisition. The Citizens portfolio mainly focused on commercial real estate, construction, and commercial and industrial lending. 2017 loan growth was aided significantly by growth in the indirect dealer lending division.\nThe maturity distribution and rate sensitivity of certain categories of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 is presented below:\n\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest, nonperforming restructured loans, and other real estate owned (OREO). Restructured loans are loans with terms that were modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report Form 10-K for more information.\nNonperforming assets decreased by $1.3 million or 8.36%, from $16.1 million at December 31, 2017 to $14.7 million at December 31, 2018. The 2018 total consisted of $2.5 million in loans still accruing interest but past due 90 days or more and $12.1 million in nonaccrual loans. Of the $12.1 million in nonaccrual loans, $11.8 million was secured by real estate. All of the nonaccrual loans are classified as impaired. Impaired loans are a component of the allowance for loan losses. When a loan changes from 90 days past due but still accruing interest\u201d to nonaccrual\u201d status, the loan is normally reviewed for impairment. If impairment is identified, then the Company records a charge-off based on the value of the collateral or the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. If the Company is waiting on an appraisal to determine the collateral's value, management allocates funds to cover the deficiency to the allowance for loan losses based on information available to management at the time.\nThe recorded investment in impaired loans decreased to $16.2 million as of December 31, 2018 from $18.5 million as of December 31, 2017 as detailed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K. The majority of these loans were collateralized.\nThe following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of nonperforming assets, which includes nonaccrual loans, past due loans, TDRs and OREO:\n\n(1) The real estate-mortgage segment includes residential 1 - 4 family, commercial real estate, second mortgages and equity lines of credit.\n(2) Amounts listed include student loans with principal and interest amounts that are 97 - 98% guaranteed by the federal government. The past due principal portion of these guaranteed loans totaled $1.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $2.3 million at December 31, 2017. For additional information, refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report on Form 10-K.\n(3) Amounts listed represent restructured loans that are in compliance with their modified terms as of the date presented.\nAs shown in the table above, as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, the nonaccrual loan category decreased by $741 thousand or 5.75% and the 90-days past due and still accruing interest category decreased by $685 thousand or 21.53%.\nThe majority of the balance of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018 was related to a few large credit relationships. Of the $12.1 million of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018, $9.4 million, or approximately 77.25%, was comprised of four credit relationships. All loans in these relationships have been analyzed to determine whether the cash flow of the borrower and the collateral pledged to secure the loans is sufficient to cover outstanding principal balances. The Company has set aside specific allocations for those loans without sufficient cash flow or collateral and charged off any balance that management does not expect to collect.\nThe majority of the loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31, 2018 ($1.7 million) were student loans. The federal government has provided guarantees of repayment of these student loans in an amount ranging from 97% to 98% of the total principal and interest of the loans; as such, management does not expect even a significant increase in past due student loans to have a material effect on the Company.\nManagement believes the Company has excellent credit quality review processes in place to identify problem loans quickly. For a detailed discussion of the Company's nonperforming assets, refer to Note 5 and Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on several components. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance, each segment of the loan portfolio is divided into several pools of loans:\n 1. Specific identification (regardless of risk rating) \n 2. Pool-substandard \n 3. Pool-other assets especially mentioned (OAEM) (rated just above substandard) \n 4. Pool-pass loans (all other rated loans) \nThe first component of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on specifically identified loans that may become impaired. These loans are individually analyzed for impairment and include nonperforming loans and both performing and nonperforming TDRs. This component may also include loans considered impaired for other reasons, such as outdated financial information on the borrower or guarantors or financial problems of the borrower, including operating losses, marginal working capital, inadequate cash flow, or business interruptions. Changes in TDRs and nonperforming loans affect the dollar amount of the allowance. Increases in the impairment allowance for TDRs and nonperforming loans are reflected as an increase in the allowance for loan losses except in situations where the TDR or nonperforming loan does not require a specific allocation (i.e., the discounted present value of expected future cash flows or the collateral value is considered sufficient).\nThe majority of the Company's TDRs and nonperforming loans are collateralized by real estate. When reviewing loans for impairment, the Company obtains current appraisals when applicable. If the Company has not yet received a current appraisal on loans being reviewed for impairment, any loan balance that is in excess of the estimated appraised value is allocated in the allowance. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the impaired loan component of the allowance for loan losses amounted to $116 thousand and $95 thousand, respectively. The impaired loan component of the allowance for loan losses is reflected as a valuation allowance related to impaired loans in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nThe second component of the allowance consists of qualitative factors and includes items such as economic conditions, growth trends, loan concentrations, changes in certain loans, changes in underwriting, changes in management and legal and regulatory changes. For the December 31, 2018 calculation, the qualitative factors which had the most significant impact on the allowance were those affected by changes in the economy and past due and nonaccrual loans. Continued incremental improvements in the economy allowed for a reduction in the allowance. At the same time, past due and nonaccrual loans increased in several categories when comparing December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2017.\nHistorical loss is the final component of the allowance for loan losses. The calculation of the historical loss component is conducted on loans evaluated collectively for impairment and uses migration analysis with eight migration periods covering twelve quarters each on pooled segments for both 2018 and 2017. These segments are based on the loan classifications set by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council in the instructions for the Call Report applicable to the Bank.\nConsumer loans not secured by real estate and made to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures are segmented into pools based on whether the loan's payments are current (including loans 1 - 29 days past due), 30 - 59 days past due, 60 - 89 days past due, or 90 days or more past due. All other loans, including loans to consumers that are secured by real estate, are segmented by the Company's internally assigned risk grades: substandard, other assets especially mentioned (rated just above substandard), and pass (all other loans). The Company may also assign loans to the risk grades of doubtful or loss, but as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no loans in these categories.\nThe calculation for December 31, 2018 and 2017 was based on eight migration periods covering twelve quarters each. On a combined basis, the historical loss and qualitative factor components amounted to $10.0 million and $9.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Increases in historical charge-off rates is the major reason for the increase in these combined components when comparing the allowance calculation as of December 31, 2018 to the allowance calculation as of December 31, 2017.\nAcquired loans are recorded at their fair value at acquisition date without carryover of the acquiree's previously established ALL, as credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value. The fair value of the loans is determined using market participant assumptions in estimating the amount and timing of both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and then applying a market-based discount rate to those cash flows. During evaluation upon acquisition, acquired loans are also classified as either acquired impaired or acquired performing.\nAcquired impaired loans reflect credit quality deterioration since origination, as it is probable at acquisition that the Company will not be able to collect all contractually required payments. These acquired impaired loans are accounted for under ASC 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. The acquired impaired loans are segregated into pools based on loan type and credit risk. Loan type is determined based on collateral type, purpose, and lien position. Credit risk characteristics include risk rating groups, nonaccrual status, and past due status. For valuation purposes, these pools are further disaggregated by maturity, pricing characteristics, and re-payment structure. Acquired impaired loans are written down at acquisition to fair value using an estimate of cash flows deemed to be collectible. Accordingly, such loans are no longer classified as nonaccrual even though they may be contractually past due because the Company expects to fully collect the new carrying values of such loans, which is the new cost basis arising from purchase accounting.\nAcquired performing loans are accounted for under ASC 310-20, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs. The difference between the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loan at acquisition date (premium or discount) is amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the loans. If the acquired performing loan has revolving privileges, it is accounted for using the straight-line method\u037e otherwise, the effective interest method is used.\nOverall Change in Allowance\nAs a result of management's analysis, the Company added, through the provision, $2.9 million to the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of year-end loans, was 1.31% in 2018 and 1.28% in 2017. Management believes that the allowance has been appropriately funded for losses on existing loans, based on currently available information. The Company will continue to monitor the loan portfolio and levels of nonperforming assets closely and make changes to the allowance for loan losses when necessary.\nThe following table shows an analysis of the allowance for loan losses:\n\n(1) The real estate-mortgage segment includes residential 1 - 4 family, commercial real estate, second mortgages and equity lines of credit.\n(2) Income before taxes plus provision for loan losses, divided by net charge-offs.\nThe following table shows the amount of the allowance for loan losses allocated to each category at December 31 of the years presented. Although the allowance for loan losses is allocated into these categories, the entire allowance for loan losses is available to cover loan losses in any category.\n\n(1) The real estate-mortgage segment includes residential 1 - 4 family, commercial real estate, second mortgages and equity lines of credit.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, there was an increase in the allowance for loan losses due to increases in the historical charge-off rate in the loan portfolio. The change in the allowance was distributed among the loan segments based on the composition of loans in each segment. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K for further information related to the effect of the change in the calculation method.\nDeposits\nThe following table shows the average balances and average rates paid on deposits for the periods presented.\n\nThe Company's average total deposits were $822.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $43.7 million or 5.61% from average total deposits for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other than time deposits, the demand deposit and money market account categories had the largest increases, totaling $9.3 million and $8.7 million, respectively. Average time deposits, which is the Company's most expensive deposit category, increased by a total of $20.7 million as seen in the table above. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits by the Company in 2018 was 0.60% compared to 0.46% in 2017.\nAs loan growth accelerated, the Company made strategic increases in the rates on time deposits in certain maturities to fund loan growth and manage its interest-rate risk. Selected money market deposit rates were also raised in 2018 to attract and retain desirable customers relationships as market and competitors' rates increased. The Company remains focused on increasing lower-cost deposits by actively targeting new noninterest-bearing deposits and savings deposits.\nThe following table shows time deposits in amounts of $100 thousand or more by time remaining until maturity at the dates presented.\n\nCapital Resources\nTotal stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2018 was $102.0 million, up 5.83% from $96.4 million on December 31, 2017 as the increase in retained earnings and capital acquired in the Citizens acquisition offset increases in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net.\nThe Company's capital position remains strong as evidenced by the regulatory capital measurements. Under the banking regulations, Total Capital is composed of core capital (Tier 1) and supplemental capital (Tier 2). Tier 1 capital consists of common stockholders' equity less goodwill. Tier 2 capital consists of certain qualifying debt and a qualifying portion of the allowance for loan losses.\nIn June 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted the Basel III Final Rules (i) to implement the Basel III capital framework and (ii) for calculating risk-weighted assets. These rules became effective January 1, 2015, subject to limited phase-in periods. For an overview of the Basel III Final Rules, refer to Regulation and Supervision\u201d included in Item 1, Business\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's capital ratios for the past two years. As shown below, these ratios were all well above the recommended regulatory minimum levels.\n\nYear-end book value per share was $19.68 in 2018 and $19.20 in 2017. The common stock of the Company has not been extensively traded. The stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol OPOF.\u201d There were 1,635 stockholders of record of the Company as of March 12, 2019. This stockholder count does not include stockholders who hold their stock in a nominee registration.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the ability of the Company to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal funds sold, investments in securities and loans maturing within one year.\nIn addition, secondary sources are available through the use of borrowed funds if the need should arise. The Company's sources of funds include a large stable deposit base and secured advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB). As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $245.9 million in FHLB borrowing availability. As of year-end 2018 and 2017, the Company had $55.0 million and $45.0 million available in federal funds lines of credit to address any short-term borrowing needs.\nAs a result of the Company's management of liquid assets, the availability of borrowed funds and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding, management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors' requirements and to meet its customers' future borrowing needs.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, including economic conditions nationally and in the Company's markets. Depending on its liquidity levels, its capital position, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Company may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity, other securities or other possible capital markets transactions, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for the Company's operations.\nThe following table sets forth information relating to the Company's sources of liquidity and the outstanding commitments for use of liquidity at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Dividing the total short-term sources of liquidity by the outstanding commitments for use of liquidity derives the liquidity coverage ratio.\n\nThe fair value of unpledged available-for-sale securities decreased from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 primarily due to declining balances in the securities portfolio. Unpledged available-for-sale securities also declined due to a $5.1 million increase in customer repurchase agreements. The increase in repurchase agreements from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 was primarily a result of balance fluctuations in the account of a single customer.\nManagement is not aware of any market or institutional trends, events or uncertainties that are expected to have a material effect on the liquidity, capital resources or operations of the Company. Nor is management aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that would have a material effect on liquidity or operations. The Company's internal sources of liquidity are deposits, loan and investment repayments and securities available-for-sale. The Company's primary external source of liquidity is advances from the FHLB.\nThe Company's operating activities provided $12.2 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $9.4 million provided during 2017. The Company's investing activities provided $12.0 million of cash during 2018, compared to $98.4 million used during 2017, principally due to lower loan growth. The Company's financing activities provided $3.6 million of cash during 2018 compared to $77.5 million of cash provided during 2017. This change is principally due to increases in FHLB advances in 2017.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of the Company, and other financial institutions, to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Company, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities.\nManagement believes that the key to achieving satisfactory performance in an inflationary environment is the Company's ability to maintain or improve its net interest margin and to generate additional fee income. The Company's policy of investing in and funding with interest-sensitive assets and liabilities is intended to reduce the risks inherent in a volatile inflationary economy.\nOff-Balance Sheet Lending Related Commitments\nThe Company had $147.2 million in consumer and commercial commitments at December 31, 2018. As of the same date, the Company also had $8.2 million in letters of credit that the Company will fund if certain future events occur. It is expected that only a portion of these commitments will ever actually be funded.\nManagement believes that the Company has the liquidity and capital resources to handle these commitments in the normal course of business. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the Company that will require future cash outflows. In addition, there are commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, that may or may not require future cash outflows. The following table provides the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\n\nShort-term debt obligations include federal funds purchased, overnight repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank advances maturing within a year of origination. Long-term debt obligations consist of Federal Home Loan Bank advances with original maturities greater than one year.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nCertain short-term borrowings at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented below. Information is presented only on those categories whose average balance at December 31 exceeded 30 percent of total stockholders' equity at the same date.\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 19: <table> <tr>

analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for a company, which includes the parent company and its subsidiaries, the Bank and Trust. It addresses the following key points:\n\n1. **Liquidity and Capital Resources**: The company maintains strong liquidity and capital resources. It has access to significant short-term funding sources, including federal funds lines of credit and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Its liquidity coverage ratio, which measures available short-term funding sources against potential short-term funding uses, exceeds 500%.\n\n2. **Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Lending Related Commitments**: The company has contractual obligations, including short-term and long-term debt, and operating lease obligations. There are also unfunded loan commitments and lending lines of credit, and letters of credit. The company also actively manages its loans and deposits, and it does not anticipate any significant challenges that could materially impact liquidity or operations.\n\n3. **Capital Ratios**: The company's capital ratios are well above the regulatory minimums, indicating a strong capital position. The company has a total capital ratio significantly higher than the 8% regulatory minimum.\n\n4. **Deposits**: Total deposits have increased, with an emphasis on increasing lower-cost deposits such as noninterest-bearing deposits and savings deposits.\n\n5. **Loan Portfolio**: The company experienced growth in its loan portfolio, partly attributable to an acquisition. All loan categories were performing well except for certain large credit relationships specified as nonaccrual loans.\n\n6. **Allowance for Loan Losses**: The allowance for loan losses increased due to higher historical charge-off rates. The allowance is considered adequately funded to cover the current level of probable incurred losses.\n\n7. **Short-Term Borrowings**: The company has managed its short-term borrowings well, consisting of federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.\n\n8. **Interest Rate Sensitivity and Asset Quality**: The company discusses its strategy for managing interest rate sensitivity and the quality of assets. Asset quality is actively managed with robust credit quality review processes.\n\n9. **Effects of Inflation**: The company's financial condition is more affected by interest rate changes than inflation. Its strategy is to maintain or improve the net interest margin and generate additional fee income to cope with inflation.\n\n10. **Forward-Looking Statements**: The report contains forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions and subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.\n\nThe MD&A section serves to give investors a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and risk management strategies. The detailed section related to the allowance for loan losses and loan portfolio provides insight into the company's credit risk management and expectations for potential losses. Overall, the report signals the company's stable financial position while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in forward-looking projections."}
