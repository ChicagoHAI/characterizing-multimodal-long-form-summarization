We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In November 2016, we closed our continuous public offering of common shares to new investors.\nOur investment activities are managed by FS/EIG Advisor and supervised by our board of trustees, a majority of whom are independent. Under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement, we have agreed to pay FS/EIG Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average weekly value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. Our investment activities were managed by FS Advisor until April 9, 2018 and thereafter have been managed by FS/EIG Advisor. FS Advisor previously engaged GSO Capital Partners LP, or GSO, to act as our investment sub-advisor. GSO resigned as our investment sub-advisor and terminated the investment sub-advisory agreement dated April 28, 2011, or the investment sub-advisory agreement, that FS Advisor had entered into with GSO, effective April 9, 2018.\nOur investment policy is to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of our total assets in securities of Energy companies. This investment policy may not be changed without at least 60 days' prior notice to holders of our common shares of any such change.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. We pursue our investment objective by focusing on the following seven investment themes: (i) basin-on-basin competition in U.S. shale, (ii) globalization of natural gas, (iii) coal retirements and the evolving energy generation mix, (iv) renewables focused on power grid parity, (v) export infrastructure for emerging U.S. producers, (vi) market liberalization opening new markets and (vii) midstream infrastructure connecting new supplies. However, we may pursue other investment opportunities if we believe it is in our best interests and consistent with our investment objectives.\nWithin the above investment themes, we intend to focus on the following investment categories in an effort to generate returns for our investors with an acceptable level of risk.\nDirect Originations: Through FS/EIG Advisor, we intend to directly source investment opportunities across the Energy industry. Such investments are typically originated and structured through a negotiated process in which we directly participate and are not generally available to the broader market. These investments may include both debt and equity components. We believe directly originated investments may offer higher returns and more favorable protections than broadly syndicated transactions.\nBroadly Syndicated Loan and Bond Transactions: Although our primary focus is to invest in directly originated transactions, in certain circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield bond markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and provide a complement to our less liquid strategies.\nIn the case of broadly syndicated investments, we generally intend to capitalize on market inefficiencies by investing in loans, bonds, and other asset classes where the market price of such investment reflects a lower\nvalue than we believe is warranted based on our fundamental analysis, providing us with an opportunity to earn an attractive return on our investment.\nOur portfolio is comprised primarily of income-oriented securities, which principally refers to debt securities and income-oriented preferred and common equity interests, of privately-held Energy companies within the United States. We expect to invest primarily in directly originated investments and primary market transactions, as this will provide us with the ability to tailor investments to best match a project's or company's needs with our investment objectives. We intend to weight our portfolio towards senior secured debt and directly originated preferred equity investments, which we believe offer opportunities for superior risk-adjusted returns and income generation. Our debt investments may take the form of corporate or project loans or bonds, may be secured or unsecured and may, in some cases, be accompanied by yield enhancements. These yield enhancements are typically expected to include royalty interests in mineral, oil and gas properties, warrants, options, net profits interests, cash flow participations or other forms of equity participation that can provide additional consideration or upside\u201d in a transaction. Our preferred equity investments are mostly directly originated and may take the form of perpetual or redeemable securities, typically with a current income component and minimum base returns. In addition, certain income-oriented preferred or common equity interests may include interests in master limited partnerships and a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of derivatives, including the use of total return swaps, credit default swaps and other commodity swap contracts. In connection with certain of our debt investments or any restructuring of these debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests, including warrants or options, as additional consideration or otherwise in connection with a restructuring. FS/EIG Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve.\nRevenues\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net realized gain or loss on swap contracts, net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments, net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency investments and net change in unrealized gain or loss on swap contracts. Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Net realized gain or loss on swap contracts is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to the difference between the fixed price specified in the contract and the referenced settlement price. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investments. Net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Net change in unrealized gain or loss on swap contracts is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of the difference between the fixed price specified in the contract and the referenced settlement price.\nWe principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. We also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we may hold. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate FS/EIG Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments.\nFS/EIG Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. FS/EIG Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FS/EIG Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.\nWe reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FS/EIG Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and EIG providing administrative services to us on behalf of FS/EIG Advisor, and for transactional expenses for prospective investments, such as fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of investments that do not close, often referred to as broken deal\u201d costs. We reimburse FS/EIG Advisor no less than quarterly for all costs and expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in performing its obligations and providing personnel under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (1) FS/EIG Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that we estimate would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS/EIG Advisor allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as time allocations and other reasonable metrics. Our board of trustees reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of trustees considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of trustees compares the total amount paid to FS/EIG Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FS/EIG Advisor.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\n\u2022\ncorporate and organization expenses related to offerings of our common shares, subject to limitations included in the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement;\n\u2022\nthe cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party pricing or valuation services;\n\u2022\nthe cost of effecting sales and repurchases of our common shares and other securities;\n\u2022\ninvestment advisory fees;\n\u2022\nfees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n\u2022\ninterest payments on our debt or related obligations;\n\u2022\ntransfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022\nresearch and market data (including news and quotation equipment and services, and any computer hardware and connectivity hardware (e.g. telephone and fiber optic lines) incorporated into the cost of obtaining such research and market data);\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nfederal and state registration fees;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022\nannual fees of the Delaware trustee;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses of our trustees not also serving in an executive officer capacity for us or FS/EIG Advisor;\n\u2022\ncosts of proxy statements, shareholders' reports and notices and other filings;\n\u2022\nour fidelity bond, trustees and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n\u2022\ndirect costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with accounting, corporate governance, government and regulatory affairs activities, independent audits and outside legal costs;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nbrokerage commissions for our investments;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our chief compliance officer; and\n\u2022\nall other expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in performing administrative services for us and administrative personnel paid by FS/EIG Advisor, to the extent they are not controlling persons of FS/EIG Advisor or any of its affiliates, subject to the limitations included in the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement.\nIn addition, we have contracted with State Street to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by FS/EIG Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.\nFor information regarding our fee offset and historical expense reimbursement arrangements with FS Investments and FS/EIG Advisor, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nQualifying Assets\nUnder the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of our total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:\n1.\nSecurities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:\na.\nis organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;\nb.\nis not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and\nc.\nsatisfies any of the following:\ni.\ndoes not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;\nii.\nhas a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;\niii.\nis controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or\niv.\nis a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million.\n2.\nSecurities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.\n3.\nSecurities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.\n4.\nSecurities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.\n5.\nSecurities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.\n6.\nCash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u2009-\u2009Risks Related to Business Development Companies\u2009-\u2009The requirement that we invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets could preclude us from investing in accordance with our current business strategy; conversely, the failure to invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets could result in our failure to maintain our status as a BDC.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2020, 67.6% of our total assets constituted qualifying assets. Therefore, until qualifying assets represent at least 70% of our total assets, we may not make investments other than in qualifying assets. Pending investments in other types of qualifying assets,\u201d we may hold cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.\nCOVID-19 and Energy Market Developments\nRecent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, global lockdowns and ongoing negotiations regarding production levels between oil producing countries, has resulted in lower demand for crude oil and, as a result, lower commodity prices. The impact of these events on the U.S. and global economies (including energy markets), has negatively impacted, and is likely to continue to negatively impact, the business operations of some of our portfolio companies. We cannot at this time fully predict the continued impact of these events on our business or the business of our portfolio companies, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they will negatively impact our portfolio companies' operating results or our own results of operations or financial condition. We expect that certain of our portfolio companies will continue to experience economic distress for the foreseeable future and may become insolvent or otherwise significantly limit business operations if subjected to prolonged economic distress, including as a result of the depressed price of oil or other declines in the energy markets. These developments could result in a further decrease in the value of our investments.\nThese events have already had adverse effects on our investment income and we expect that such adverse effects will continue for some time. These adverse effects have required and may again require us to require us to restructure certain of our investments, which could result in further reductions to our investment income or in impairments on our investments. In addition, disruptions in the capital markets have resulted in illiquidity in certain market areas. These market disruptions and illiquidity have had and are likely to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unfavorable economic conditions caused by these events can also be expected to increase our funding costs and limit our access to the capital markets. These events have limited our investment originations, which is likely to continue for the immediate future, and have also had a material negative impact on our operating results. In addition, depressed mark-to-market valuations of many of our portfolio companies have materially reduced the value of collateral available to secure our financing arrangements. Consequently, this has\nadversely impacted our liquidity, may cause us to fall out of compliance with certain portfolio requirements under the 1940 Act that are tied to the value of our investments and, in each case, may continue to do so in the future.\nIn particular, as a result of these events, we have needed to sell certain investments to satisfy certain margin obligations, and if current market conditions persist or worsen, we may need to sell additional investments at similarly or even more disadvantageous prices, or enter into other transactions on terms that are disadvantageous to us, to satisfy obligations under our financing arrangements.\nIn light of such difficult market conditions and in an effort to preserve our liquidity, we previously determined to suspend for an indefinite period of time our share repurchase program and will reassess our ability to recommence such program in future periods. Moreover, while our board of trustees declared three cash distributions, each in the amount of $0.03 per share, which were paid on July 10, 2020, October 12, 2020 and January 12, 2021, it has not declared or resumed regular cash distributions to shareholders for any period after March 31, 2020, and we expect that future regular cash distributions to shareholders will be suspended until such time that we believe that market conditions and our financial condition support the resumption of such distributions. Our board of trustees has and will continue to evaluate our ability to pay any distributions in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions in the future.\nWe will continue to carefully monitor the impact of both the COVID-19 pandemic and disruptions in the energy markets on our business and the business of our portfolio companies. Because the full effects of these events are not capable of being known at this time, we cannot estimate the impacts on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do, however, expect that these events will continue to have a negative impact on our business and the financial condition of our portfolio companies.\nPortfolio Investment Activity for the Years

Our board of trustees has and will continue to evaluate our ability to pay any distributions in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions in the future and any annualized distribution rate provided in this report may not be representative of the actual distribution rate for any period. Based on the distributions declared during 2020 of $0.1733 per share, and the price at which we issued shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan of $3.30 per share as of December 31, 2020, the annualized distribution rate to shareholders as of December 31, 2020 was 5.25%. Based on our regular monthly cash distribution rate of $0.041667 per share as of December 31, 2019, and the price at which we issued shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan of $5.50 per share, the annualized distribution rate to shareholders as of December 31, 2019 was 9.09%.

Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.\nThe level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We may experience volatility in the amount of interest income that we earn as the accrual status of existing portfolio investments may fluctuate due to ongoing restructuring activity in the portfolio. The decrease in the amount of interest income and PIK income for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to a combination of factors including an overall decrease in the size of the investment portfolio, certain investments being placed on non-accrual and an increase in the portfolio's allocation to non-income producing assets as a result of restructurings. The increase in the amount of interest income and PIK income for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to a combination of factors including an increase in the size of our directly originated investments and structured preferred equity investments in addition to higher yields in certain of our investments.\nFee income is transaction based, and typically consists of prepayment fees and structuring fees. As such, future fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of\nevents at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees. The decrease in the amount of fee income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the decrease of origination and prepayment activity during the period.\nExpenses\nOur operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by the decline in Energy markets and performance of certain upstream and common equity investments. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by the decline in Energy markets in the fourth quarter and performance of our directly originated investments.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $(874,785) ($(2.00) per share), $(37,123) ($(0.08) per share) and $(60,342) ($(0.14) per share), respectively.\nThis Results of Operations\u201d section should be read in conjunction with COVID-19 and Energy Market Developments\u201d above.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $142,536 in cash, which we held in custodial accounts. As of December 31, 2020, we also had broadly syndicated investments that could be sold to create additional\nliquidity. As of December 31, 2020, we had three senior secured loan investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $19,403 and an unfunded commitment of $2,234 to contribute capital to Sustainable Infrastructure Investments, LLC. We maintain sufficient cash on hand and/or liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nWe generate cash primarily from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan and from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS/EIG Advisor, but unless and until we elect otherwise, as permitted by the 1940 Act, in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See - Financing Arrangements.\u201d\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the net proceeds from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan as well as from sales and paydowns of existing investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nIn light of difficult market conditions, we took several steps during the year to seek to enhance our liquidity by, among other things, suspending our share repurchase program, suspending regular cash distributions and reducing leverage by paying down borrowings. In addition, FS/EIG Advisor deferred the payment of a portion of the management fee to which it was entitled for investment advisory services provided during the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, though FS/EIG Advisor has since received the deferred fees. We believe the net result of such measures resulted in an improved liquidity position for us.\nThis Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section should be read in conjunction with COVID-19 and Energy Market Developments\u201d above and - Financing Arrangements\u201d below.\nFinancing Arrangements\nThe following table presents a summary of information with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\nArrangement(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nType of\nArrangement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nRate(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\nOutstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\nAvailable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMaturity Date\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJPMorgan Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nRevolving/Term\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nL+3.00%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>416,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFebruary 16, 2023\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSenior Secured Notes(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nBond\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7.50%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>489,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAugust 15, 2023\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>905,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nThe carrying amount outstanding under the facility approximates its fair value, unless otherwise noted.\n(2)\nLIBOR is subject to a 0.00% floor.\n(3)\nAs of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Senior Secured Notes was approximately $473,166.\nFor additional information regarding our financing arrangements, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRIC Tax Treatment and Distributions\nWe have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each tax year, dividends generally of an amount at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income,\u201d which is generally the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined\nwithout regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we may, in certain cases, satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement by distributing dividends relating to a tax year after the close of such tax year under the spillover dividend\u201d provisions of Subchapter M of the Code. If we distribute a spillover dividend, such dividend will be included in a shareholder's gross income for the tax year in which the spillover distribution is paid. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our shareholders to maintain our RIC tax treatment each tax year. We will also be subject to nondeductible U.S. federal excise taxes on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner to our shareholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary taxable income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains over capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to our shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. shareholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared.\nIn general, when we pay regular cash distributions, we intend to declare them on a quarterly or monthly basis and pay them on a monthly basis. We will calculate each shareholder's specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each shareholder's distributions will begin to accrue on the date that common shares are issued to such shareholder. From time to time, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees.\nOur distribution proceeds have exceeded and in the future may exceed our earnings. Therefore, portions of the distributions that we have made represented, and may make in the future may represent, a return of capital to shareholders, which lowers their tax basis in their common shares. A return of capital generally is a return of an investor's investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with our continuous public offering, including any fees payable to FS/EIG Advisor. Moreover, a return of capital will generally not be taxable, but will reduce each shareholder's cost basis in our common shares, and will result in a higher reported capital gain or lower reported capital loss when the common shares on which such return of capital was received are sold. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders.\nWe intend to make any regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution, unless shareholders elect to receive their cash distributions in additional common shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. shareholder.\nWhile our board of trustees declared three cash distributions in 2020, each in the amount of $0.03 per share, which were paid on July 10, 2020, October 12, 2020 and January 12, 2021, they have not declared or resumed regular cash distributions to shareholders for any period after March 31, 2020, and FS/EIG Advisor and our board of trustees expect that future regular cash distributions to shareholders will be suspended until such time that our board of trustees and FS/EIG Advisor believe that market conditions and our financial condition support the resumption of such distributions. Our board of trustees has and will continue to evaluate our ability to pay any distributions in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions in the future.\nThe following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we have declared on our common shares during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nDistribution\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nPer Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.5000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.5000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>218,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nDistribution\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nPer Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.1733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our distributions, including a reconciliation of our GAAP-basis net investment income to our tax-basis net investment income, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis and deferred taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. We have identified one of our accounting policies, valuation of portfolio investments, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nWe determine the fair value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of trustees. In connection with that determination, FS/EIG Advisor provides our board of trustees with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party valuation services.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n\u2022\nour quarterly fair valuation process begins with FS/EIG Advisor reviewing and documenting preliminary valuations of each portfolio company or investment;\n\u2022\nsuch preliminary valuations for each portfolio company or investment are compared to a valuation range that is obtained from an independent third-party valuation service;\n\u2022\nFS/EIG Advisor then provides the valuation committee of our board of trustees, or the valuation committee, its valuation recommendation for each portfolio company or investment, along with supporting materials;\n\u2022\npreliminary valuations are then discussed with the valuation committee;\n\u2022\nthe valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations and FS/EIG Advisor, together with our independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee;\n\u2022\nfollowing its review, the valuation committee will recommend that our board of trustees approve our fair valuations; and\n\u2022\nour board of trustees discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each such investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of FS/EIG Advisor, the valuation committee and any independent third-party valuation services, if applicable.\nDetermination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, our board of trustees may use any approved independent third-party pricing or valuation services. However, our board of trustees is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information obtained from FS/ EIG Advisor or any approved independent third-party valuation or pricing service that our board of trustees deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that FS/EIG Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may consider when determining the fair value of our investments.\nValuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, we may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the portfolio company in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing our debt investments.\nFor convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used.\nOur equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Our board of trustees, in its determination of fair value, may consider various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value, PV-10 multiples or liquidation value. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon the particular circumstances of a portfolio company or our actual investment position. For example, adjustments to EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring or other related items.\nFS/EIG Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair value. FS/EIG Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider the size and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, and may apply discounts or premiums, where and as appropriate, due to the higher (or lower) financial risk and/or the smaller size of portfolio companies relative to comparable firms, as well as such other factors as our board of trustees, in consultation with FS/EIG Advisor and any approved\nindependent third-party valuation services, if applicable, may consider relevant in assessing fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security.\nWhen we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. Our board of trustees subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value.\nSwap contracts typically will be valued at their daily prices obtained from an independent third party. The aggregate settlement values and notional amounts of the swap contracts will not be recorded in the statements of assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the swap contracts will be recorded in the statements of assets and liabilities as gross assets and gross liabilities and in the statements of operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until closed, when they will be recorded as net realized gain (loss).\nThe fair values of our investments are determined in good faith by our board of trustees. Our board of trustees is solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Our board of trustees has delegated day-to-day responsibility for implementing our valuation policy to FS/EIG Advisor, and has authorized FS/EIG Advisor to utilize independent third-party valuation and pricing services that have been approved by our board of trustees. The valuation committee is responsible for overseeing FS/EIG Advisor's implementation of the valuation process.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into an agreement with FS/EIG Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement are equal to 1.75% of the average weekly value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. Base management fees are generally paid on a quarterly basis in arrears. FS/EIG Advisor agreed to waive incentive fees on income for the period of twelve months ended December 31, 2018. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of this agreement and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and for FS/EIG Advisor's previous election to defer payment of a portion of the base management fee to which it was entitled.\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nPayments Due By Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMaturity Date(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nLess than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1 - 3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n3 - 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMore than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJPMorgan Facility(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFebruary 16, 2023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>416,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>416,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSenior Secured Notes(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAugust 15, 2023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>489,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>489,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nAmounts outstanding under the financing arrangements will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on the maturity date.\n(2)\nAt December 31, 2020, no amounts remained unused under the financing arrangement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the statements in this annual report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements because they relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition.

We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In November 2016, we closed our continuous public offering of common shares to new investors.\nOur investment activities are managed by FS/EIG Advisor and supervised by our board of trustees, a majority of whom are independent. Under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement, we have agreed to pay FS/EIG Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average weekly value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. Our investment activities were managed by FS Advisor until April 9, 2018 and thereafter have been managed by FS/EIG Advisor. FS Advisor previously engaged GSO Capital Partners LP, or GSO, to act as our investment sub-advisor. GSO resigned as our investment sub-advisor and terminated the investment sub-advisory agreement dated April 28, 2011, or the investment sub-advisory agreement, that FS Advisor had entered into with GSO, effective April 9, 2018.\nOur investment policy is to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of our total assets in securities of Energy companies. This investment policy may not be changed without at least 60 days' prior notice to holders of our common shares of any such change.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. We pursue our investment objective by focusing on the following seven investment themes: (i) basin-on-basin competition in U.S. shale, (ii) globalization of natural gas, (iii) coal retirements and the evolving energy generation mix, (iv) renewables focused on power grid parity, (v) export infrastructure for emerging U.S. producers, (vi) market liberalization opening new markets and (vii) midstream infrastructure connecting new supplies. However, we may pursue other investment opportunities if we believe it is in our best interests and consistent with our investment objectives.\nWithin the above investment themes, we intend to focus on the following investment categories in an effort to generate returns for our investors with an acceptable level of risk.\nDirect Originations: Through FS/EIG Advisor, we intend to directly source investment opportunities across the Energy industry. Such investments are typically originated and structured through a negotiated process in which we directly participate and are not generally available to the broader market. These investments may include both debt and equity components. We believe directly originated investments may offer higher returns and more favorable protections than broadly syndicated transactions.\nBroadly Syndicated Loan and Bond Transactions: Although our primary focus is to invest in directly originated transactions, in certain circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield bond markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and provide a complement to our less liquid strategies.\nIn the case of broadly syndicated investments, we generally intend to capitalize on market inefficiencies by investing in loans, bonds, and other asset classes where the market price of such investment reflects a lower\nvalue than we believe is warranted based on our fundamental analysis, providing us with an opportunity to earn an attractive return on our investment.\nOur portfolio is comprised primarily of income-oriented securities, which principally refers to debt securities and income-oriented preferred and common equity interests, of privately-held Energy companies within the United States. We expect to invest primarily in directly originated investments and primary market transactions, as this will provide us with the ability to tailor investments to best match a project's or company's needs with our investment objectives. We intend to weight our portfolio towards senior secured debt and directly originated preferred equity investments, which we believe offer opportunities for superior risk-adjusted returns and income generation. Our debt investments may take the form of corporate or project loans or bonds, may be secured or unsecured and may, in some cases, be accompanied by yield enhancements. These yield enhancements are typically expected to include royalty interests in mineral, oil and gas properties, warrants, options, net profits interests, cash flow participations or other forms of equity participation that can provide additional consideration or upside\u201d in a transaction. Our preferred equity investments are mostly directly originated and may take the form of perpetual or redeemable securities, typically with a current income component and minimum base returns. In addition, certain income-oriented preferred or common equity interests may include interests in master limited partnerships and a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of derivatives, including the use of total return swaps, credit default swaps and other commodity swap contracts. In connection with certain of our debt investments or any restructuring of these debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests, including warrants or options, as additional consideration or otherwise in connection with a restructuring. FS/EIG Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve.\nRevenues\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net realized gain or loss on swap contracts, net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments, net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency investments and net change in unrealized gain or loss on swap contracts. Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Net realized gain or loss on swap contracts is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to the difference between the fixed price specified in the contract and the referenced settlement price. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investments. Net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Net change in unrealized gain or loss on swap contracts is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of the difference between the fixed price specified in the contract and the referenced settlement price.\nWe principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. We also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we may hold. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate FS/EIG Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments.\nFS/EIG Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. FS/EIG Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FS/EIG Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.\nWe reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FS/EIG Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and EIG providing administrative services to us on behalf of FS/EIG Advisor, and for transactional expenses for prospective investments, such as fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of investments that do not close, often referred to as broken deal\u201d costs. We reimburse FS/EIG Advisor no less than quarterly for all costs and expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in performing its obligations and providing personnel under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (1) FS/EIG Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that we estimate would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS/EIG Advisor allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as time allocations and other reasonable metrics. Our board of trustees reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of trustees considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of trustees compares the total amount paid to FS/EIG Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FS/EIG Advisor.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\n\u2022\ncorporate and organization expenses related to offerings of our common shares, subject to limitations included in the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement;\n\u2022\nthe cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party pricing or valuation services;\n\u2022\nthe cost of effecting sales and repurchases of our common shares and other securities;\n\u2022\ninvestment advisory fees;\n\u2022\nfees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n\u2022\ninterest payments on our debt or related obligations;\n\u2022\ntransfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022\nresearch and market data (including news and quotation equipment and services, and any computer hardware and connectivity hardware (e.g. telephone and fiber optic lines) incorporated into the cost of obtaining such research and market data);\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nfederal and state registration fees;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022\nannual fees of the Delaware trustee;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses of our trustees not also serving in an executive officer capacity for us or FS/EIG Advisor;\n\u2022\ncosts of proxy statements, shareholders' reports and notices and other filings;\n\u2022\nour fidelity bond, trustees and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n\u2022\ndirect costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with accounting, corporate governance, government and regulatory affairs activities, independent audits and outside legal costs;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nbrokerage commissions for our investments;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our chief compliance officer; and\n\u2022\nall other expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in performing administrative services for us and administrative personnel paid by FS/EIG Advisor, to the extent they are not controlling persons of FS/EIG Advisor or any of its affiliates, subject to the limitations included in the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement.\nIn addition, we have contracted with State Street to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by FS/EIG Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.\nFor information regarding our fee offset and historical expense reimbursement arrangements with FS Investments and FS/EIG Advisor, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nQualifying Assets\nUnder the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of our total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:\n1.\nSecurities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:\na.\nis organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;\nb.\nis not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and\nc.\nsatisfies any of the following:\ni.\ndoes not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;\nii.\nhas a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;\niii.\nis controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or\niv.\nis a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million.\n2.\nSecurities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.\n3.\nSecurities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.\n4.\nSecurities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.\n5.\nSecurities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.\n6.\nCash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u2009-\u2009Risks Related to Business Development Companies\u2009-\u2009The requirement that we invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets could preclude us from investing in accordance with our current business strategy; conversely, the failure to invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets could result in our failure to maintain our status as a BDC.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2020, 67.6% of our total assets constituted qualifying assets. Therefore, until qualifying assets represent at least 70% of our total assets, we may not make investments other than in qualifying assets. Pending investments in other types of qualifying assets,\u201d we may hold cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.\nCOVID-19 and Energy Market Developments\nRecent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, global lockdowns and ongoing negotiations regarding production levels between oil producing countries, has resulted in lower demand for crude oil and, as a result, lower commodity prices. The impact of these events on the U.S. and global economies (including energy markets), has negatively impacted, and is likely to continue to negatively impact, the business operations of some of our portfolio companies. We cannot at this time fully predict the continued impact of these events on our business or the business of our portfolio companies, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they will negatively impact our portfolio companies' operating results or our own results of operations or financial condition. We expect that certain of our portfolio companies will continue to experience economic distress for the foreseeable future and may become insolvent or otherwise significantly limit business operations if subjected to prolonged economic distress, including as a result of the depressed price of oil or other declines in the energy markets. These developments could result in a further decrease in the value of our investments.\nThese events have already had adverse effects on our investment income and we expect that such adverse effects will continue for some time. These adverse effects have required and may again require us to require us to restructure certain of our investments, which could result in further reductions to our investment income or in impairments on our investments. In addition, disruptions in the capital markets have resulted in illiquidity in certain market areas. These market disruptions and illiquidity have had and are likely to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unfavorable economic conditions caused by these events can also be expected to increase our funding costs and limit our access to the capital markets. These events have limited our investment originations, which is likely to continue for the immediate future, and have also had a material negative impact on our operating results. In addition, depressed mark-to-market valuations of many of our portfolio companies have materially reduced the value of collateral available to secure our financing arrangements. Consequently, this has\nadversely impacted our liquidity, may cause us to fall out of compliance with certain portfolio requirements under the 1940 Act that are tied to the value of our investments and, in each case, may continue to do so in the future.\nIn particular, as a result of these events, we have needed to sell certain investments to satisfy certain margin obligations, and if current market conditions persist or worsen, we may need to sell additional investments at similarly or even more disadvantageous prices, or enter into other transactions on terms that are disadvantageous to us, to satisfy obligations under our financing arrangements.\nIn light of such difficult market conditions and in an effort to preserve our liquidity, we previously determined to suspend for an indefinite period of time our share repurchase program and will reassess our ability to recommence such program in future periods. Moreover, while our board of trustees declared three cash distributions, each in the amount of $0.03 per share, which were paid on July 10, 2020, October 12, 2020 and January 12, 2021, it has not declared or resumed regular cash distributions to shareholders for any period after March 31, 2020, and we expect that future regular cash distributions to shareholders will be suspended until such time that we believe that market conditions and our financial condition support the resumption of such distributions. Our board of trustees has and will continue to evaluate our ability to pay any distributions in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions in the future.\nWe will continue to carefully monitor the impact of both the COVID-19 pandemic and disruptions in the energy markets on our business and the business of our portfolio companies. Because the full effects of these events are not capable of being known at this time, we cannot estimate the impacts on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do, however, expect that these events will continue to have a negative impact on our business and the financial condition of our portfolio companies.\nPortfolio Investment Activity for the Years

Based on our regular monthly cash distribution rate of $0.041667 per share as of December 31, 2019, and the price at which we issued shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan of $5.50 per share, the annualized distribution rate to shareholders as of December 31, 2019 was 9.09%. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total return was (37.68)% and (1.83)%, respectively, and our total return without assuming reinvestment of distributions was (37.02)% and (1.33)%, respectively.\nOur estimated gross portfolio yield and annualized distribution rate to shareholders do not represent actual investment returns to shareholders. Our gross annual portfolio yield and distribution rate to shareholders are subject to change and in the future may be greater or less than the rates set forth above. See Item 1A.

Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.\nThe level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We may experience volatility in the amount of interest income that we earn as the accrual status of existing portfolio investments may fluctuate due to ongoing restructuring activity in the portfolio. The decrease in the amount of interest income and PIK income for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to a combination of factors including an overall decrease in the size of the investment portfolio, certain investments being placed on non-accrual and an increase in the portfolio's allocation to non-income producing assets as a result of restructurings. The increase in the amount of interest income and PIK income for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to a combination of factors including an increase in the size of our directly originated investments and structured preferred equity investments in addition to higher yields in certain of our investments.\nFee income is transaction based, and typically consists of prepayment fees and structuring fees. As such, future fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of\nevents at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees. The decrease in the amount of fee income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the decrease of origination and prepayment activity during the period.\nExpenses\nOur operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by the decline in Energy markets and performance of certain upstream and common equity investments. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by the decline in Energy markets in the fourth quarter and performance of our directly originated investments.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $(874,785) ($(2.00) per share), $(37,123) ($(0.08) per share) and $(60,342) ($(0.14) per share), respectively.\nThis Results of Operations\u201d section should be read in conjunction with COVID-19 and Energy Market Developments\u201d above.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $142,536 in cash, which we held in custodial accounts. As of December 31, 2020, we also had broadly syndicated investments that could be sold to create additional\nliquidity. As of December 31, 2020, we had three senior secured loan investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $19,403 and an unfunded commitment of $2,234 to contribute capital to Sustainable Infrastructure Investments, LLC. We maintain sufficient cash on hand and/or liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nWe generate cash primarily from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan and from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS/EIG Advisor, but unless and until we elect otherwise, as permitted by the 1940 Act, in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See - Financing Arrangements.\u201d\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the net proceeds from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan as well as from sales and paydowns of existing investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nIn light of difficult market conditions, we took several steps during the year to seek to enhance our liquidity by, among other things, suspending our share repurchase program, suspending regular cash distributions and reducing leverage by paying down borrowings. In addition, FS/EIG Advisor deferred the payment of a portion of the management fee to which it was entitled for investment advisory services provided during the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, though FS/EIG Advisor has since received the deferred fees. We believe the net result of such measures resulted in an improved liquidity position for us.\nThis Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section should be read in conjunction with COVID-19 and Energy Market Developments\u201d above and - Financing Arrangements\u201d below.\nFinancing Arrangements\nThe following table presents a summary of information with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\nArrangement(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nType of\nArrangement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nRate(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\nOutstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\nAvailable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMaturity Date\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJPMorgan Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nRevolving/Term\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nL+3.00%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>416,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFebruary 16, 2023\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSenior Secured Notes(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nBond\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n7.50%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>489,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAugust 15, 2023\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>905,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nThe carrying amount outstanding under the facility approximates its fair value, unless otherwise noted.\n(2)\nLIBOR is subject to a 0.00% floor.\n(3)\nAs of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Senior Secured Notes was approximately $473,166.\nFor additional information regarding our financing arrangements, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRIC Tax Treatment and Distributions\nWe have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each tax year, dividends generally of an amount at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income,\u201d which is generally the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined\nwithout regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we may, in certain cases, satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement by distributing dividends relating to a tax year after the close of such tax year under the spillover dividend\u201d provisions of Subchapter M of the Code. If we distribute a spillover dividend, such dividend will be included in a shareholder's gross income for the tax year in which the spillover distribution is paid. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our shareholders to maintain our RIC tax treatment each tax year. We will also be subject to nondeductible U.S. federal excise taxes on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner to our shareholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary taxable income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains over capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to our shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. shareholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared.\nIn general, when we pay regular cash distributions, we intend to declare them on a quarterly or monthly basis and pay them on a monthly basis. We will calculate each shareholder's specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each shareholder's distributions will begin to accrue on the date that common shares are issued to such shareholder. From time to time, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees.\nOur distribution proceeds have exceeded and in the future may exceed our earnings. Therefore, portions of the distributions that we have made represented, and may make in the future may represent, a return of capital to shareholders, which lowers their tax basis in their common shares. A return of capital generally is a return of an investor's investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with our continuous public offering, including any fees payable to FS/EIG Advisor. Moreover, a return of capital will generally not be taxable, but will reduce each shareholder's cost basis in our common shares, and will result in a higher reported capital gain or lower reported capital loss when the common shares on which such return of capital was received are sold. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders.\nWe intend to make any regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution, unless shareholders elect to receive their cash distributions in additional common shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. shareholder.\nWhile our board of trustees declared three cash distributions in 2020, each in the amount of $0.03 per share, which were paid on July 10, 2020, October 12, 2020 and January 12, 2021, they have not declared or resumed regular cash distributions to shareholders for any period after March 31, 2020, and FS/EIG Advisor and our board of trustees expect that future regular cash distributions to shareholders will be suspended until such time that our board of trustees and FS/EIG Advisor believe that market conditions and our financial condition support the resumption of such distributions. Our board of trustees has and will continue to evaluate our ability to pay any distributions in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions in the future.\nThe following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we have declared on our common shares during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nDistribution\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nPer Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.5000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>219,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.5000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>218,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nDistribution\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nPer Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.1733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our distributions, including a reconciliation of our GAAP-basis net investment income to our tax-basis net investment income, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis and deferred taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. We have identified one of our accounting policies, valuation of portfolio investments, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nWe determine the fair value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of trustees. In connection with that determination, FS/EIG Advisor provides our board of trustees with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party valuation services.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n\u2022\nour quarterly fair valuation process begins with FS/EIG Advisor reviewing and documenting preliminary valuations of each portfolio company or investment;\n\u2022\nsuch preliminary valuations for each portfolio company or investment are compared to a valuation range that is obtained from an independent third-party valuation service;\n\u2022\nFS/EIG Advisor then provides the valuation committee of our board of trustees, or the valuation committee, its valuation recommendation for each portfolio company or investment, along with supporting materials;\n\u2022\npreliminary valuations are then discussed with the valuation committee;\n\u2022\nthe valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations and FS/EIG Advisor, together with our independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee;\n\u2022\nfollowing its review, the valuation committee will recommend that our board of trustees approve our fair valuations; and\n\u2022\nour board of trustees discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each such investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of FS/EIG Advisor, the valuation committee and any independent third-party valuation services, if applicable.\nDetermination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, our board of trustees may use any approved independent third-party pricing or valuation services. However, our board of trustees is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information obtained from FS/ EIG Advisor or any approved independent third-party valuation or pricing service that our board of trustees deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that FS/EIG Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may consider when determining the fair value of our investments.\nValuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, we may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the portfolio company in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing our debt investments.\nFor convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used.\nOur equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Our board of trustees, in its determination of fair value, may consider various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value, PV-10 multiples or liquidation value. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon the particular circumstances of a portfolio company or our actual investment position. For example, adjustments to EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring or other related items.\nFS/EIG Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair value. FS/EIG Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider the size and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, and may apply discounts or premiums, where and as appropriate, due to the higher (or lower) financial risk and/or the smaller size of portfolio companies relative to comparable firms, as well as such other factors as our board of trustees, in consultation with FS/EIG Advisor and any approved\nindependent third-party valuation services, if applicable, may consider relevant in assessing fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security.\nWhen we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. Our board of trustees subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value.\nSwap contracts typically will be valued at their daily prices obtained from an independent third party. The aggregate settlement values and notional amounts of the swap contracts will not be recorded in the statements of assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the swap contracts will be recorded in the statements of assets and liabilities as gross assets and gross liabilities and in the statements of operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until closed, when they will be recorded as net realized gain (loss).\nThe fair values of our investments are determined in good faith by our board of trustees. Our board of trustees is solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Our board of trustees has delegated day-to-day responsibility for implementing our valuation policy to FS/EIG Advisor, and has authorized FS/EIG Advisor to utilize independent third-party valuation and pricing services that have been approved by our board of trustees. The valuation committee is responsible for overseeing FS/EIG Advisor's implementation of the valuation process.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into an agreement with FS/EIG Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement are equal to 1.75% of the average weekly value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. Base management fees are generally paid on a quarterly basis in arrears. FS/EIG Advisor agreed to waive incentive fees on income for the period of twelve months ended December 31, 2018. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of this agreement and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and for FS/EIG Advisor's previous election to defer payment of a portion of the base management fee to which it was entitled.\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nPayments Due By Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMaturity Date(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nLess than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n1 - 3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n3 - 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMore than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJPMorgan Facility(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFebruary 16, 2023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>416,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>416,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSenior Secured Notes(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nAugust 15, 2023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>489,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>489,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nAmounts outstanding under the financing arrangements will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on the maturity date.\n(2)\nAt December 31, 2020, no amounts remained unused under the financing arrangement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the statements in this annual report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements because they relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition.

We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In November 2016, we closed our continuous public offering of common shares to new investors.\nOur investment activities are managed by FS/EIG Advisor and supervised by our board of trustees, a majority of whom are independent. Under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement, we have agreed to pay FS/EIG Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average weekly value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. Our investment activities were managed by FS Advisor until April 9, 2018 and thereafter have been managed by FS/EIG Advisor. FS Advisor previously engaged GSO Capital Partners LP, or GSO, to act as our investment sub-advisor. GSO resigned as our investment sub-advisor and terminated the investment sub-advisory agreement dated April 28, 2011, or the investment sub-advisory agreement, that FS Advisor had entered into with GSO, effective April 9, 2018.\nOur investment policy is to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of our total assets in securities of Energy companies. This investment policy may not be changed without at least 60 days' prior notice to holders of our common shares of any such change.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. We pursue our investment objective by focusing on the following seven investment themes: (i) basin-on-basin competition in U.S. shale, (ii) globalization of natural gas, (iii) coal retirements and the evolving energy generation mix, (iv) renewables focused on power grid parity, (v) export infrastructure for emerging U.S. producers, (vi) market liberalization opening new markets and (vii) midstream infrastructure connecting new supplies. However, we may pursue other investment opportunities if we believe it is in our best interests and consistent with our investment objectives.\nWithin the above investment themes, we intend to focus on the following investment categories in an effort to generate returns for our investors with an acceptable level of risk.\nDirect Originations: Through FS/EIG Advisor, we intend to directly source investment opportunities across the Energy industry. Such investments are typically originated and structured through a negotiated process in which we directly participate and are not generally available to the broader market. These investments may include both debt and equity components. We believe directly originated investments may offer higher returns and more favorable protections than broadly syndicated transactions.\nBroadly Syndicated Loan and Bond Transactions: Although our primary focus is to invest in directly originated transactions, in certain circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield bond markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and provide a complement to our less liquid strategies.\nIn the case of broadly syndicated investments, we generally intend to capitalize on market inefficiencies by investing in loans, bonds, and other asset classes where the market price of such investment reflects a lower\nvalue than we believe is warranted based on our fundamental analysis, providing us with an opportunity to earn an attractive return on our investment.\nOur portfolio is comprised primarily of income-oriented securities, which principally refers to debt securities and income-oriented preferred and common equity interests, of privately-held Energy companies within the United States. We expect to invest primarily in directly originated investments and primary market transactions, as this will provide us with the ability to tailor investments to best match a project's or company's needs with our investment objectives. We intend to weight our portfolio towards senior secured debt and directly originated preferred equity investments, which we believe offer opportunities for superior risk-adjusted returns and income generation. Our debt investments may take the form of corporate or project loans or bonds, may be secured or unsecured and may, in some cases, be accompanied by yield enhancements. These yield enhancements are typically expected to include royalty interests in mineral, oil and gas properties, warrants, options, net profits interests, cash flow participations or other forms of equity participation that can provide additional consideration or upside\u201d in a transaction. Our preferred equity investments are mostly directly originated and may take the form of perpetual or redeemable securities, typically with a current income component and minimum base returns. In addition, certain income-oriented preferred or common equity interests may include interests in master limited partnerships and a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of derivatives, including the use of total return swaps, credit default swaps and other commodity swap contracts. In connection with certain of our debt investments or any restructuring of these debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests, including warrants or options, as additional consideration or otherwise in connection with a restructuring. FS/EIG Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve.\nRevenues\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net realized gain or loss on swap contracts, net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments, net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency investments and net change in unrealized gain or loss on swap contracts. Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Net realized gain or loss on swap contracts is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to the difference between the fixed price specified in the contract and the referenced settlement price. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investments. Net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Net change in unrealized gain or loss on swap contracts is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of the difference between the fixed price specified in the contract and the referenced settlement price.\nWe principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. We also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we may hold. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate FS/EIG Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments.\nFS/EIG Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. FS/EIG Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FS/EIG Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.\nWe reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FS/EIG Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and EIG providing administrative services to us on behalf of FS/EIG Advisor, and for transactional expenses for prospective investments, such as fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of investments that do not close, often referred to as broken deal\u201d costs. We reimburse FS/EIG Advisor no less than quarterly for all costs and expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in performing its obligations and providing personnel under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (1) FS/EIG Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that we estimate would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS/EIG Advisor allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as time allocations and other reasonable metrics. Our board of trustees reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of trustees considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of trustees compares the total amount paid to FS/EIG Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FS/EIG Advisor.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\n\u2022\ncorporate and organization expenses related to offerings of our common shares, subject to limitations included in the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement;\n\u2022\nthe cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party pricing or valuation services;\n\u2022\nthe cost of effecting sales and repurchases of our common shares and other securities;\n\u2022\ninvestment advisory fees;\n\u2022\nfees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n\u2022\ninterest payments on our debt or related obligations;\n\u2022\ntransfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022\nresearch and market data (including news and quotation equipment and services, and any computer hardware and connectivity hardware (e.g. telephone and fiber optic lines) incorporated into the cost of obtaining such research and market data);\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nfederal and state registration fees;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022\nannual fees of the Delaware trustee;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses of our trustees not also serving in an executive officer capacity for us or FS/EIG Advisor;\n\u2022\ncosts of proxy statements, shareholders' reports and notices and other filings;\n\u2022\nour fidelity bond, trustees and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n\u2022\ndirect costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with accounting, corporate governance, government and regulatory affairs activities, independent audits and outside legal costs;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nbrokerage commissions for our investments;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our chief compliance officer; and\n\u2022\nall other expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in performing administrative services for us and administrative personnel paid by FS/EIG Advisor, to the extent they are not controlling persons of FS/EIG Advisor or any of its affiliates, subject to the limitations included in the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement.\nIn addition, we have contracted with State Street to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by FS/EIG Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.\nFor information regarding our fee offset and historical expense reimbursement arrangements with FS Investments and FS/EIG Advisor, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nQualifying Assets\nUnder the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of our total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:\n1.\nSecurities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:\na.\nis organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;\nb.\nis not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and\nc.\nsatisfies any of the following:\ni.\ndoes not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;\nii.\nhas a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;\niii.\nis controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or\niv.\nis a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million.\n2.\nSecurities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.\n3.\nSecurities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.\n4.\nSecurities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.\n5.\nSecurities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.\n6.\nCash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u2009-\u2009Risks Related to Business Development Companies\u2009-\u2009The requirement that we invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets could preclude us from investing in accordance with our current business strategy; conversely, the failure to invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets could result in our failure to maintain our status as a BDC.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2020, 67.6% of our total assets constituted qualifying assets. Therefore, until qualifying assets represent at least 70% of our total assets, we may not make investments other than in qualifying assets. Pending investments in other types of qualifying assets,\u201d we may hold cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.\nCOVID-19 and Energy Market Developments\nRecent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, global lockdowns and ongoing negotiations regarding production levels between oil producing countries, has resulted in lower demand for crude oil and, as a result, lower commodity prices. The impact of these events on the U.S. and global economies (including energy markets), has negatively impacted, and is likely to continue to negatively impact, the business operations of some of our portfolio companies. We cannot at this time fully predict the continued impact of these events on our business or the business of our portfolio companies, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they will negatively impact our portfolio companies' operating results or our own results of operations or financial condition. We expect that certain of our portfolio companies will continue to experience economic distress for the foreseeable future and may become insolvent or otherwise significantly limit business operations if subjected to prolonged economic distress, including as a result of the depressed price of oil or other declines in the energy markets. These developments could result in a further decrease in the value of our investments.\nThese events have already had adverse effects on our investment income and we expect that such adverse effects will continue for some time. These adverse effects have required and may again require us to require us to restructure certain of our investments, which could result in further reductions to our investment income or in impairments on our investments. In addition, disruptions in the capital markets have resulted in illiquidity in certain market areas. These market disruptions and illiquidity have had and are likely to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unfavorable economic conditions caused by these events can also be expected to increase our funding costs and limit our access to the capital markets. These events have limited our investment originations, which is likely to continue for the immediate future, and have also had a material negative impact on our operating results. In addition, depressed mark-to-market valuations of many of our portfolio companies have materially reduced the value of collateral available to secure our financing arrangements. Consequently, this has\nadversely impacted our liquidity, may cause us to fall out of compliance with certain portfolio requirements under the 1940 Act that are tied to the value of our investments and, in each case, may continue to do so in the future.\nIn particular, as a result of these events, we have needed to sell certain investments to satisfy certain margin obligations, and if current market conditions persist or worsen, we may need to sell additional investments at similarly or even more disadvantageous prices, or enter into other transactions on terms that are disadvantageous to us, to satisfy obligations under our financing arrangements.\nIn light of such difficult market conditions and in an effort to preserve our liquidity, we previously determined to suspend for an indefinite period of time our share repurchase program and will reassess our ability to recommence such program in future periods. Moreover, while our board of trustees declared three cash distributions, each in the amount of $0.03 per share, which were paid on July 10, 2020, October 12, 2020 and January 12, 2021, it has not declared or resumed regular cash distributions to shareholders for any period after March 31, 2020, and we expect that future regular cash distributions to shareholders will be suspended until such time that we believe that market conditions and our financial condition support the resumption of such distributions. Our board of trustees has and will continue to evaluate our ability to pay any distributions in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions in the future.\nWe will continue to carefully monitor the impact of both the COVID-19 pandemic and disruptions in the energy markets on our business and the business of our portfolio companies. Because the full effects of these events are not capable of being known at this time, we cannot estimate the impacts on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do, however, expect that these events will continue to have a negative impact on our business and the financial condition of our portfolio companies.\nPortfolio Investment Activity for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nTotal Portfolio Activity\nThe following tables present certain selected information regarding our portfolio investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n(1)\nAmortized cost represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and/or accretion of discounts, as applicable, on investments.\nThe following table presents certain selected information regarding the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nWhile our board of trustees declared three cash distributions, each in the amount of $0.03 per share, which were paid on July 10, 2020, October 12, 2020 and January 12, 2021, it has not declared or resumed regular cash distributions in 2020 to shareholders for any period after March 31, 2020, and FS/EIG Advisor and our board of trustees expect that future regular cash distributions to shareholders will be suspended until such time that our board of trustees and FS/EIG Advisor believe that market conditions and our financial condition support the resumption of such distributions. Our board of trustees has and will continue to evaluate our ability to pay any distributions in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions in the future and any annualized distribution rate provided in this report may not be representative of the actual distribution rate for any period. Based on the distributions declared during 2020 of $0.1733 per share, and the price at which we issued shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan of $3.30 per share as of December 31, 2020, the annualized distribution rate to shareholders as of December 31, 2020 was 5.25%. Based on our regular monthly cash distribution rate of $0.041667 per share as of December 31, 2019, and the price at which we issued shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan of $5.50 per share, the annualized distribution rate to shareholders as of December 31, 2019 was 9.09%. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total return was (37.68)% and (1.83)%, respectively, and our total return without assuming reinvestment of distributions was (37.02)% and (1.33)%, respectively.\nOur estimated gross portfolio yield and annualized distribution rate to shareholders do not represent actual investment returns to shareholders. Our gross annual portfolio yield and distribution rate to shareholders are subject to change and in the future may be greater or less than the rates set forth above. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nDirect Originations\nThe following tables present certain selected information regarding our direct originations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020:\n\n\n\nThe following table presents certain selected information regarding our direct originations as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nPortfolio Composition by Strategy\nThe table below summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio by strategy and enumerates the percentage, by fair value, of the total portfolio assets in such strategies as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investment portfolio.\nPortfolio Asset Quality\nIn addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, FS/EIG Advisor uses, and FS Advisor historically used, an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. FS/EIG Advisor uses, and FS Advisor historically used, an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:\n\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nThe amount of the portfolio in each grading category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of the portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the grade of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nRevenues\nOur investment income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:\n\n(1)\nSuch revenues represent $161,239, $301,214 and $309,907 of cash income earned as well as $60,687, $64,696 and $24,071 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.\nThe level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We may experience volatility in the amount of interest income that we earn as the accrual status of existing portfolio investments may fluctuate due to ongoing restructuring activity in the portfolio. The decrease in the amount of interest income and PIK income for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to a combination of factors including an overall decrease in the size of the investment portfolio, certain investments being placed on non-accrual and an increase in the portfolio's allocation to non-income producing assets as a result of restructurings. The increase in the amount of interest income and PIK income for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to a combination of factors including an increase in the size of our directly originated investments and structured preferred equity investments in addition to higher yields in certain of our investments.\nFee income is transaction based, and typically consists of prepayment fees and structuring fees. As such, future fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of\nevents at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees. The decrease in the amount of fee income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the decrease of origination and prepayment activity during the period.\nExpenses\nOur operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n\nThe following table reflects selected expense ratios as a percent of average net assets for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\nInterest expense may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on changes in benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR, utilization rates and the terms of our financing arrangements, among other factors.\nManagement Fee Offset\nStructuring or other upfront fees received by FS/EIG Advisor which were offset against management fees due to FS/EIG Advisor from us were $706, $5,992 and $1,276 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the management fee offset for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNet Investment Income\nOur net investment income totaled $82,447 ($0.19 per share), $201,784 ($0.46 per share) and $185,223 ($0.42 per share) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\nOur net realized gains (losses) on investments, swap contracts and debt extinguishment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n\n(1)\nWe sold investments and received principal repayments of $992,178 and $83,350, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020, $882,557 and $430,515, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2019 and $1,401,163 and $547,251, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Swap Contracts and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency\nOur net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments, swap contracts and foreign currency for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by the conversion of unrealized depreciation to realized losses and the performance of certain of our upstream and equity/other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by the decline in Energy markets and performance of certain upstream and common equity investments. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by the decline in Energy markets in the fourth quarter and performance of our directly originated investments.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $(874,785) ($(2.00) per share), $(37,123) ($(0.08) per share) and $(60,342) ($(0.14) per share), respectively.\nThis Results of Operations\u201d section should be read in conjunction with COVID-19 and Energy Market Developments\u201d above.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $142,536 in cash, which we held in custodial accounts. As of December 31, 2020, we also had broadly syndicated investments that could be sold to create additional\nliquidity. As of December 31, 2020, we had three senior secured loan investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $19,403 and an unfunded commitment of $2,234 to contribute capital to Sustainable Infrastructure Investments, LLC. We maintain sufficient cash on hand and/or liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nWe generate cash primarily from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan and from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS/EIG Advisor, but unless and until we elect otherwise, as permitted by the 1940 Act, in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See - Financing Arrangements.\u201d\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the net proceeds from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan as well as from sales and paydowns of existing investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nIn light of difficult market conditions, we took several steps during the year to seek to enhance our liquidity by, among other things, suspending our share repurchase program, suspending regular cash distributions and reducing leverage by paying down borrowings. In addition, FS/EIG Advisor deferred the payment of a portion of the management fee to which it was entitled for investment advisory services provided during the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, though FS/EIG Advisor has since received the deferred fees. We believe the net result of such measures resulted in an improved liquidity position for us.\nThis Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section should be read in conjunction with COVID-19 and Energy Market Developments\u201d above and - Financing Arrangements\u201d below.\nFinancing Arrangements\nThe following table presents a summary of information with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2020:\n\n(1)\nThe carrying amount outstanding under the facility approximates its fair value, unless otherwise noted.\n(2)\nLIBOR is subject to a 0.00% floor.\n(3)\nAs of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Senior Secured Notes was approximately $473,166.\nFor additional information regarding our financing arrangements, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRIC Tax Treatment and Distributions\nWe have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each tax year, dividends generally of an amount at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income,\u201d which is generally the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined\nwithout regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we may, in certain cases, satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement by distributing dividends relating to a tax year after the close of such tax year under the spillover dividend\u201d provisions of Subchapter M of the Code. If we distribute a spillover dividend, such dividend will be included in a shareholder's gross income for the tax year in which the spillover distribution is paid. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our shareholders to maintain our RIC tax treatment each tax year. We will also be subject to nondeductible U.S. federal excise taxes on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner to our shareholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary taxable income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains over capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to our shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. shareholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared.\nIn general, when we pay regular cash distributions, we intend to declare them on a quarterly or monthly basis and pay them on a monthly basis. We will calculate each shareholder's specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each shareholder's distributions will begin to accrue on the date that common shares are issued to such shareholder. From time to time, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees.\nOur distribution proceeds have exceeded and in the future may exceed our earnings. Therefore, portions of the distributions that we have made represented, and may make in the future may represent, a return of capital to shareholders, which lowers their tax basis in their common shares. A return of capital generally is a return of an investor's investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with our continuous public offering, including any fees payable to FS/EIG Advisor. Moreover, a return of capital will generally not be taxable, but will reduce each shareholder's cost basis in our common shares, and will result in a higher reported capital gain or lower reported capital loss when the common shares on which such return of capital was received are sold. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders.\nWe intend to make any regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution, unless shareholders elect to receive their cash distributions in additional common shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. shareholder.\nWhile our board of trustees declared three cash distributions in 2020, each in the amount of $0.03 per share, which were paid on July 10, 2020, October 12, 2020 and January 12, 2021, they have not declared or resumed regular cash distributions to shareholders for any period after March 31, 2020, and FS/EIG Advisor and our board of trustees expect that future regular cash distributions to shareholders will be suspended until such time that our board of trustees and FS/EIG Advisor believe that market conditions and our financial condition support the resumption of such distributions. Our board of trustees has and will continue to evaluate our ability to pay any distributions in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions in the future.\nThe following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we have declared on our common shares during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\n\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our distributions, including a reconciliation of our GAAP-basis net investment income to our tax-basis net investment income, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis and deferred taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. We have identified one of our accounting policies, valuation of portfolio investments, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nWe determine the fair value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of trustees. In connection with that determination, FS/EIG Advisor provides our board of trustees with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party valuation services.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n\u2022\nour quarterly fair valuation process begins with FS/EIG Advisor reviewing and documenting preliminary valuations of each portfolio company or investment;\n\u2022\nsuch preliminary valuations for each portfolio company or investment are compared to a valuation range that is obtained from an independent third-party valuation service;\n\u2022\nFS/EIG Advisor then provides the valuation committee of our board of trustees, or the valuation committee, its valuation recommendation for each portfolio company or investment, along with supporting materials;\n\u2022\npreliminary valuations are then discussed with the valuation committee;\n\u2022\nthe valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations and FS/EIG Advisor, together with our independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee;\n\u2022\nfollowing its review, the valuation committee will recommend that our board of trustees approve our fair valuations; and\n\u2022\nour board of trustees discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each such investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of FS/EIG Advisor, the valuation committee and any independent third-party valuation services, if applicable.\nDetermination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, our board of trustees may use any approved independent third-party pricing or valuation services. However, our board of trustees is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information obtained from FS/ EIG Advisor or any approved independent third-party valuation or pricing service that our board of trustees deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that FS/EIG Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may consider when determining the fair value of our investments.\nValuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, we may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the portfolio company in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing our debt investments.\nFor convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used.\nOur equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Our board of trustees, in its determination of fair value, may consider various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value, PV-10 multiples or liquidation value. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon the particular circumstances of a portfolio company or our actual investment position. For example, adjustments to EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring or other related items.\nFS/EIG Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair value. FS/EIG Advisor, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider the size and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, and may apply discounts or premiums, where and as appropriate, due to the higher (or lower) financial risk and/or the smaller size of portfolio companies relative to comparable firms, as well as such other factors as our board of trustees, in consultation with FS/EIG Advisor and any approved\nindependent third-party valuation services, if applicable, may consider relevant in assessing fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security.\nWhen we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. Our board of trustees subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value.\nSwap contracts typically will be valued at their daily prices obtained from an independent third party. The aggregate settlement values and notional amounts of the swap contracts will not be recorded in the statements of assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the swap contracts will be recorded in the statements of assets and liabilities as gross assets and gross liabilities and in the statements of operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until closed, when they will be recorded as net realized gain (loss).\nThe fair values of our investments are determined in good faith by our board of trustees. Our board of trustees is solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Our board of trustees has delegated day-to-day responsibility for implementing our valuation policy to FS/EIG Advisor, and has authorized FS/EIG Advisor to utilize independent third-party valuation and pricing services that have been approved by our board of trustees. The valuation committee is responsible for overseeing FS/EIG Advisor's implementation of the valuation process.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into an agreement with FS/EIG Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement are equal to 1.75% of the average weekly value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. Base management fees are generally paid on a quarterly basis in arrears. FS/EIG Advisor agreed to waive incentive fees on income for the period of twelve months ended December 31, 2018. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of this agreement and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and for FS/EIG Advisor's previous election to defer payment of a portion of the base management fee to which it was entitled.\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2020 is as follows:\n\n(1)\nAmounts outstanding under the financing arrangements will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on the maturity date.\n(2)\nAt December 31, 2020, no amounts remained unused under the financing arrangement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices.", "item_7_tables":

financial condition and results of operations provides insight into a company's financial activities, performance, and future outlook. It is a detailed and comprehensive report which shareholders and investors should read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes to understand the company's financial position fully.\n\nThe MD&A typically includes:\n\n1. **Forward-Looking Statements:** This section covers statements about the company's expectations for the future, which include operating results, business prospects, impacts of investments, company objectives, financing arrangements, changes in the interest rate environment, cash resources, cash flows, contractual arrangements, potential conflicts of interest, economic and industry trends, regulatory impacts, tax positions, and qualifications as a Regulated Investment Company (RIC) and Business Development Company (BDC). It also highlights factors that could cause actual results to differ, such as changes in the economy, disruptions from terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, and changes in laws or regulations.\n\n2. **Overview:** Discusses the company's formation, management, investment objectives, strategies, and activities. It provides information on the management team, board of trustees, investment advisory agreements, investment policy, and objective to generate current income and capital appreciation. The types of investments made, such as direct originations, broadly syndicated loans, and bond transactions, are detailed, along with the portfolio composition, which primarily includes income-oriented securities.\n\n3. **Revenues:** Outlines the key sources of revenues, such as interest income, dividends, fees, commitment, origination, structuring, managerial assistance, and performance-based fees.\n\n4. **Expenses:** Highlights the main operating expenses, including management and incentive fees, administrative costs, interest on debt, and other transaction-related expenses. It explains how the FS/EIG Advisor oversees operations, allocates costs, and gets reimbursed.\n\n5. **Qualifying Assets:** Refers to the types of assets a BDC under the 1940 Act can acquire and the requirement that 70% of the total assets must be \"qualifying assets.\"\n\n6. **COVID-19 and Energy Market Developments:** Discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and oil market fluctuations on the company and its portfolio companies, such as adverse effects on investment income, need for investment restructuring, market disruptions, liquidity issues, suspension of share repurchase program, and regular cash distributions.\n\n7. **Portfolio Investment Activity:** This includes detailed tables of investment activities, new investment activity by asset class, a summary of the investment portfolio composition at cost and fair value, the composition of the portfolio, direct origination activities, characteristics of all direct originations in the portfolio, and the portfolio composition by strategy.\n\n8. **Portfolio Asset Quality:** Describes the internal investment rating system used to monitor and assess the quality and performance of investments.\n\n9. **Results of Operations:** Compares revenue, net investment income, realized gains or losses, and changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments across different years.\n\n10. **Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources:** Gives an overview of the company's cash position, sources of cash, use of leverage, tax treatment as a RIC, distributions made, critical accounting policies, valuation of investments, contractual obligations, and financing arrangements.\n\n11. **Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:** Specifies if the company has any off-balance sheet arrangements or engages in risk management or hedging practices (the company currently does not).\n\nThis summary provides an executive overview of the MD&A section, which is considerably more detailed and includes specific financial figures and disclosures. The MD&A should be read in its entirety to fully grasp the company's financial situation and management's perspective on past performance and future expectations."}
