Demand for proppants through the first half of 2016 decreased due to the downturn in commodity prices originating in late 2014 and the corresponding reduction in oil and natural gas drilling, completion and production activity. The change in demand during this period impacted contract discussions and negotiated terms with our customers as existing contracts were adjusted, resulting in a combination of reduced average selling prices per ton, and adjustments to take-or-pay volumes and lengths of contracts. During the market downturn, customers began to purchase more volumes on a spot basis as compared to committing to long-term contracts, and this trend continued until oil and natural gas drilling and completion activity began to increase beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. From early 2017 through the second quarter of 2018, improvements in oil and natural gas prices created a more stable market environment. During the second half of 2018, the demand for Northern White sand decreased, which we believe was due primarily to insufficient takeaway capacity for the incremental oil and natural gas production coming online in the Permian Basin, along with increased availability of regional sand as a source of proppant in the Permian basin. Additionally, oil and natural gas companies reduced their spending in the latter portion of the year due to strong spending in the first half of 2018 and lower oil prices, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our spot sales continued at decreased rates through the second half of 2018, and we have agreed to temporary price adjustments under certain of our long-term agreements. In general, we have received a term extension in exchange for such price adjustments. Otherwise, the contractual terms under our long-term agreements have not changed materially. In general, customers under long-term take or pay contracts are required to make periodic shortfall payments, which we recognize as revenue in our results of operations in the period in which the obligation becomes due. Contracted volumes have decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting in additional shortfall revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nWe are a fully integrated frac sand supply and services company, offering complete mine to wellsite solutions for our customers. We produce low-cost, high quality Northern White raw frac sand, which is a premium proppant used to enhance hydrocarbon recovery rates in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. We also offer proppant logistics solutions to our customers through our in-basin transloading terminal and wellsite storage capabilities. We currently market our products and services primarily to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and oilfield service companies and sell our\nproducts under a combination of long-term take-or-pay contracts and spot sales in the open market. We believe that the size and favorable geologic characteristics of our sand reserves, the strategic location and logistical advantages of our facilities, our proprietary portable wellsite storage solutions and the industry experience of our senior management team have positioned us as a highly attractive provider of raw frac sand and proppant logistics services from the mine to the wellsite.\nWe own and operate a raw frac sand mine and related processing facility near Oakdale, Wisconsin, at which we have approximately 317 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves as of December 31, 2018. We incorporated in Delaware in July 2011 and began operations with 1.1 million tons of annual nameplate processing capacity in July 2012. After several expansions, our current annual nameplate processing capacity at our Oakdale facility is approximately 5.5 million tons of raw frac sand per year. Our integrated Oakdale facility, with onsite rail infrastructure and wet and dry sand processing facilities, has access to two Class I rail lines, which enables us to process and cost effectively deliver products to our customers.\nRecent Developments\nWellsite Storage Solutions\nOn June 1, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Quickthree Solutions, Inc. ( Quickthree\u201d), a manufacturer of portable vertical proppant storage solution systems. The consideration for the transaction consisted of approximately $30.0 million in cash, which was paid at closing using cash on hand and advances under the Credit Facility, and up to $12.8 million in potential earn-out payments, which are to be paid as system components are built and made available for sale or lease over the three-year period from the acquisition date. We believe that this acquisition provides us the technology, production capacity and management team to compete further in the proppant logistics market and will provide us with an opportunity to expand our customer base by being able to offer proppant logistics services all the way to the wellsite.\nVan Hook Transload Terminal\nOn March 15, 2018, we acquired the rights to operate a multi-unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota to service the Bakken Formation, in the Williston Basin. We paid consideration of approximately $15.5 million to acquire certain assets at the Van Hook terminal, and entered into a long-term lease agreement in connection with the transaction. As part of this transaction, we entered into a long-term agreement with Canadian Pacific Railway to service the Van Hook terminal directly along with the other key oil and natural gas exploration and production basins of North America. The Van Hook terminal became operational in April 2018. Since operations have commenced, we have been providing Northern White sand in-basin at this terminal to our customers. We believe this new terminal provides us with an opportunity to expand our customer base and offer more efficient delivery options to customers operating in the Williston Basin.\nAssets and Operations\nOakdale\nOur sand reserves include a balanced concentration of coarse sand, (19% 20/40 and coarser), finer sand (41% of 40/70 mesh) and fine sand (40% 60/140 gradation, which we refer to in this annual report as 100 mesh\u201d). Our 30/50 gradation is a derivative of the 20/40 and 40/70 blends. We believe that this mix of coarse and fine sand reserves, combined with contractual demand for our products across a range of mesh sizes, provides us with relatively higher mining yields and lower processing costs than frac sand mines with predominantly coarse sand reserves. In addition, our approximate 317 million tons of proven recoverable reserves implies a reserve life of approximately 58 years based on our current annual nameplate processing capacity of 5.5 million tons. This long reserve life enables us to better serve demand for different types of raw frac sand as compared to mines with shorter reserve lives.\nOur Oakdale facility is purpose-built to exploit the reserve profile in place and produce high-quality raw frac sand. Unlike some of our competitors, our primary processing and rail loading facilities are located in close proximity to the mine site, which limits the need for us to truck sand on public roads between the mine and the production facility or between wet and dry processing facilities. Our on-site transportation assets include approximately nine miles of rail track in a triple-loop configuration and four railcar loading facilities that are connected to a Class I rail line owned by Canadian Pacific. This enables us to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains and significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers' raw frac sand transportation needs. With the addition of our unit train capable transload facility approximately three miles from the Oakdale facility in Byron Township, Wisconsin, we also have the ability to ship sand to our customers on the Union Pacific network. We believe that we are the only sand facility in Wisconsin that has dual served rail capabilities, which should create competition among our rail carriers and allow us to provide more competitive logistics options for our customers.\nDue to sustained freezing temperatures in our area of operation during winter months, we have historically halted the operation of our wet plant for approximately three to five months. As a result, we have excavated and washed sand in excess of\ncurrent delivery requirements during the months when the wet plant was operational. This excess sand is placed in stockpiles that feed the dry plants and enable us to fill customer orders throughout the year without interruption. Our second wet plant facility, brought online in the fourth quarter of 2017, is enclosed, which allows us to operate at full capacity during the winter months.\nLogistics\nThrough our acquisitions of the transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota and a manufacturer of portable vertical frac sand storage systems, we have expanded our logistics capabilities. We now provide Northern White sand in-basin to customers operating in the Williston Basin and we have the technology, production capacity and management team to compete further in the raw frac sand supply chain for our customers by offering logistics services all the way to the wellsite.\nWe intend to continue expanding our footprint in-basin through the addition of one or more terminals in other oil and natural gas operating basins while expanding our wellsite storage solutions fleets. Benefits of our long-term growth strategy for in-basin delivery of sand include new contracted customers by marketing through our own terminal, more opportunity for spot sales by forward deploying sand and the opportunity to capture incremental margin on the sale of sand farther down the supply chain by managing the cost of rail and terminal operations. Additionally, having a presence in-basin gives us an opportunity to have a base of operations from which to market our wellsite solutions. We believe our key differentiators in our wellsite storage solutions are:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>i.\n</td> <td>our portable silos can be set up or taken down rapidly;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ii.\n</td> <td>our trailers detach, which reduces their footprint;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>iii.\n</td> <td>our storage silos include industry-leading passive and active dust suppression technology; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>iv.\n</td> <td>our patented system is the only one of its kind that has the capability of a gravity-fed operation and when used in combination with our Quickload system, our silos can be filled by both pneumatic and gravity dump trailers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Through the expansion of our wellsite storage solutions fleet and the addition of one or more terminals, we continue evaluating ways to reduce the landed cost of our products in-basin and to the wellsite for our customers while increasing our customized service offerings to provide our customers with additional delivery and pricing alternatives, including selling product on an as-delivered\u201d basis to the wellsite.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nWe generate revenue by excavating and processing frac sand, which we sell to our customers under long-term price agreements or as spot sales at prevailing market rates. In some instances, revenues also include a charge for transportation services provided to customers. Our transportation revenue fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the volume of product transported and the distance between the plant and our customers.\nWe have entered into long-term take-or-pay contracts with customers that are intended to mitigate our exposure to the potential price volatility of the spot market for raw frac sand and to enhance the stability of our cash flows. Our contracts contain a minimum volume purchase requirement and provides for delivery of raw frac sand FCA at our Oakdale facility, our Van Hook transloading terminal in the Bakken, or another location specified by our customers. As of March 1, 2019, we have approximately 58.7% of our current annual nameplate production capacity contracted under eight long-term take-or-pay contracts with a weighted average life of approximately two years.\nRevenue is generally recognized FCA, payment made at the origination point at our facility, and title passes as the product is loaded into railcars hired by the customer or provided by us. Certain contracted and spot-rate customers have shipping terms of FCA, DAT or DAP, payment made at the destination, for which we recognize revenue when the sand is delivered.\nCosts of Conducting Our Business\nThe principal direct costs involved in operating our business are labor, maintenance, utility costs, equipment and excavation. We incur labor costs associated with employees at our processing facility represent the most significant cost of converting raw frac sand to finished product. Our Oakdale facility undergoes maintenance to minimize unscheduled downtime and ensure the ongoing quality of our raw frac sand. We incur utility costs in connection with the operation of our processing facility, primarily electricity and natural gas, which are both susceptible to market fluctuations. We lease equipment in many areas of our operations including our plants, mining equipment and logistics services. Excavation costs with respect to the excavation of sand and other materials from which we ultimately do not derive revenue. However, the ratio of rejected\nmaterials to total amounts excavated has been, and we believe will continue to be, in line with our expectations, given the extensive core sampling and other testing we undertook at the Oakdale facility. In addition, other costs include processing costs, overhead allocation, depreciation and depletion are capitalized as a component of inventory and are reflected in cost of goods sold when inventory is sold.\nOverall Trends and Outlook\nDemand Trends\nAccording to Spears, the North American proppant market, including raw frac sand, ceramic and resin-coated proppant, was approximately 98 million tons in 2018, which is a 33% increase over the 74 million tons Spears reported for 2017. Spears estimates that 2019 demand will increase 4% and 2020 demand will increase another 14%, representing an increase of approximately 25 million tons in proppant demand over the next two years.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019E\n</td> <td>2020E\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New US Horizontal Wells\n</td> <td>20,819\n</td> <td>14,413\n</td> <td>8,599\n</td> <td>13,116\n</td> <td>15,691\n</td> <td>14,840\n</td> <td>15,233\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proppant Demand (Mil Tons)\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>120\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDemand growth for raw frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by advancements in oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. These advancements have made the extraction of oil and natural gas increasingly cost-effective in formations that historically would have been uneconomic to develop. More proppant is being used per well, which is driving the increase in proppant demand despite horizontal drilling activity stabilizing. Spears estimates that proppant demand will reach approximately 101 million tons in 2019 and 120 million tons in 2020. Spears also estimates that average proppant usage per well was approximately 5,800 tons per well in 2018 and will rise to approximately 7,400 tons per well by the end of 2020.\nSupply Trends\nIn 2018, significant capacity was added in numerous regions. The total mine capacity outpaced customer demand for raw frac sand leading to an over supplied market which has put pricing pressure on high-quality raw frac sand. Several factors contributing to this supply surplus include over-development of new sand mines in response to the prior year shortage, an increase in the usage of local sand, and logistical challenges on delivering sand in the higher quantities required by the new higher proppant intensity wells.\nSupplies of high-quality Northern White raw frac sand are limited to select areas, predominantly in western Wisconsin and limited areas of Minnesota and Illinois. The ability to obtain large contiguous reserves in these areas is a key constraint and can be an important supply consideration when assessing the economic viability of a potential raw frac sand facility. Further constraining the supply and throughput of Northern White raw frac sand is that not all of the large reserve mines have onsite excavation and processing capability. Historically, much of the capital investment in Northern White raw frac sand mines was\nused to develop coarser deposits in western Wisconsin. As such, we've seen competitors in the Northern White frac sand market reduce their capacity by shuttering or idling operations as the shift to finer sands in the liquid and oil plays erodes the ongoing economic viability of producing finer grades of sand.\nManagement's Outlook\nWe generally expect the price of raw frac sand to correlate with the level of drilling activity for oil and natural gas, although the increasing supply of sand could keep the price depressed. The willingness of exploration and production companies to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of oil and natural gas, the cost to drill, complete and operate a well, the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations, as well as their ability to acquire the sand at the wellsite. We generally expect the level of drilling to correlate with long-term trends in commodity prices. Similarly, oil and natural gas production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to correlate with drilling activity.\nOur sand is sold on a contract basis or through spot market pricing. Our long-term take-or-pay contracts reduce exposure to fluctuations in price and provide predictability of volumes and price over the contract term. By contrast, the spot market provides us with direct access to immediate prices, offering an outlet to sell excess production at opportunistic times or during favorable market conditions, which also comes with accompanying exposure to price volatility and uncertainty.\nGAAP Results of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017: Table 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentage change)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expenses):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,816\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expenses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,069\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,081\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,809\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(282\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,838\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue was $212.5 million ($70.94 per ton) for the year ended December 31, 2018, during which we sold approximately 2,995,000 tons of sand. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $137.2 million ($56.03 per ton), during which we sold approximately 2,449,000 tons of sand. Revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices.\nThe key factors contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sand sales revenue increased to $143.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to increased sales volumes and higher average selling prices.

The increase in transportation revenue was due to the increased sales volumes in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of increased exploration and production activity in the oil and natural gas industry as well as our increased in-basin sales activity generated from our Van Hook terminal which began operations in April 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold was $144.9 million and $100.3 million, or $48.38 and $40.96 per ton sold, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cost of goods sold and per ton cost of goods sold increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher sales volumes, which led to increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, and increased freight charges. Freight charges, which consist of transportation costs and railcar rental and storage expense, were $84.4 million and $59.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $24.7 million increase in freight costs was due primarily to increased tons sold and increased in-basin activities. Additionally, we incurred $20.9 million and $9.3 million of operating labor costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $11.6 million increase in labor costs was due primarily to additional contract staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility. Depreciation, depletion and accretion included in cost of goods sold were $16.3 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $67.6 million and $36.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to higher sales volumes, including in-basin and spot sales, and higher average selling prices, partially offset by increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, along with increased transportation charges.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $41.7 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Operating expenses are primarily comprised of wages and benefits, professional services fees and other administrative expenses. An impairment charge of $17.8 related to goodwill and an other indefinite-lived intangible asset was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. The impairment charge relates primarily to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet. Additionally, salaries, benefits and payroll taxes were $11.0 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The approximate $2.8 million increase was primarily due to additional headcount in 2018 as compared to 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of well-site storage solution acquisition-related costs and royalty payments relating to our Texas land leases. We recorded a decrease in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration, which resulted in an offset to operating expenses in the amount of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for our acquisition of Quickthree.\nOther Income (Expense)\nWe incurred $2.3 million and $0.5 million of net interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to borrowings under the Credit Facility to fund acquisition activity. Interest expense in 2017 was derived primarily from deferred finance fees and unused line fees for the Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We recorded a tax benefit of approximately $8.5 million due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the Tax Reform Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our effective tax rate was approximately 21.5% and (15.0)%, respectively, based on the statutory federal rate net of discrete federal and state taxes. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 benefited from the decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35.0% in 2017 to 21.0% in 2018. The computation of the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 included modifications for income tax credits, among other items. The computation for the year ended December 31, 2017 also included a benefit related to share-based compensation and the domestic production activities deduction ( DPAD\u201d). The DPAD was repealed for tax years beginning after January 1, 2018 under the Tax Reform Act. The computation for 2017 also included the impact of depletion method change for tax purposes on our prior year returns.\nThe Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, repealing the deduction for domestic production activities and implementing 100% direct expensing of certain non-residential property. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted.\nFor the year of 2018, we recorded a net operating loss for tax purposes due to the significant amount of capital expenditures, which are eligible for 100% expensing available under the Tax Reform Act. There are additional provisions in the Tax Reform Act that could impact us that will continue to be monitored as additional guidance is released and any necessary adjustments will be recorded in the period that the guidance is released.\nNet Income\nNet income was $18.7 million for year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net income was primarily due to an impairment charge of $17.8 million related to goodwill and an other indefinite-lived intangible asset was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. The impairment charge relates primarily to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet. Increased sales volumes during 2018 and favorable pricing trends in the first half of the year led to higher gross profit which partially offset the impairment charge.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016: Table 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentage change)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>100,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>36,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes\n</td> <td>8,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>9,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>18,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>18,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expenses):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred stock interest expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,862\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expenses), net\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(421\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(97\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,051\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>18,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,056\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(2,809\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,203\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue was $137.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, during which we sold approximately 2,449,000 tons of sand. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $59.2 million, during which we sold approximately 826,000 tons of sand. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to improved market conditions and higher sales volumes (including spot sales) in 2017, partially offset by lower average selling prices due to reservation revenue being spread over a larger amount of contractual volumes sold in 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe key factors contributing to the increase in revenues and decrease in average revenue per ton for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sand sales revenue increased to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Reservation and contractual shortfall revenues were $15.0 million and $20.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Shortfall revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from three customers that were unable to meet the take-or-pay requirements for their respective contract year. Certain customers were required to pay a fixed-price monthly reservation charge based on a minimum contractual volume over the remaining life of their contract, which are then credited against any applicable shortfall payments. With respect to shortfall revenues, our customer contracts dictated whether customers were invoiced quarterly or at the end of their respective contract year for shortfall payments. We recognized revenue to the extent of the unfulfilled minimum contracted quantity at the shortfall price per ton as stated in the contract once payment was received or was reasonably assured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Transportation revenue, which included railcar rental, was approximately $49.1 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 increasing from $6.7 million to $55.8 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ndue to higher freight pass-through charges billed to our customers. Railcar rental revenue was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing by approximately $2.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in the number of railcars rented to our customers under long-term contracts.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold was $100.3 million and $26.6 million, or $40.96 and $32.30 per ton sold, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of goods sold and per ton cost of goods sold increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher sales volumes, which led to increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, and increased freight charges. Freight charges, which consist of transportation costs and railcar rental and storage expense, were $59.7 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $50.0 million increase in freight costs was due primarily to increased tons sold and increased in-basin activities and customer sales with pass-through freight. Additionally, we incurred $9.3 million and $5.2 million of operating labor costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $4.1 million increase in labor costs was due to additional staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility and its operations. Depreciation, depletion and accretion included in cost of goods sold account for $7.3 million and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $36.9 million and $32.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased sales volumes and higher reservation revenue as compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher cost of goods sold and lower shortfall revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $18.2 million and $12.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Operating expenses are primarily comprised of wages and benefits, professional services fees and other administrative expenses. Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes were $8.2 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The approximate $0.8 million increase was primarily due to additional employee headcount and stock compensation grants in 2017 compared to 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $5.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of additional insurance, consulting and legal costs incurred as a publicly traded corporation as well as increased development activity.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest on the Series A Preferred Stock accounted for $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The paid-in-kind interest was added to the outstanding balance of the Preferred Stock. On November 9, 2016, the Series A Preferred Stock was fully redeemed and our former revolving credit facility was paid in full and terminated using a portion of the proceeds from IPO. We incurred $0.5 million and $2.9 million of interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest expense in 2017 was derived primarily from deferred finance fees and unused line fees for our Credit Facility. Interest expense in 2016 was derived primarily from interest on our former revolving credit facility. Additional items included in interest expense included the accretion of common stock issued and transaction costs incurred in conjunction with the September 2011 Securities Purchase Agreement, deferred financing fees, and interest incurred on capital leases. No borrowings were drawn against our Credit Facility in 2017. Other income was $0.5 million and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017, we recognized other income of approximately $1.9 million related to the settlement of our unsecured bankruptcy claim with a former customer and $6.6 million related to the sale of our unsecured bankruptcy claim with the same customer.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax benefit was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to income tax expense of $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our statutory tax rate and effective tax rate were approximately 35.0% and (15.0)%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our statutory tax rate and effective tax rate were approximately 35.0% and 48.0%, respectively. The difference in these tax rates for both 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to state income tax, non-deductible interest expense on the Preferred Stock costs associated with our initial public offering process. The computation of the 2017 effective tax rate includes modifications for share-based compensation, domestic manufacturing deduction, and state income tax credit among others. The computation for 2017 included the impact of depletion method change for tax purposes on our prior year returns. The effective rate was also impacted by tax reform signed into law in 2017, as indicated below. The computation for 2016 also included modifications for non-deductible interest expense on the Series A Preferred Stock. The primary drivers of the difference between the effective rates in 2017 and 2016 was the full\nredemption of the Series A Preferred Stock in November 2016, the method of calculating depletion for tax purposes and tax reform.\nAs a result of the Tax Reform Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. There are additional provisions in the Tax Reform Act that could impact us that will continue to be monitored as additional guidance is released. The tax benefit represents provisional amounts and our current best estimates.\nNet Income\nNet income was $21.5 million for year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher volumes sold and higher reservation revenue, offset by lower shortfall revenue, increased salaries and employee headcount, and additional costs incurred as a result of being publicly traded corporation. Additionally, net income was positively impacted by lower interest expense due to the full redemption of Series A Preferred Stock in November 2016, no debt outstanding on our Credit Facility and the income tax benefit recognized as a result of the Tax Reform Act.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and contribution margin are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and gross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or contribution margin in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and contribution margin may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as net income, plus: (i) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; (ii) income tax expense (benefit); (iii) interest expense; and (iv) franchise taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus: (i) gain or loss on sale of fixed assets or discontinued operations; (ii) integration and transition costs associated with specified transactions; (iii) equity compensation; (iv) acquisition and development costs; (v) non-recurring cash charges related to restructuring, retention and other similar actions; (vi) earn-out, contingent consideration obligations and other acquisition and development costs; and (vii) non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring charges.

The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to higher sales volumes, including in-basin sales, and higher average selling prices, partially offset by increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, along with increased transportation charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, resulted from decreased shortfall revenue and increased cost of goods sold due to higher sales volumes and the increased in-basin activities from customer sales with pass-through freight and the additional staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility.\nContribution Margin\nWe also use contribution margin, which we define as total revenues less costs of goods sold excluding depreciation, depletion and accretion of asset retirement obligations, to measure our financial and operating performance. Contribution margin excludes other operating expenses and income, including costs not directly associated with the operations of our business such as accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, sales and other administrative activities.\nHistorically, we have reported production costs and production cost per ton as non-GAAP financial measures. As we expand our logistics activities and continue to sell sand closer to the wellhead, our sand production costs will only be a portion of our overall cost structure.\nWe believe that a transition to reporting contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold will provide a better performance metric to management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, because these metrics provide an operating and financial measure of our ability, as a combined business, to generate margin in excess of our operating cost base. As such, we believe that it is no longer relevant to report production costs or production costs per ton on a standalone basis.\nGross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin. Contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to gross profit presented in accordance with GAAP. Because contribution margin may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of contribution margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of contribution margin to gross profit.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>144,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>67,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, and accretion of asset retirement obligations included in cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>16,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Contribution margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Contribution margin per ton\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total tons sold\n</td> <td>2,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContribution margin was $83.9 million, or $28.00 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $44.2 million, or $18.05 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the increased sales volumes overall as well as increased in-basin sales volumes through our Van Hook terminal, which began operations in April 2018, coupled with favorable pricing trends in the first half of 2018. These positive sales volumes and pricing trends in the first half of 2018 more than compensated for reduced demand and pricing in the second half of 2018.\nContribution margin was $44.2 million, or $18.05 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $38.7 million, or $46.90 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in contribution margin per ton in 2017 was primarily due to significantly increased sales volumes and increased cost of goods sold with the inclusion of pass-through freight from customers with increased in-basin activities and additional staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCurrently, our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. Based on our balance sheet, cash flows, current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity, which includes our Credit Facility and other available capital resources, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including investing in our wellsite proppant storage solutions and other capital projects, while rightsizing our labor and equipment costs. Going forward, we expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nOn November 9, 2016, we consummated the IPO of 11.7 million shares of common stock at a price of $11.00 per share, generating net proceeds to us of $128.7 million before underwriting discounts and expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to redeem all of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our former revolving credit facility, which was terminated. We used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn February 1, 2017, we consummated a follow-on offering and sale of 1.5 million shares of common stock at a price of $17.50 per share, generating net proceeds to us of $24.3 million before underwriting discounts and expenses. We used the proceeds from this offering for capital projects and general corporate services.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is a measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. The following table presents the components of our working capital as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current liabilities\n</td> <td>24,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur working capital was $25.4 million at December 31, 2018 compared to working capital of $38.6 million at December 31, 2017. In 2018 our shortfall revenue increased near year-end, which resulted in increased accounts receivable and unbilled receivables. We also used existing cash on hand and proceeds from our Credit Facility to substantially complete the Oakdale expansion and to acquire Quickthree and the assets at the Van Hook terminal. In 2017, we closed on an equity offering of 1.5 million shares of our common stock, generating net proceeds of approximately $24.2 million.\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations and capital projects for at least the next twelve months.\nLiquidity\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(125,989\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $50.9 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Operating cash flows include net income of $18.7 million and $21.5 million in net earnings generated from the sale of frac sand to our customers in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, partially offset by higher cost of production, general and administrative expenses and interest, adjusted for changes in working capital.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.6 million and $26.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Operating cash flows include net income of $21.5 million and $10.4 million in net earnings generated from the sale of frac sand to our customers in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, partially offset by higher cost of production, general and administrative expenses and cash interest expense, adjusted for changes in working capital.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $126.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $74.9 million increase was primarily the result of our acquisitions of the Van Hook terminal, Quickthree, and capital expenditures related to the completion of the Oakdale expansion project which began in 2017.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $48.6 million increase was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures related primarily to the expansion of our processing facilities in Oakdale, Wisconsin.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily related to net draws on our Credit Facility of $44.5 million partially offset by repurchases of our common shares of $2.2 million and repayments of notes payable of $0.6 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included net proceeds from equity issuance of $24.2 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included net proceeds from equity issuance of $127.3 million, offset by net repayments of $64.2 million under our former revolving credit facility and $40.3 million of Series A Preferred Stock.\nIndebtedness\nCredit Facility\nWe have total borrowing capacity of $60.0 million on our Credit Facility. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral. In February 2019, we entered into an agreement with the existing lenders on our Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility to June 30, 2020 and also to reduce the total capacity to $50.0 million by December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had $15.5 million in total undrawn availability under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility contains various reporting requirements, negative covenants and restrictive provisions and requires maintenance of financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio (each as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nNotes Payable\nWe have entered into various financing arrangements to support the manufacturing of our wellsite proppant storage solutions equipment with interest rates between 6.48% and 7.49%. Title to the equipment is held by the financial institutions as collateral, though the equipment is included in the Company's property plant and equipment.\nCapital Leases\nWe have entered into various financing arrangements to finance equipment used in the operations of our business with interest rates between 6.80% - 7.10%. Equipment with a cost of $657 and $1,484 has been capitalized and included in the Company's property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCapital Requirements\nThe Company estimates that full year 2019 capital expenditures will be approximately $30 million to $40 million, excluding any additional acquisitions.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases at prevailing market prices or through privately negotiated transactions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. On November 8, 2018, the Company announced that the board of directors had approved the Company to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock during the twelve-month period following the announcement of the share repurchase program. At December 31, 2018, the maximum number of shares that the Company may repurchase under the current repurchase authority was 1,411,800 shares.\nThe following table presents specified information about the Company's repurchases of ordinary shares for the year ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>588,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average price per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate repurchase cost (including broker costs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 2.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe program allows the Company to repurchase shares at its discretion. Market conditions, price, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, and other economic conditions will influence the timing of the repurchase and the number of shares repurchased, if any. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements, may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had $8.6 million of outstanding performance bonds at each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable\n</td> <td>3,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>13,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment, railcar and office leases\n</td> <td>38,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land lease obligations\n</td> <td>42,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Facility\n</td> <td>44,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, environmental contamination and reclamation and the protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact the production levels at our wet processing plant. While our dry plants are able to process finished product volumes evenly throughout the year, our excavation and our wet sand processing activities have historically been limited to primarily non-winter months. As a consequence, we have experienced lower cash operating costs in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year, and higher cash operating costs in the second and third quarter of each calendar year when we overproduced to meet demand in the winter months. These higher cash operating costs were capitalized into inventory and expensed when these tons are sold, which can lead to us having higher overall cost of production in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year as we expense inventory costs that were previously capitalized. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we finished construction of a new wet plant, which is an indoor facility that allows us to produce wet sand inventory year-round to support a portion of our dry sand processing capacity, which may reduce certain of the effects of this seasonality. We may also sell raw frac sand for use in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, our sales volumes to those areas may be reduced during such severe weather periods.\nCustomer Concentration\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to Liberty, EQT, WPX Energy, and Hess accounted for 22.8%, 21.4%, 11.6%, and 10.6%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to Rice Energy, Liberty, Weatherford, and U.S. Well Services accounted for 27.1%, 20.6%, 13.7%, and 10.2%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to EOG Resources, Weatherford, US Well Services, and C&J Energy Services accounted for 37.5%, 25.2%, 22.4%, and 10.8%, respectively, of total revenue.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally acceptable in the United States of\nAmerica. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nListed below are the accounting policies we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved, and that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and all the related amendments to ASC 606 in relation to all contracts that were not completed or expired as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. There was no adjustment made to the opening balance of retained earnings as a result of applying ASC 606. Results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while the comparative information is not restated and will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, the amount of which reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured, and the risk of loss is transferred to the customer.\nUnder current and former revenue standards, this generally means that sales are FCA, payment made at the origination point at our facility, and title passes as the product is loaded into railcars hired by the customer or provided by us. Deliveries of in-basin sand have shipping terms of FCA or DAT, payment made at the destination; and we recognize this revenue when the sand is received at the destination.\nWe derive our revenue by mining and processing sand that our customers purchase for various uses. Our revenues are primarily a function of the price per ton realized and the volumes sold. In some instances, our revenues also include transportation costs we charge to our customers, a monthly charge to reserve sand capacity and shortfall payments due from customers for minimum volume commitments. Our transportation revenue fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the volume of product we transport and the distance between our plant and our customers. Our reservation and shortfall revenue fluctuates based on negotiated contract terms.\nWe sell a limited amount of product under short-term price agreements or at prevailing market rates. The majority of our revenues are realized through long-term take-or-pay contracts. The expiration dates of these contracts range from 2019 through 2022. These agreements define, among other commitments, the volume of product that our customers must purchase, the volume of product that we must provide and the price that we will charge and that our customers will pay for each ton of contracted product. Prices under these agreements are generally indexed to WTI and subject to upward or downward adjustment, based upon: (i) annual percentage price increases; or (ii) market factor increases, including a natural gas surcharge/reduction and a propane surcharge/reduction which are applied if the Average Natural Gas Price or the Average Quarterly Mont Belvieu TX Propane Spot Price, respectively, as listed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, are above the benchmark set in the contract for the preceding calendar quarter. As a result, our realized prices may not grow at rates consistent with broader industry pricing. For example, during periods of rapid price growth, our realized prices may grow more slowly than those of competitors, and during periods of price decline, our realized prices may outperform industry averages. With respect to the take-or-pay arrangements, if the customer is not allowed to make up deficiencies, we recognize revenues to the extent of the minimum contracted quantity, assuming payment is reasonably assured, based on negotiated contract terms and when rights of use are expired, which is generally either quarterly or at the end of a customer contract year rather than ratably over the respective contract year. If deficiencies can be made up, receipts in excess of actual sales are recognized as deferred revenues until production is actually taken or the right to make up deficiencies expires.\nAccounts and Unbilled Receivables\nAccounts receivable represents customer transactions that have been invoiced as of the balance sheet date; unbilled receivables represent customer transactions that have not yet been invoiced as of the balance sheet date. Accounts receivable are due within 30 days, or in accordance with terms agreed upon with customers, and are stated at amounts due from customers net of any allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms past due. We determine the allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, previous loss history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation, and the condition of the general economy and the\nindustry as a whole. Accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to bad debt expense. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $42 and $0, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the portion of unbilled receivables included in deferred revenue was $578 and $0, respectively.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nWe estimate the future cost of dismantling, restoring and reclaiming operating excavation sites and related facilities in accordance with federal, state and local regulatory requirements and recognize reclamation obligations when extraction occurs and record them as liabilities at estimated fair value. In addition, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset is recorded and depreciated over such asset's useful life or the estimated number of years of extraction. The reclamation liability is accreted to expense over the estimated productive life of the related asset and is subject to adjustments to reflect changes in value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines or mining areas are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for more or less than the carrying amount of the liability, a loss or gain will be recognized, respectively.\nInventory Valuation\nSand inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. Costs applied to inventory include direct excavation costs, processing costs, overhead allocation, depreciation and depletion. Stockpile tonnages are calculated by measuring the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile. Tonnages are verified periodically by an independent surveyor. Costs are calculated on a per ton basis and are applied to the stockpiles based on the number of tons in the stockpile.\nSpare parts inventory includes critical spare parts. We account for spare parts on a first in first out basis, and value the inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nDepletion\nWe amortize the cost to acquire land and mineral rights using a units-of-production method, based on the total estimated reserves and tonnage extracted each period.\nImpairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets\nIn applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the remainder recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of December 31, and whenever indicators of impairment arise. The fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of December 31, and whenever indicators of impairment arise.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of its goodwill and the estimated fair value of the Company was in excess of its carrying value. To perform the test, we used valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of the Company as a single reporting unit under the income and market approaches. Under the discounted cash flow method, an income approach, the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debt-free after-tax cash flows for a finite period of years. Key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management, business risk, and expected rates of return on capital. The guideline company method, a market approach, develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies. Key estimates and selection of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies, obtaining estimates of forecast revenues and EBITDA estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics. Under the similar transactions method, a market approach, actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units is used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the Company. Following the fair value determination using the methods above, we conducted an evaluation of our stock price at or near the measurement date and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the fair value of the Company.\nWe periodically evaluate whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate future undiscounted net cash (without interest charges), estimated future sales prices (considering historical and current prices, price trends and related factors) and anticipated operating costs and capital expenditures. If the carrying value of our long-lived assets is less than the undiscounted cash flows, the assets are measured at fair value and an impairment is recorded if that fair value is less than the carrying value.\nOur estimates of prices, recoverable proven reserves and operating and capital costs are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of our long-lived assets. Although we have made our best estimate of these factors based on current conditions, it is reasonably possible that changes could occur, which could adversely affect our estimate of the net cash flows expected to be generated from our operating property. There were no impairment charges of our long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. We recorded an impairment charge of $17.8 million related to goodwill and an other indefinite-lived intangible asset for the year ended December 31, 2018. The impairment charge relates primarily to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet. We did not have goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2017 or 2016. There were no impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nUnder the balance sheet approach to provide for income taxes, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. If we determine it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the benefits of the deductible temporary differences, we record a valuation against the net deferred tax asset.\nWe recognize the impact of uncertain tax positions at the largest amount that, in our judgment, is more-likely-than-not to be required to be recognized upon examination by a taxing authority.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is recorded based upon the fair value of the award at grant date. Such costs are recognized as expense over the corresponding requisite service period. The fair value of the awards granted was calculated based on a weighted analysis of (i) publicly-traded companies in a similar line of business to us (market comparable method) and (ii) our discounted cash flows. The application of this valuation model involves inputs and assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the valuation of incentive awards, which affects compensation expense related to these awards. These inputs and assumptions include the value of a share of our common stock.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we used a combination of the guideline company approach and a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our stock. The key assumptions in this estimate included our projections of future cash flows, company-specific cost of capital used as a discount rate, lack of marketability discount, and qualitative factors to compare us to comparable guideline companies. During 2016, factors that contributed to changes in the underlying value of our stock included the continued market challenges and corresponding decline in oil and natural gas drilling activity, changes to future cash flows projected from the expansion of capacity, product mix, including mix of finer grade versus coarser grade sand, and other factors. As our operations are highly dependent on sales to the oil and natural gas industry, the market conditions for this industry had a high degree of impact on the company's value.\nOnce our shares became publicly traded, we began using the actual market price of our shares or an adjusted price using a Monte Carlo simulation for awards subject to the Company's performance as compared to a defined peer group as the grant date fair value for restricted stock awards.\nThe following is a summary of the restricted stock awards granted and the related grant date fair value in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nShares Granted\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the year ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company\u201d pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012. Section 102 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our election to opt-out\u201d of the extended transition period is irrevocable.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2017, the FASB issues ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which simplifies the test for goodwill impairment. To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the Board eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company adopted this standard on October 1, 2018 and has applied the new accounting standard to its annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2018.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which replaces the existing guidance in ASC 840, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities with corresponding right of use assets. The new lease standard does not substantially change lessor accounting. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company intends to adopt ASU 2016-02 and its related updates using the transition practical expedients, which allows the Company to use the existing lease population, classification and determination of initial direct costs when calculating the lease liability and right of use asset balances. The Company also intends to use the optional transition method, which allows the Company to initially apply the new standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company has implemented new accounting policies and software to facilitate the recording and reporting of lease transactions and balances. The Company will record initial right of use assets and related liabilities of approximately $36 million on its consolidated balance sheet on January 1, 2019. Significant new disclosures in the notes to the financial statements will be added in the first quarterly report of 2019. The Company does not expect there to be a material impact on the other consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Item 6, Selected Financial Data,\u201d Item 1, Business,\u201d and the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Item 1, Business-Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this report. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nFactors Impacting Comparability of Our Financial Results\nOur historical results of operations and cash flows are not indicative of results of operations and cash flows to be expected in the future, principally for the following reasons:\n \u2022 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible asset. In 2018 we recorded an impairment of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset in the amount of $17.8 million, which was recorded as an operating expense on the consolidated income statement. The impairment charge reduced our earnings per share by $0.44 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018. See our discussion in the GAAP Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017: Operating Expenses\u201d for additional information regarding this transaction. \n \u2022 Expansion of our Oakdale facility. In May 2018, we completed an expansion project to increase our nameplate processing capacity at our Oakdale facility from 3.3 million tons per year to 5.5 million tons per year. \n \u2022 We have increased our deliveries of sand to the basins. In 2018, a greater portion of the raw frac sand that we sold was delivered directly to the basins. This results in higher average selling prices along with additional costs related to such delivery. \n \u2022 Market Trends. Demand for proppants through the first half of 2016 decreased due to the downturn in commodity prices originating in late 2014 and the corresponding reduction in oil and natural gas drilling, completion and production activity. The change in demand during this period impacted contract discussions and negotiated terms with our customers as existing contracts were adjusted, resulting in a combination of reduced average selling prices per ton, and adjustments to take-or-pay volumes and lengths of contracts. During the market downturn, customers began to purchase more volumes on a spot basis as compared to committing to long-term contracts, and this trend continued until oil and natural gas drilling and completion activity began to increase beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. From early 2017 through the second quarter of 2018, improvements in oil and natural gas prices created a more stable market environment. During the second half of 2018, the demand for Northern White sand decreased, which we believe was due primarily to insufficient takeaway capacity for the incremental oil and natural gas production coming online in the Permian Basin, along with increased availability of regional sand as a source of proppant in the Permian basin. Additionally, oil and natural gas companies reduced their spending in the latter portion of the year due to strong spending in the first half of 2018 and lower oil prices, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our spot sales continued at decreased rates through the second half of 2018, and we have agreed to temporary price adjustments under certain of our long-term agreements. In general, we have received a term extension in exchange for such price adjustments. Otherwise, the contractual terms under our long-term agreements have not changed materially. In general, customers under long-term take or pay contracts are required to make periodic shortfall payments, which we recognize as revenue in our results of operations in the period in which the obligation becomes due. Contracted volumes have decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting in additional shortfall revenue. \nOverview\nWe are a fully integrated frac sand supply and services company, offering complete mine to wellsite solutions for our customers. We produce low-cost, high quality Northern White raw frac sand, which is a premium proppant used to enhance hydrocarbon recovery rates in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. We also offer proppant logistics solutions to our customers through our in-basin transloading terminal and wellsite storage capabilities. We currently market our products and services primarily to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and oilfield service companies and sell our\nproducts under a combination of long-term take-or-pay contracts and spot sales in the open market. We believe that the size and favorable geologic characteristics of our sand reserves, the strategic location and logistical advantages of our facilities, our proprietary portable wellsite storage solutions and the industry experience of our senior management team have positioned us as a highly attractive provider of raw frac sand and proppant logistics services from the mine to the wellsite.\nWe own and operate a raw frac sand mine and related processing facility near Oakdale, Wisconsin, at which we have approximately 317 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves as of December 31, 2018. We incorporated in Delaware in July 2011 and began operations with 1.1 million tons of annual nameplate processing capacity in July 2012. After several expansions, our current annual nameplate processing capacity at our Oakdale facility is approximately 5.5 million tons of raw frac sand per year. Our integrated Oakdale facility, with onsite rail infrastructure and wet and dry sand processing facilities, has access to two Class I rail lines, which enables us to process and cost effectively deliver products to our customers.\nRecent Developments\nWellsite Storage Solutions\nOn June 1, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Quickthree Solutions, Inc. ( Quickthree\u201d), a manufacturer of portable vertical proppant storage solution systems. The consideration for the transaction consisted of approximately $30.0 million in cash, which was paid at closing using cash on hand and advances under the Credit Facility, and up to $12.8 million in potential earn-out payments, which are to be paid as system components are built and made available for sale or lease over the three-year period from the acquisition date. We believe that this acquisition provides us the technology, production capacity and management team to compete further in the proppant logistics market and will provide us with an opportunity to expand our customer base by being able to offer proppant logistics services all the way to the wellsite.\nVan Hook Transload Terminal\nOn March 15, 2018, we acquired the rights to operate a multi-unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota to service the Bakken Formation, in the Williston Basin. We paid consideration of approximately $15.5 million to acquire certain assets at the Van Hook terminal, and entered into a long-term lease agreement in connection with the transaction. As part of this transaction, we entered into a long-term agreement with Canadian Pacific Railway to service the Van Hook terminal directly along with the other key oil and natural gas exploration and production basins of North America. The Van Hook terminal became operational in April 2018. Since operations have commenced, we have been providing Northern White sand in-basin at this terminal to our customers. We believe this new terminal provides us with an opportunity to expand our customer base and offer more efficient delivery options to customers operating in the Williston Basin.\nAssets and Operations\nOakdale\nOur sand reserves include a balanced concentration of coarse sand, (19% 20/40 and coarser), finer sand (41% of 40/70 mesh) and fine sand (40% 60/140 gradation, which we refer to in this annual report as 100 mesh\u201d). Our 30/50 gradation is a derivative of the 20/40 and 40/70 blends. We believe that this mix of coarse and fine sand reserves, combined with contractual demand for our products across a range of mesh sizes, provides us with relatively higher mining yields and lower processing costs than frac sand mines with predominantly coarse sand reserves. In addition, our approximate 317 million tons of proven recoverable reserves implies a reserve life of approximately 58 years based on our current annual nameplate processing capacity of 5.5 million tons. This long reserve life enables us to better serve demand for different types of raw frac sand as compared to mines with shorter reserve lives.\nOur Oakdale facility is purpose-built to exploit the reserve profile in place and produce high-quality raw frac sand. Unlike some of our competitors, our primary processing and rail loading facilities are located in close proximity to the mine site, which limits the need for us to truck sand on public roads between the mine and the production facility or between wet and dry processing facilities. Our on-site transportation assets include approximately nine miles of rail track in a triple-loop configuration and four railcar loading facilities that are connected to a Class I rail line owned by Canadian Pacific. This enables us to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains and significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers' raw frac sand transportation needs. With the addition of our unit train capable transload facility approximately three miles from the Oakdale facility in Byron Township, Wisconsin, we also have the ability to ship sand to our customers on the Union Pacific network. We believe that we are the only sand facility in Wisconsin that has dual served rail capabilities, which should create competition among our rail carriers and allow us to provide more competitive logistics options for our customers.\nDue to sustained freezing temperatures in our area of operation during winter months, we have historically halted the operation of our wet plant for approximately three to five months. As a result, we have excavated and washed sand in excess of\ncurrent delivery requirements during the months when the wet plant was operational. This excess sand is placed in stockpiles that feed the dry plants and enable us to fill customer orders throughout the year without interruption. Our second wet plant facility, brought online in the fourth quarter of 2017, is enclosed, which allows us to operate at full capacity during the winter months.\nLogistics\nThrough our acquisitions of the transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota and a manufacturer of portable vertical frac sand storage systems, we have expanded our logistics capabilities. We now provide Northern White sand in-basin to customers operating in the Williston Basin and we have the technology, production capacity and management team to compete further in the raw frac sand supply chain for our customers by offering logistics services all the way to the wellsite.\nWe intend to continue expanding our footprint in-basin through the addition of one or more terminals in other oil and natural gas operating basins while expanding our wellsite storage solutions fleets. Benefits of our long-term growth strategy for in-basin delivery of sand include new contracted customers by marketing through our own terminal, more opportunity for spot sales by forward deploying sand and the opportunity to capture incremental margin on the sale of sand farther down the supply chain by managing the cost of rail and terminal operations. Additionally, having a presence in-basin gives us an opportunity to have a base of operations from which to market our wellsite solutions. We believe our key differentiators in our wellsite storage solutions are:\n i. our portable silos can be set up or taken down rapidly; \n ii. our trailers detach, which reduces their footprint; \n iii. our storage silos include industry-leading passive and active dust suppression technology; and \n iv. our patented system is the only one of its kind that has the capability of a gravity-fed operation and when used in combination with our Quickload system, our silos can be filled by both pneumatic and gravity dump trailers.  Through the expansion of our wellsite storage solutions fleet and the addition of one or more terminals, we continue evaluating ways to reduce the landed cost of our products in-basin and to the wellsite for our customers while increasing our customized service offerings to provide our customers with additional delivery and pricing alternatives, including selling product on an as-delivered\u201d basis to the wellsite.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nWe generate revenue by excavating and processing frac sand, which we sell to our customers under long-term price agreements or as spot sales at prevailing market rates. In some instances, revenues also include a charge for transportation services provided to customers. Our transportation revenue fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the volume of product transported and the distance between the plant and our customers.\nWe have entered into long-term take-or-pay contracts with customers that are intended to mitigate our exposure to the potential price volatility of the spot market for raw frac sand and to enhance the stability of our cash flows. Our contracts contain a minimum volume purchase requirement and provides for delivery of raw frac sand FCA at our Oakdale facility, our Van Hook transloading terminal in the Bakken, or another location specified by our customers. As of March 1, 2019, we have approximately 58.7% of our current annual nameplate production capacity contracted under eight long-term take-or-pay contracts with a weighted average life of approximately two years.\nRevenue is generally recognized FCA, payment made at the origination point at our facility, and title passes as the product is loaded into railcars hired by the customer or provided by us. Certain contracted and spot-rate customers have shipping terms of FCA, DAT or DAP, payment made at the destination, for which we recognize revenue when the sand is delivered.\nCosts of Conducting Our Business\nThe principal direct costs involved in operating our business are labor, maintenance, utility costs, equipment and excavation. We incur labor costs associated with employees at our processing facility represent the most significant cost of converting raw frac sand to finished product. Our Oakdale facility undergoes maintenance to minimize unscheduled downtime and ensure the ongoing quality of our raw frac sand. We incur utility costs in connection with the operation of our processing facility, primarily electricity and natural gas, which are both susceptible to market fluctuations. We lease equipment in many areas of our operations including our plants, mining equipment and logistics services. Excavation costs with respect to the excavation of sand and other materials from which we ultimately do not derive revenue. However, the ratio of rejected\nmaterials to total amounts excavated has been, and we believe will continue to be, in line with our expectations, given the extensive core sampling and other testing we undertook at the Oakdale facility. In addition, other costs include processing costs, overhead allocation, depreciation and depletion are capitalized as a component of inventory and are reflected in cost of goods sold when inventory is sold.\nOverall Trends and Outlook\nDemand Trends\nAccording to Spears, the North American proppant market, including raw frac sand, ceramic and resin-coated proppant, was approximately 98 million tons in 2018, which is a 33% increase over the 74 million tons Spears reported for 2017. Spears estimates that 2019 demand will increase 4% and 2020 demand will increase another 14%, representing an increase of approximately 25 million tons in proppant demand over the next two years.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019E\n</td> <td>2020E\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New US Horizontal Wells\n</td> <td>20,819\n</td> <td>14,413\n</td> <td>8,599\n</td> <td>13,116\n</td> <td>15,691\n</td> <td>14,840\n</td> <td>15,233\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proppant Demand (Mil Tons)\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>120\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDemand growth for raw frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by advancements in oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. These advancements have made the extraction of oil and natural gas increasingly cost-effective in formations that historically would have been uneconomic to develop. More proppant is being used per well, which is driving the increase in proppant demand despite horizontal drilling activity stabilizing. Spears estimates that proppant demand will reach approximately 101 million tons in 2019 and 120 million tons in 2020. Spears also estimates that average proppant usage per well was approximately 5,800 tons per well in 2018 and will rise to approximately 7,400 tons per well by the end of 2020.\nSupply Trends\nIn 2018, significant capacity was added in numerous regions. The total mine capacity outpaced customer demand for raw frac sand leading to an over supplied market which has put pricing pressure on high-quality raw frac sand. Several factors contributing to this supply surplus include over-development of new sand mines in response to the prior year shortage, an increase in the usage of local sand, and logistical challenges on delivering sand in the higher quantities required by the new higher proppant intensity wells.\nSupplies of high-quality Northern White raw frac sand are limited to select areas, predominantly in western Wisconsin and limited areas of Minnesota and Illinois. The ability to obtain large contiguous reserves in these areas is a key constraint and can be an important supply consideration when assessing the economic viability of a potential raw frac sand facility. Further constraining the supply and throughput of Northern White raw frac sand is that not all of the large reserve mines have onsite excavation and processing capability. Historically, much of the capital investment in Northern White raw frac sand mines was\nused to develop coarser deposits in western Wisconsin. As such, we've seen competitors in the Northern White frac sand market reduce their capacity by shuttering or idling operations as the shift to finer sands in the liquid and oil plays erodes the ongoing economic viability of producing finer grades of sand.\nManagement's Outlook\nWe generally expect the price of raw frac sand to correlate with the level of drilling activity for oil and natural gas, although the increasing supply of sand could keep the price depressed. The willingness of exploration and production companies to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of oil and natural gas, the cost to drill, complete and operate a well, the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations, as well as their ability to acquire the sand at the wellsite. We generally expect the level of drilling to correlate with long-term trends in commodity prices. Similarly, oil and natural gas production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to correlate with drilling activity.\nOur sand is sold on a contract basis or through spot market pricing. Our long-term take-or-pay contracts reduce exposure to fluctuations in price and provide predictability of volumes and price over the contract term. By contrast, the spot market provides us with direct access to immediate prices, offering an outlet to sell excess production at opportunistic times or during favorable market conditions, which also comes with accompanying exposure to price volatility and uncertainty.\nGAAP Results of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017: Table 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentage change)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expenses):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,816\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expenses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,069\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,081\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,809\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(282\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,838\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue was $212.5 million ($70.94 per ton) for the year ended December 31, 2018, during which we sold approximately 2,995,000 tons of sand. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $137.2 million ($56.03 per ton), during which we sold approximately 2,449,000 tons of sand. Revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices.\nThe key factors contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 were as follows:\n \u2022 Sand sales revenue increased to $143.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to increased sales volumes and higher average selling prices. Tons sold increased by 22.3% resulting from increased exploration and production activity in the oil and natural gas industry in 2018 compared to 2017. \n \u2022 Average selling price per ton increased to $47.76 for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $32.74 for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to increased volumes and higher average selling prices related to increased in-basin sand sales volumes, which are sold at a higher price than sand sold at the mine gate and favorable price adjustments under certain of our take-or-pay contracts based upon the Average Cushing Oklahoma WTI Spot Prices. \n \u2022 We had $6.0 million in contractual shortfall revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Our customer contracts dictate whether customers are invoiced quarterly or at the end of their respective contract year for shortfall payments. We recognize revenue to the extent of the unfulfilled minimum contracted quantity at the shortfall price per ton as stated in the contract once payment is received or reasonably assured. \n \u2022 Transportation revenue, which includes freight for certain mine gate sand sales and railcar usage, increased approximately $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing from $55.8 million to $62.9 million. The increase in transportation revenue was due to the increased sales volumes in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of increased exploration and production activity in the oil and natural gas industry as well as our increased in-basin sales activity generated from our Van Hook terminal which began operations in April 2018.  Cost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold was $144.9 million and $100.3 million, or $48.38 and $40.96 per ton sold, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cost of goods sold and per ton cost of goods sold increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher sales volumes, which led to increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, and increased freight charges. Freight charges, which consist of transportation costs and railcar rental and storage expense, were $84.4 million and $59.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $24.7 million increase in freight costs was due primarily to increased tons sold and increased in-basin activities. Additionally, we incurred $20.9 million and $9.3 million of operating labor costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $11.6 million increase in labor costs was due primarily to additional contract staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility. Depreciation, depletion and accretion included in cost of goods sold were $16.3 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $67.6 million and $36.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to higher sales volumes, including in-basin and spot sales, and higher average selling prices, partially offset by increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, along with increased transportation charges.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $41.7 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Operating expenses are primarily comprised of wages and benefits, professional services fees and other administrative expenses. An impairment charge of $17.8 related to goodwill and an other indefinite-lived intangible asset was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. The impairment charge relates primarily to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet. Additionally, salaries, benefits and payroll taxes were $11.0 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The approximate $2.8 million increase was primarily due to additional headcount in 2018 as compared to 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of well-site storage solution acquisition-related costs and royalty payments relating to our Texas land leases. We recorded a decrease in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration, which resulted in an offset to operating expenses in the amount of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for our acquisition of Quickthree.\nOther Income (Expense)\nWe incurred $2.3 million and $0.5 million of net interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to borrowings under the Credit Facility to fund acquisition activity. Interest expense in 2017 was derived primarily from deferred finance fees and unused line fees for the Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We recorded a tax benefit of approximately $8.5 million due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the Tax Reform Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our effective tax rate was approximately 21.5% and (15.0)%, respectively, based on the statutory federal rate net of discrete federal and state taxes. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 benefited from the decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35.0% in 2017 to 21.0% in 2018. The computation of the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 included modifications for income tax credits, among other items. The computation for the year ended December 31, 2017 also included a benefit related to share-based compensation and the domestic production activities deduction ( DPAD\u201d). The DPAD was repealed for tax years beginning after January 1, 2018 under the Tax Reform Act. The computation for 2017 also included the impact of depletion method change for tax purposes on our prior year returns.\nThe Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, repealing the deduction for domestic production activities and implementing 100% direct expensing of certain non-residential property. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted.\nFor the year of 2018, we recorded a net operating loss for tax purposes due to the significant amount of capital expenditures, which are eligible for 100% expensing available under the Tax Reform Act. There are additional provisions in the Tax Reform Act that could impact us that will continue to be monitored as additional guidance is released and any necessary adjustments will be recorded in the period that the guidance is released.\nNet Income\nNet income was $18.7 million for year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net income was primarily due to an impairment charge of $17.8 million related to goodwill and an other indefinite-lived intangible asset was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. The impairment charge relates primarily to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet. Increased sales volumes during 2018 and favorable pricing trends in the first half of the year led to higher gross profit which partially offset the impairment charge.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016: Table 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentage change)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>100,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>36,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes\n</td> <td>8,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>9,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>18,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>18,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expenses):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred stock interest expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,862\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expenses), net\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(421\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(97\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,051\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>18,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,056\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(2,809\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,203\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue was $137.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, during which we sold approximately 2,449,000 tons of sand. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $59.2 million, during which we sold approximately 826,000 tons of sand. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to improved market conditions and higher sales volumes (including spot sales) in 2017, partially offset by lower average selling prices due to reservation revenue being spread over a larger amount of contractual volumes sold in 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe key factors contributing to the increase in revenues and decrease in average revenue per ton for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\n \u2022 Sand sales revenue increased to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Tons sold increased by 196% as exploration and production activity in the oil and natural gas industry improved in 2017 compared to 2016. \n \u2022 Average selling price per ton, which includes reservation charges, decreased to $32.74 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $38.28 for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to increased volumes, which led to reservation charges being allocated to a greater number of tons sold; and \n \u2022 Reservation and contractual shortfall revenues were $30.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Shortfall revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from two customers that were unable to meet the take-or-pay requirements for their respective contract year. Reservation and contractual shortfall revenues were $15.0 million and $20.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Shortfall revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from three customers that were unable to meet the take-or-pay requirements for their respective contract year. Certain customers were required to pay a fixed-price monthly reservation charge based on a minimum contractual volume over the remaining life of their contract, which are then credited against any applicable shortfall payments. With respect to shortfall revenues, our customer contracts dictated whether customers were invoiced quarterly or at the end of their respective contract year for shortfall payments. We recognized revenue to the extent of the unfulfilled minimum contracted quantity at the shortfall price per ton as stated in the contract once payment was received or was reasonably assured. \n \u2022 Transportation revenue, which included railcar rental, was approximately $49.1 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 increasing from $6.7 million to $55.8 million \ndue to higher freight pass-through charges billed to our customers. Railcar rental revenue was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing by approximately $2.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in the number of railcars rented to our customers under long-term contracts.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold was $100.3 million and $26.6 million, or $40.96 and $32.30 per ton sold, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of goods sold and per ton cost of goods sold increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher sales volumes, which led to increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, and increased freight charges. Freight charges, which consist of transportation costs and railcar rental and storage expense, were $59.7 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $50.0 million increase in freight costs was due primarily to increased tons sold and increased in-basin activities and customer sales with pass-through freight. Additionally, we incurred $9.3 million and $5.2 million of operating labor costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $4.1 million increase in labor costs was due to additional staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility and its operations. Depreciation, depletion and accretion included in cost of goods sold account for $7.3 million and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $36.9 million and $32.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased sales volumes and higher reservation revenue as compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher cost of goods sold and lower shortfall revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $18.2 million and $12.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Operating expenses are primarily comprised of wages and benefits, professional services fees and other administrative expenses. Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes were $8.2 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The approximate $0.8 million increase was primarily due to additional employee headcount and stock compensation grants in 2017 compared to 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $5.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of additional insurance, consulting and legal costs incurred as a publicly traded corporation as well as increased development activity.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest on the Series A Preferred Stock accounted for $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The paid-in-kind interest was added to the outstanding balance of the Preferred Stock. On November 9, 2016, the Series A Preferred Stock was fully redeemed and our former revolving credit facility was paid in full and terminated using a portion of the proceeds from IPO. We incurred $0.5 million and $2.9 million of interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest expense in 2017 was derived primarily from deferred finance fees and unused line fees for our Credit Facility. Interest expense in 2016 was derived primarily from interest on our former revolving credit facility. Additional items included in interest expense included the accretion of common stock issued and transaction costs incurred in conjunction with the September 2011 Securities Purchase Agreement, deferred financing fees, and interest incurred on capital leases. No borrowings were drawn against our Credit Facility in 2017. Other income was $0.5 million and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017, we recognized other income of approximately $1.9 million related to the settlement of our unsecured bankruptcy claim with a former customer and $6.6 million related to the sale of our unsecured bankruptcy claim with the same customer.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax benefit was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to income tax expense of $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our statutory tax rate and effective tax rate were approximately 35.0% and (15.0)%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our statutory tax rate and effective tax rate were approximately 35.0% and 48.0%, respectively. The difference in these tax rates for both 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to state income tax, non-deductible interest expense on the Preferred Stock costs associated with our initial public offering process. The computation of the 2017 effective tax rate includes modifications for share-based compensation, domestic manufacturing deduction, and state income tax credit among others. The computation for 2017 included the impact of depletion method change for tax purposes on our prior year returns. The effective rate was also impacted by tax reform signed into law in 2017, as indicated below. The computation for 2016 also included modifications for non-deductible interest expense on the Series A Preferred Stock. The primary drivers of the difference between the effective rates in 2017 and 2016 was the full\nredemption of the Series A Preferred Stock in November 2016, the method of calculating depletion for tax purposes and tax reform.\nAs a result of the Tax Reform Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. There are additional provisions in the Tax Reform Act that could impact us that will continue to be monitored as additional guidance is released. The tax benefit represents provisional amounts and our current best estimates.\nNet Income\nNet income was $21.5 million for year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher volumes sold and higher reservation revenue, offset by lower shortfall revenue, increased salaries and employee headcount, and additional costs incurred as a result of being publicly traded corporation. Additionally, net income was positively impacted by lower interest expense due to the full redemption of Series A Preferred Stock in November 2016, no debt outstanding on our Credit Facility and the income tax benefit recognized as a result of the Tax Reform Act.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and contribution margin are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and gross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or contribution margin in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and contribution margin may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as net income, plus: (i) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; (ii) income tax expense (benefit); (iii) interest expense; and (iv) franchise taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus: (i) gain or loss on sale of fixed assets or discontinued operations; (ii) integration and transition costs associated with specified transactions; (iii) equity compensation; (iv) acquisition and development costs; (v) non-recurring cash charges related to restructuring, retention and other similar actions; (vi) earn-out, contingent consideration obligations and other acquisition and development costs; and (vii) non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\n \u2022 the financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets; \n \u2022 the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities\u037e \n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures\u037e \n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without regard to the impact of financing methods or capital structure; and \n \u2022 our debt covenant compliance, as Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of critical covenants to the Credit Facility.  We believe that our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income presented in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization\n</td> <td>18,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>5,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,809\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>2,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise taxes\n</td> <td>442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on sale of fixed assets\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Integration and transition costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial public offering related costs (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity compensation (2)\n</td> <td>2,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and development costs (3)\n</td> <td>(218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash impairment of goodwill and other intangible asset (4)\n</td> <td>17,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash charges related to retention and employee relocation\n</td> <td>674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion of asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) For the year ended December 31, 2016, represents IPO-related bonuses.\n (2) Represents the non-cash expenses for stock-based awards issued to our employees and employee stock purchase plan compensation expense. \n (3) Represents costs incurred related to the business combinations and current development project activities. The year ended December 31, 2018 includes $1,858 decrease in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Quickthree, partially offset by $1,146 of costs related to the acquisition of Quickthree and $494 related to development project activities. The year ended December 31, 2017 includes costs related to development project activities. \n (4) An impairment charge of $17,835 related to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. The impairment charge relates primarily to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet.  _________________________\nAdjusted EBITDA was $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to higher sales volumes, including in-basin sales, and higher average selling prices, partially offset by increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, along with increased transportation charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, resulted from decreased shortfall revenue and increased cost of goods sold due to higher sales volumes and the increased in-basin activities from customer sales with pass-through freight and the additional staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility.\nContribution Margin\nWe also use contribution margin, which we define as total revenues less costs of goods sold excluding depreciation, depletion and accretion of asset retirement obligations, to measure our financial and operating performance. Contribution margin excludes other operating expenses and income, including costs not directly associated with the operations of our business such as accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, sales and other administrative activities.\nHistorically, we have reported production costs and production cost per ton as non-GAAP financial measures. As we expand our logistics activities and continue to sell sand closer to the wellhead, our sand production costs will only be a portion of our overall cost structure.\nWe believe that a transition to reporting contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold will provide a better performance metric to management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, because these metrics provide an operating and financial measure of our ability, as a combined business, to generate margin in excess of our operating cost base. As such, we believe that it is no longer relevant to report production costs or production costs per ton on a standalone basis.\nGross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin. Contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to gross profit presented in accordance with GAAP. Because contribution margin may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of contribution margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of contribution margin to gross profit.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>144,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>67,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, and accretion of asset retirement obligations included in cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>16,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Contribution margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Contribution margin per ton\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total tons sold\n</td> <td>2,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContribution margin was $83.9 million, or $28.00 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $44.2 million, or $18.05 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the increased sales volumes overall as well as increased in-basin sales volumes through our Van Hook terminal, which began operations in April 2018, coupled with favorable pricing trends in the first half of 2018. These positive sales volumes and pricing trends in the first half of 2018 more than compensated for reduced demand and pricing in the second half of 2018.\nContribution margin was $44.2 million, or $18.05 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $38.7 million, or $46.90 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in contribution margin per ton in 2017 was primarily due to significantly increased sales volumes and increased cost of goods sold with the inclusion of pass-through freight from customers with increased in-basin activities and additional staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCurrently, our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. Based on our balance sheet, cash flows, current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity, which includes our Credit Facility and other available capital resources, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including investing in our wellsite proppant storage solutions and other capital projects, while rightsizing our labor and equipment costs. Going forward, we expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nOn November 9, 2016, we consummated the IPO of 11.7 million shares of common stock at a price of $11.00 per share, generating net proceeds to us of $128.7 million before underwriting discounts and expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to redeem all of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our former revolving credit facility, which was terminated. We used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn February 1, 2017, we consummated a follow-on offering and sale of 1.5 million shares of common stock at a price of $17.50 per share, generating net proceeds to us of $24.3 million before underwriting discounts and expenses. We used the proceeds from this offering for capital projects and general corporate services.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is a measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. The following table presents the components of our working capital as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current liabilities\n</td> <td>24,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur working capital was $25.4 million at December 31, 2018 compared to working capital of $38.6 million at December 31, 2017. In 2018 our shortfall revenue increased near year-end, which resulted in increased accounts receivable and unbilled receivables. We also used existing cash on hand and proceeds from our Credit Facility to substantially complete the Oakdale expansion and to acquire Quickthree and the assets at the Van Hook terminal. In 2017, we closed on an equity offering of 1.5 million shares of our common stock, generating net proceeds of approximately $24.2 million.\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations and capital projects for at least the next twelve months.\nLiquidity\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(125,989\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(51,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $50.9 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Operating cash flows include net income of $18.7 million and $21.5 million in net earnings generated from the sale of frac sand to our customers in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, partially offset by higher cost of production, general and administrative expenses and interest, adjusted for changes in working capital.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.6 million and $26.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Operating cash flows include net income of $21.5 million and $10.4 million in net earnings generated from the sale of frac sand to our customers in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, partially offset by higher cost of production, general and administrative expenses and cash interest expense, adjusted for changes in working capital.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $126.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $74.9 million increase was primarily the result of our acquisitions of the Van Hook terminal, Quickthree, and capital expenditures related to the completion of the Oakdale expansion project which began in 2017.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $48.6 million increase was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures related primarily to the expansion of our processing facilities in Oakdale, Wisconsin.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily related to net draws on our Credit Facility of $44.5 million partially offset by repurchases of our common shares of $2.2 million and repayments of notes payable of $0.6 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included net proceeds from equity issuance of $24.2 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included net proceeds from equity issuance of $127.3 million, offset by net repayments of $64.2 million under our former revolving credit facility and $40.3 million of Series A Preferred Stock.\nIndebtedness\nCredit Facility\nWe have total borrowing capacity of $60.0 million on our Credit Facility. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral. In February 2019, we entered into an agreement with the existing lenders on our Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility to June 30, 2020 and also to reduce the total capacity to $50.0 million by December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had $15.5 million in total undrawn availability under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility contains various reporting requirements, negative covenants and restrictive provisions and requires maintenance of financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio (each as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nNotes Payable\nWe have entered into various financing arrangements to support the manufacturing of our wellsite proppant storage solutions equipment with interest rates between 6.48% and 7.49%. Title to the equipment is held by the financial institutions as collateral, though the equipment is included in the Company's property plant and equipment.\nCapital Leases\nWe have entered into various financing arrangements to finance equipment used in the operations of our business with interest rates between 6.80% - 7.10%. Equipment with a cost of $657 and $1,484 has been capitalized and included in the Company's property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCapital Requirements\nThe Company estimates that full year 2019 capital expenditures will be approximately $30 million to $40 million, excluding any additional acquisitions.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases at prevailing market prices or through privately negotiated transactions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. On November 8, 2018, the Company announced that the board of directors had approved the Company to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock during the twelve-month period following the announcement of the share repurchase program. At December 31, 2018, the maximum number of shares that the Company may repurchase under the current repurchase authority was 1,411,800 shares.\nThe following table presents specified information about the Company's repurchases of ordinary shares for the year ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>588,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average price per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate repurchase cost (including broker costs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ 2.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe program allows the Company to repurchase shares at its discretion. Market conditions, price, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, and other economic conditions will influence the timing of the repurchase and the number of shares repurchased, if any. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements, may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had $8.6 million of outstanding performance bonds at each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable\n</td> <td>3,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>13,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment, railcar and office leases\n</td> <td>38,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land lease obligations\n</td> <td>42,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Facility\n</td> <td>44,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, environmental contamination and reclamation and the protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact the production levels at our wet processing plant. While our dry plants are able to process finished product volumes evenly throughout the year, our excavation and our wet sand processing activities have historically been limited to primarily non-winter months. As a consequence, we have experienced lower cash operating costs in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year, and higher cash operating costs in the second and third quarter of each calendar year when we overproduced to meet demand in the winter months. These higher cash operating costs were capitalized into inventory and expensed when these tons are sold, which can lead to us having higher overall cost of production in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year as we expense inventory costs that were previously capitalized. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we finished construction of a new wet plant, which is an indoor facility that allows us to produce wet sand inventory year-round to support a portion of our dry sand processing capacity, which may reduce certain of the effects of this seasonality. We may also sell raw frac sand for use in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, our sales volumes to those areas may be reduced during such severe weather periods.\nCustomer Concentration\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to Liberty, EQT, WPX Energy, and Hess accounted for 22.8%, 21.4%, 11.6%, and 10.6%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to Rice Energy, Liberty, Weatherford, and U.S. Well Services accounted for 27.1%, 20.6%, 13.7%, and 10.2%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to EOG Resources, Weatherford, US Well Services, and C&J Energy Services accounted for 37.5%, 25.2%, 22.4%, and 10.8%, respectively, of total revenue.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally acceptable in the United States of\nAmerica. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nListed below are the accounting policies we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved, and that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and all the related amendments to ASC 606 in relation to all contracts that were not completed or expired as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. There was no adjustment made to the opening balance of retained earnings as a result of applying ASC 606. Results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while the comparative information is not restated and will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, the amount of which reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured, and the risk of loss is transferred to the customer.\nUnder current and former revenue standards, this generally means that sales are FCA, payment made at the origination point at our facility, and title passes as the product is loaded into railcars hired by the customer or provided by us. Deliveries of in-basin sand have shipping terms of FCA or DAT, payment made at the destination; and we recognize this revenue when the sand is received at the destination.\nWe derive our revenue by mining and processing sand that our customers purchase for various uses. Our revenues are primarily a function of the price per ton realized and the volumes sold. In some instances, our revenues also include transportation costs we charge to our customers, a monthly charge to reserve sand capacity and shortfall payments due from customers for minimum volume commitments. Our transportation revenue fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the volume of product we transport and the distance between our plant and our customers. Our reservation and shortfall revenue fluctuates based on negotiated contract terms.\nWe sell a limited amount of product under short-term price agreements or at prevailing market rates. The majority of our revenues are realized through long-term take-or-pay contracts. The expiration dates of these contracts range from 2019 through 2022. These agreements define, among other commitments, the volume of product that our customers must purchase, the volume of product that we must provide and the price that we will charge and that our customers will pay for each ton of contracted product. Prices under these agreements are generally indexed to WTI and subject to upward or downward adjustment, based upon: (i) annual percentage price increases; or (ii) market factor increases, including a natural gas surcharge/reduction and a propane surcharge/reduction which are applied if the Average Natural Gas Price or the Average Quarterly Mont Belvieu TX Propane Spot Price, respectively, as listed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, are above the benchmark set in the contract for the preceding calendar quarter. As a result, our realized prices may not grow at rates consistent with broader industry pricing. For example, during periods of rapid price growth, our realized prices may grow more slowly than those of competitors, and during periods of price decline, our realized prices may outperform industry averages. With respect to the take-or-pay arrangements, if the customer is not allowed to make up deficiencies, we recognize revenues to the extent of the minimum contracted quantity, assuming payment is reasonably assured, based on negotiated contract terms and when rights of use are expired, which is generally either quarterly or at the end of a customer contract year rather than ratably over the respective contract year. If deficiencies can be made up, receipts in excess of actual sales are recognized as deferred revenues until production is actually taken or the right to make up deficiencies expires.\nAccounts and Unbilled Receivables\nAccounts receivable represents customer transactions that have been invoiced as of the balance sheet date; unbilled receivables represent customer transactions that have not yet been invoiced as of the balance sheet date. Accounts receivable are due within 30 days, or in accordance with terms agreed upon with customers, and are stated at amounts due from customers net of any allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms past due. We determine the allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, previous loss history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation, and the condition of the general economy and the\nindustry as a whole. Accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to bad debt expense. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $42 and $0, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the portion of unbilled receivables included in deferred revenue was $578 and $0, respectively.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nWe estimate the future cost of dismantling, restoring and reclaiming operating excavation sites and related facilities in accordance with federal, state and local regulatory requirements and recognize reclamation obligations when extraction occurs and record them as liabilities at estimated fair value. In addition, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset is recorded and depreciated over such asset's useful life or the estimated number of years of extraction. The reclamation liability is accreted to expense over the estimated productive life of the related asset and is subject to adjustments to reflect changes in value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines or mining areas are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for more or less than the carrying amount of the liability, a loss or gain will be recognized, respectively.\nInventory Valuation\nSand inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. Costs applied to inventory include direct excavation costs, processing costs, overhead allocation, depreciation and depletion. Stockpile tonnages are calculated by measuring the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile. Tonnages are verified periodically by an independent surveyor. Costs are calculated on a per ton basis and are applied to the stockpiles based on the number of tons in the stockpile.\nSpare parts inventory includes critical spare parts. We account for spare parts on a first in first out basis, and value the inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nDepletion\nWe amortize the cost to acquire land and mineral rights using a units-of-production method, based on the total estimated reserves and tonnage extracted each period.\nImpairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets\nIn applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the remainder recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of December 31, and whenever indicators of impairment arise. The fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of December 31, and whenever indicators of impairment arise.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of its goodwill and the estimated fair value of the Company was in excess of its carrying value. To perform the test, we used valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of the Company as a single reporting unit under the income and market approaches. Under the discounted cash flow method, an income approach, the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debt-free after-tax cash flows for a finite period of years. Key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management, business risk, and expected rates of return on capital. The guideline company method, a market approach, develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies. Key estimates and selection of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies, obtaining estimates of forecast revenues and EBITDA estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics. Under the similar transactions method, a market approach, actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units is used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the Company. Following the fair value determination using the methods above, we conducted an evaluation of our stock price at or near the measurement date and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the fair value of the Company.\nWe periodically evaluate whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate future undiscounted net cash (without interest charges), estimated future sales prices (considering historical and current prices, price trends and related factors) and anticipated operating costs and capital expenditures. If the carrying value of our long-lived assets is less than the undiscounted cash flows, the assets are measured at fair value and an impairment is recorded if that fair value is less than the carrying value.\nOur estimates of prices, recoverable proven reserves and operating and capital costs are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of our long-lived assets. Although we have made our best estimate of these factors based on current conditions, it is reasonably possible that changes could occur, which could adversely affect our estimate of the net cash flows expected to be generated from our operating property. There were no impairment charges of our long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. We recorded an impairment charge of $17.8 million related to goodwill and an other indefinite-lived intangible asset for the year ended December 31, 2018. The impairment charge relates primarily to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet. We did not have goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2017 or 2016. There were no impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nUnder the balance sheet approach to provide for income taxes, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. If we determine it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the benefits of the deductible temporary differences, we record a valuation against the net deferred tax asset.\nWe recognize the impact of uncertain tax positions at the largest amount that, in our judgment, is more-likely-than-not to be required to be recognized upon examination by a taxing authority.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is recorded based upon the fair value of the award at grant date. Such costs are recognized as expense over the corresponding requisite service period. The fair value of the awards granted was calculated based on a weighted analysis of (i) publicly-traded companies in a similar line of business to us (market comparable method) and (ii) our discounted cash flows. The application of this valuation model involves inputs and assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the valuation of incentive awards, which affects compensation expense related to these awards. These inputs and assumptions include the value of a share of our common stock.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we used a combination of the guideline company approach and a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our stock. The key assumptions in this estimate included our projections of future cash flows, company-specific cost of capital used as a discount rate, lack of marketability discount, and qualitative factors to compare us to comparable guideline companies. During 2016, factors that contributed to changes in the underlying value of our stock included the continued market challenges and corresponding decline in oil and natural gas drilling activity, changes to future cash flows projected from the expansion of capacity, product mix, including mix of finer grade versus coarser grade sand, and other factors. As our operations are highly dependent on sales to the oil and natural gas industry, the market conditions for this industry had a high degree of impact on the company's value.\nOnce our shares became publicly traded, we began using the actual market price of our shares or an adjusted price using a Monte Carlo simulation for awards subject to the Company's performance as compared to a defined peer group as the grant date fair value for restricted stock awards.\nThe following is a summary of the restricted stock awards granted and the related grant date fair value in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nShares Granted\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the year ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company\u201d pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012. Section 102 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our election to opt-out\u201d of the extended transition period is irrevocable.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2017, the FASB issues ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which simplifies the test for goodwill impairment. To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the Board eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company adopted this standard on October 1, 2018 and has applied the new accounting standard to its annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2018.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which replaces the existing guidance in ASC 840, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities with corresponding right of use assets. The new lease standard does not substantially change lessor accounting. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company intends to adopt ASU 2016-02 and its related updates using the transition practical expedients, which allows the Company to use the existing lease population, classification and determination of initial direct costs when calculating the lease liability and right of use asset balances. The Company also intends to use the optional transition method, which allows the Company to initially apply the new standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company has implemented new accounting policies and software to facilitate the recording and reporting of lease transactions and balances. The Company will record initial right of use assets and related liabilities of approximately $36 million on its consolidated balance sheet on January 1, 2019. Significant new disclosures in the notes to the financial statements will be added in the first quarterly report of 2019. The Company does not expect there to be a material impact on the other consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Item 6, Selected Financial Data,\u201d Item 1, Business,\u201d and the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Item 1, Business-Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this report. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nFactors Impacting Comparability of Our Financial Results\nOur historical results of operations and cash flows are not indicative of results of operations and cash flows to be expected in the future, principally for the following reasons:\n \u2022 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible asset. In 2018 we recorded an impairment of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset in the amount of $17.8 million, which was recorded as an operating expense on the consolidated income statement. The impairment charge reduced our earnings per share by $0.44 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018. See our discussion in the GAAP Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017: Operating Expenses\u201d for additional information regarding this transaction. \n \u2022 Expansion of our Oakdale facility. In May 2018, we completed an expansion project to increase our nameplate processing capacity at our Oakdale facility from 3.3 million tons per year to 5.5 million tons per year. \n \u2022 We have increased our deliveries of sand to the basins. In 2018, a greater portion of the raw frac sand that we sold was delivered directly to the basins. This results in higher average selling prices along with additional costs related to such delivery. \n \u2022 Market Trends. Demand for proppants through the first half of 2016 decreased due to the downturn in commodity prices originating in late 2014 and the corresponding reduction in oil and natural gas drilling, completion and production activity. The change in demand during this period impacted contract discussions and negotiated terms with our customers as existing contracts were adjusted, resulting in a combination of reduced average selling prices per ton, and adjustments to take-or-pay volumes and lengths of contracts. During the market downturn, customers began to purchase more volumes on a spot basis as compared to committing to long-term contracts, and this trend continued until oil and natural gas drilling and completion activity began to increase beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. From early 2017 through the second quarter of 2018, improvements in oil and natural gas prices created a more stable market environment. During the second half of 2018, the demand for Northern White sand decreased, which we believe was due primarily to insufficient takeaway capacity for the incremental oil and natural gas production coming online in the Permian Basin, along with increased availability of regional sand as a source of proppant in the Permian basin. Additionally, oil and natural gas companies reduced their spending in the latter portion of the year due to strong spending in the first half of 2018 and lower oil prices, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our spot sales continued at decreased rates through the second half of 2018, and we have agreed to temporary price adjustments under certain of our long-term agreements. In general, we have received a term extension in exchange for such price adjustments. Otherwise, the contractual terms under our long-term agreements have not changed materially. In general, customers under long-term take or pay contracts are required to make periodic shortfall payments, which we recognize as revenue in our results of operations in the period in which the obligation becomes due. Contracted volumes have decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting in additional shortfall revenue. \nOverview\nWe are a fully integrated frac sand supply and services company, offering complete mine to wellsite solutions for our customers. We produce low-cost, high quality Northern White raw frac sand, which is a premium proppant used to enhance hydrocarbon recovery rates in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. We also offer proppant logistics solutions to our customers through our in-basin transloading terminal and wellsite storage capabilities. We currently market our products and services primarily to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and oilfield service companies and sell our\nproducts under a combination of long-term take-or-pay contracts and spot sales in the open market. We believe that the size and favorable geologic characteristics of our sand reserves, the strategic location and logistical advantages of our facilities, our proprietary portable wellsite storage solutions and the industry experience of our senior management team have positioned us as a highly attractive provider of raw frac sand and proppant logistics services from the mine to the wellsite.\nWe own and operate a raw frac sand mine and related processing facility near Oakdale, Wisconsin, at which we have approximately 317 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves as of December 31, 2018. We incorporated in Delaware in July 2011 and began operations with 1.1 million tons of annual nameplate processing capacity in July 2012. After several expansions, our current annual nameplate processing capacity at our Oakdale facility is approximately 5.5 million tons of raw frac sand per year. Our integrated Oakdale facility, with onsite rail infrastructure and wet and dry sand processing facilities, has access to two Class I rail lines, which enables us to process and cost effectively deliver products to our customers.\nRecent Developments\nWellsite Storage Solutions\nOn June 1, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Quickthree Solutions, Inc. ( Quickthree\u201d), a manufacturer of portable vertical proppant storage solution systems. The consideration for the transaction consisted of approximately $30.0 million in cash, which was paid at closing using cash on hand and advances under the Credit Facility, and up to $12.8 million in potential earn-out payments, which are to be paid as system components are built and made available for sale or lease over the three-year period from the acquisition date. We believe that this acquisition provides us the technology, production capacity and management team to compete further in the proppant logistics market and will provide us with an opportunity to expand our customer base by being able to offer proppant logistics services all the way to the wellsite.\nVan Hook Transload Terminal\nOn March 15, 2018, we acquired the rights to operate a multi-unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota to service the Bakken Formation, in the Williston Basin. We paid consideration of approximately $15.5 million to acquire certain assets at the Van Hook terminal, and entered into a long-term lease agreement in connection with the transaction. As part of this transaction, we entered into a long-term agreement with Canadian Pacific Railway to service the Van Hook terminal directly along with the other key oil and natural gas exploration and production basins of North America. The Van Hook terminal became operational in April 2018. Since operations have commenced, we have been providing Northern White sand in-basin at this terminal to our customers. We believe this new terminal provides us with an opportunity to expand our customer base and offer more efficient delivery options to customers operating in the Williston Basin.\nAssets and Operations\nOakdale\nOur sand reserves include a balanced concentration of coarse sand, (19% 20/40 and coarser), finer sand (41% of 40/70 mesh) and fine sand (40% 60/140 gradation, which we refer to in this annual report as 100 mesh\u201d). Our 30/50 gradation is a derivative of the 20/40 and 40/70 blends. We believe that this mix of coarse and fine sand reserves, combined with contractual demand for our products across a range of mesh sizes, provides us with relatively higher mining yields and lower processing costs than frac sand mines with predominantly coarse sand reserves. In addition, our approximate 317 million tons of proven recoverable reserves implies a reserve life of approximately 58 years based on our current annual nameplate processing capacity of 5.5 million tons. This long reserve life enables us to better serve demand for different types of raw frac sand as compared to mines with shorter reserve lives.\nOur Oakdale facility is purpose-built to exploit the reserve profile in place and produce high-quality raw frac sand. Unlike some of our competitors, our primary processing and rail loading facilities are located in close proximity to the mine site, which limits the need for us to truck sand on public roads between the mine and the production facility or between wet and dry processing facilities. Our on-site transportation assets include approximately nine miles of rail track in a triple-loop configuration and four railcar loading facilities that are connected to a Class I rail line owned by Canadian Pacific. This enables us to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains and significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers' raw frac sand transportation needs. With the addition of our unit train capable transload facility approximately three miles from the Oakdale facility in Byron Township, Wisconsin, we also have the ability to ship sand to our customers on the Union Pacific network. We believe that we are the only sand facility in Wisconsin that has dual served rail capabilities, which should create competition among our rail carriers and allow us to provide more competitive logistics options for our customers.\nDue to sustained freezing temperatures in our area of operation during winter months, we have historically halted the operation of our wet plant for approximately three to five months. As a result, we have excavated and washed sand in excess of\ncurrent delivery requirements during the months when the wet plant was operational. This excess sand is placed in stockpiles that feed the dry plants and enable us to fill customer orders throughout the year without interruption. Our second wet plant facility, brought online in the fourth quarter of 2017, is enclosed, which allows us to operate at full capacity during the winter months.\nLogistics\nThrough our acquisitions of the transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota and a manufacturer of portable vertical frac sand storage systems, we have expanded our logistics capabilities. We now provide Northern White sand in-basin to customers operating in the Williston Basin and we have the technology, production capacity and management team to compete further in the raw frac sand supply chain for our customers by offering logistics services all the way to the wellsite.\nWe intend to continue expanding our footprint in-basin through the addition of one or more terminals in other oil and natural gas operating basins while expanding our wellsite storage solutions fleets. Benefits of our long-term growth strategy for in-basin delivery of sand include new contracted customers by marketing through our own terminal, more opportunity for spot sales by forward deploying sand and the opportunity to capture incremental margin on the sale of sand farther down the supply chain by managing the cost of rail and terminal operations. Additionally, having a presence in-basin gives us an opportunity to have a base of operations from which to market our wellsite solutions. We believe our key differentiators in our wellsite storage solutions are:\n i. our portable silos can be set up or taken down rapidly; \n ii. our trailers detach, which reduces their footprint; \n iii. our storage silos include industry-leading passive and active dust suppression technology; and \n iv. our patented system is the only one of its kind that has the capability of a gravity-fed operation and when used in combination with our Quickload system, our silos can be filled by both pneumatic and gravity dump trailers.  Through the expansion of our wellsite storage solutions fleet and the addition of one or more terminals, we continue evaluating ways to reduce the landed cost of our products in-basin and to the wellsite for our customers while increasing our customized service offerings to provide our customers with additional delivery and pricing alternatives, including selling product on an as-delivered\u201d basis to the wellsite.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nWe generate revenue by excavating and processing frac sand, which we sell to our customers under long-term price agreements or as spot sales at prevailing market rates. In some instances, revenues also include a charge for transportation services provided to customers. Our transportation revenue fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the volume of product transported and the distance between the plant and our customers.\nWe have entered into long-term take-or-pay contracts with customers that are intended to mitigate our exposure to the potential price volatility of the spot market for raw frac sand and to enhance the stability of our cash flows. Our contracts contain a minimum volume purchase requirement and provides for delivery of raw frac sand FCA at our Oakdale facility, our Van Hook transloading terminal in the Bakken, or another location specified by our customers. As of March 1, 2019, we have approximately 58.7% of our current annual nameplate production capacity contracted under eight long-term take-or-pay contracts with a weighted average life of approximately two years.\nRevenue is generally recognized FCA, payment made at the origination point at our facility, and title passes as the product is loaded into railcars hired by the customer or provided by us. Certain contracted and spot-rate customers have shipping terms of FCA, DAT or DAP, payment made at the destination, for which we recognize revenue when the sand is delivered.\nCosts of Conducting Our Business\nThe principal direct costs involved in operating our business are labor, maintenance, utility costs, equipment and excavation. We incur labor costs associated with employees at our processing facility represent the most significant cost of converting raw frac sand to finished product. Our Oakdale facility undergoes maintenance to minimize unscheduled downtime and ensure the ongoing quality of our raw frac sand. We incur utility costs in connection with the operation of our processing facility, primarily electricity and natural gas, which are both susceptible to market fluctuations. We lease equipment in many areas of our operations including our plants, mining equipment and logistics services. Excavation costs with respect to the excavation of sand and other materials from which we ultimately do not derive revenue. However, the ratio of rejected\nmaterials to total amounts excavated has been, and we believe will continue to be, in line with our expectations, given the extensive core sampling and other testing we undertook at the Oakdale facility. In addition, other costs include processing costs, overhead allocation, depreciation and depletion are capitalized as a component of inventory and are reflected in cost of goods sold when inventory is sold.\nOverall Trends and Outlook\nDemand Trends\nAccording to Spears, the North American proppant market, including raw frac sand, ceramic and resin-coated proppant, was approximately 98 million tons in 2018, which is a 33% increase over the 74 million tons Spears reported for 2017. Spears estimates that 2019 demand will increase 4% and 2020 demand will increase another 14%, representing an increase of approximately 25 million tons in proppant demand over the next two years.\n\nDemand growth for raw frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by advancements in oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. These advancements have made the extraction of oil and natural gas increasingly cost-effective in formations that historically would have been uneconomic to develop. More proppant is being used per well, which is driving the increase in proppant demand despite horizontal drilling activity stabilizing. Spears estimates that proppant demand will reach approximately 101 million tons in 2019 and 120 million tons in 2020. Spears also estimates that average proppant usage per well was approximately 5,800 tons per well in 2018 and will rise to approximately 7,400 tons per well by the end of 2020.\nSupply Trends\nIn 2018, significant capacity was added in numerous regions. The total mine capacity outpaced customer demand for raw frac sand leading to an over supplied market which has put pricing pressure on high-quality raw frac sand. Several factors contributing to this supply surplus include over-development of new sand mines in response to the prior year shortage, an increase in the usage of local sand, and logistical challenges on delivering sand in the higher quantities required by the new higher proppant intensity wells.\nSupplies of high-quality Northern White raw frac sand are limited to select areas, predominantly in western Wisconsin and limited areas of Minnesota and Illinois. The ability to obtain large contiguous reserves in these areas is a key constraint and can be an important supply consideration when assessing the economic viability of a potential raw frac sand facility. Further constraining the supply and throughput of Northern White raw frac sand is that not all of the large reserve mines have onsite excavation and processing capability. Historically, much of the capital investment in Northern White raw frac sand mines was\nused to develop coarser deposits in western Wisconsin. As such, we've seen competitors in the Northern White frac sand market reduce their capacity by shuttering or idling operations as the shift to finer sands in the liquid and oil plays erodes the ongoing economic viability of producing finer grades of sand.\nManagement's Outlook\nWe generally expect the price of raw frac sand to correlate with the level of drilling activity for oil and natural gas, although the increasing supply of sand could keep the price depressed. The willingness of exploration and production companies to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of oil and natural gas, the cost to drill, complete and operate a well, the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations, as well as their ability to acquire the sand at the wellsite. We generally expect the level of drilling to correlate with long-term trends in commodity prices. Similarly, oil and natural gas production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to correlate with drilling activity.\nOur sand is sold on a contract basis or through spot market pricing. Our long-term take-or-pay contracts reduce exposure to fluctuations in price and provide predictability of volumes and price over the contract term. By contrast, the spot market provides us with direct access to immediate prices, offering an outlet to sell excess production at opportunistic times or during favorable market conditions, which also comes with accompanying exposure to price volatility and uncertainty.\nGAAP Results of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017: \nRevenue\nRevenue was $212.5 million ($70.94 per ton) for the year ended December 31, 2018, during which we sold approximately 2,995,000 tons of sand. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $137.2 million ($56.03 per ton), during which we sold approximately 2,449,000 tons of sand. Revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices.\nThe key factors contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 were as follows:\n \u2022 Sand sales revenue increased to $143.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to increased sales volumes and higher average selling prices. Tons sold increased by 22.3% resulting from increased exploration and production activity in the oil and natural gas industry in 2018 compared to 2017. \n \u2022 Average selling price per ton increased to $47.76 for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $32.74 for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to increased volumes and higher average selling prices related to increased in-basin sand sales volumes, which are sold at a higher price than sand sold at the mine gate and favorable price adjustments under certain of our take-or-pay contracts based upon the Average Cushing Oklahoma WTI Spot Prices. \n \u2022 We had $6.0 million in contractual shortfall revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Our customer contracts dictate whether customers are invoiced quarterly or at the end of their respective contract year for shortfall payments. We recognize revenue to the extent of the unfulfilled minimum contracted quantity at the shortfall price per ton as stated in the contract once payment is received or reasonably assured. \n \u2022 Transportation revenue, which includes freight for certain mine gate sand sales and railcar usage, increased approximately $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing from $55.8 million to $62.9 million. The increase in transportation revenue was due to the increased sales volumes in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of increased exploration and production activity in the oil and natural gas industry as well as our increased in-basin sales activity generated from our Van Hook terminal which began operations in April 2018.  Cost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold was $144.9 million and $100.3 million, or $48.38 and $40.96 per ton sold, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cost of goods sold and per ton cost of goods sold increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher sales volumes, which led to increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, and increased freight charges. Freight charges, which consist of transportation costs and railcar rental and storage expense, were $84.4 million and $59.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $24.7 million increase in freight costs was due primarily to increased tons sold and increased in-basin activities. Additionally, we incurred $20.9 million and $9.3 million of operating labor costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $11.6 million increase in labor costs was due primarily to additional contract staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility. Depreciation, depletion and accretion included in cost of goods sold were $16.3 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $67.6 million and $36.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to higher sales volumes, including in-basin and spot sales, and higher average selling prices, partially offset by increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, along with increased transportation charges.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $41.7 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Operating expenses are primarily comprised of wages and benefits, professional services fees and other administrative expenses. An impairment charge of $17.8 related to goodwill and an other indefinite-lived intangible asset was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. The impairment charge relates primarily to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet. Additionally, salaries, benefits and payroll taxes were $11.0 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The approximate $2.8 million increase was primarily due to additional headcount in 2018 as compared to 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of well-site storage solution acquisition-related costs and royalty payments relating to our Texas land leases. We recorded a decrease in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration, which resulted in an offset to operating expenses in the amount of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for our acquisition of Quickthree.\nOther Income (Expense)\nWe incurred $2.3 million and $0.5 million of net interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to borrowings under the Credit Facility to fund acquisition activity. Interest expense in 2017 was derived primarily from deferred finance fees and unused line fees for the Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We recorded a tax benefit of approximately $8.5 million due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the Tax Reform Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our effective tax rate was approximately 21.5% and (15.0)%, respectively, based on the statutory federal rate net of discrete federal and state taxes. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 benefited from the decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35.0% in 2017 to 21.0% in 2018. The computation of the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 included modifications for income tax credits, among other items. The computation for the year ended December 31, 2017 also included a benefit related to share-based compensation and the domestic production activities deduction ( DPAD\u201d). The DPAD was repealed for tax years beginning after January 1, 2018 under the Tax Reform Act. The computation for 2017 also included the impact of depletion method change for tax purposes on our prior year returns.\nThe Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, repealing the deduction for domestic production activities and implementing 100% direct expensing of certain non-residential property. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted.\nFor the year of 2018, we recorded a net operating loss for tax purposes due to the significant amount of capital expenditures, which are eligible for 100% expensing available under the Tax Reform Act. There are additional provisions in the Tax Reform Act that could impact us that will continue to be monitored as additional guidance is released and any necessary adjustments will be recorded in the period that the guidance is released.\nNet Income\nNet income was $18.7 million for year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net income was primarily due to an impairment charge of $17.8 million related to goodwill and an other indefinite-lived intangible asset was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. The impairment charge relates primarily to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet. Increased sales volumes during 2018 and favorable pricing trends in the first half of the year led to higher gross profit which partially offset the impairment charge.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016: \nRevenue\nRevenue was $137.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, during which we sold approximately 2,449,000 tons of sand. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $59.2 million, during which we sold approximately 826,000 tons of sand. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to improved market conditions and higher sales volumes (including spot sales) in 2017, partially offset by lower average selling prices due to reservation revenue being spread over a larger amount of contractual volumes sold in 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe key factors contributing to the increase in revenues and decrease in average revenue per ton for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\n \u2022 Sand sales revenue increased to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Tons sold increased by 196% as exploration and production activity in the oil and natural gas industry improved in 2017 compared to 2016. \n \u2022 Average selling price per ton, which includes reservation charges, decreased to $32.74 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $38.28 for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to increased volumes, which led to reservation charges being allocated to a greater number of tons sold; and \n \u2022 Reservation and contractual shortfall revenues were $30.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Shortfall revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from two customers that were unable to meet the take-or-pay requirements for their respective contract year. Reservation and contractual shortfall revenues were $15.0 million and $20.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Shortfall revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from three customers that were unable to meet the take-or-pay requirements for their respective contract year. Certain customers were required to pay a fixed-price monthly reservation charge based on a minimum contractual volume over the remaining life of their contract, which are then credited against any applicable shortfall payments. With respect to shortfall revenues, our customer contracts dictated whether customers were invoiced quarterly or at the end of their respective contract year for shortfall payments. We recognized revenue to the extent of the unfulfilled minimum contracted quantity at the shortfall price per ton as stated in the contract once payment was received or was reasonably assured. \n \u2022 Transportation revenue, which included railcar rental, was approximately $49.1 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 increasing from $6.7 million to $55.8 million \ndue to higher freight pass-through charges billed to our customers. Railcar rental revenue was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing by approximately $2.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in the number of railcars rented to our customers under long-term contracts.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold was $100.3 million and $26.6 million, or $40.96 and $32.30 per ton sold, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of goods sold and per ton cost of goods sold increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher sales volumes, which led to increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, and increased freight charges. Freight charges, which consist of transportation costs and railcar rental and storage expense, were $59.7 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $50.0 million increase in freight costs was due primarily to increased tons sold and increased in-basin activities and customer sales with pass-through freight. Additionally, we incurred $9.3 million and $5.2 million of operating labor costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $4.1 million increase in labor costs was due to additional staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility and its operations. Depreciation, depletion and accretion included in cost of goods sold account for $7.3 million and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $36.9 million and $32.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased sales volumes and higher reservation revenue as compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher cost of goods sold and lower shortfall revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $18.2 million and $12.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Operating expenses are primarily comprised of wages and benefits, professional services fees and other administrative expenses. Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes were $8.2 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The approximate $0.8 million increase was primarily due to additional employee headcount and stock compensation grants in 2017 compared to 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $5.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of additional insurance, consulting and legal costs incurred as a publicly traded corporation as well as increased development activity.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest on the Series A Preferred Stock accounted for $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The paid-in-kind interest was added to the outstanding balance of the Preferred Stock. On November 9, 2016, the Series A Preferred Stock was fully redeemed and our former revolving credit facility was paid in full and terminated using a portion of the proceeds from IPO. We incurred $0.5 million and $2.9 million of interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest expense in 2017 was derived primarily from deferred finance fees and unused line fees for our Credit Facility. Interest expense in 2016 was derived primarily from interest on our former revolving credit facility. Additional items included in interest expense included the accretion of common stock issued and transaction costs incurred in conjunction with the September 2011 Securities Purchase Agreement, deferred financing fees, and interest incurred on capital leases. No borrowings were drawn against our Credit Facility in 2017. Other income was $0.5 million and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017, we recognized other income of approximately $1.9 million related to the settlement of our unsecured bankruptcy claim with a former customer and $6.6 million related to the sale of our unsecured bankruptcy claim with the same customer.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax benefit was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to income tax expense of $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our statutory tax rate and effective tax rate were approximately 35.0% and (15.0)%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our statutory tax rate and effective tax rate were approximately 35.0% and 48.0%, respectively. The difference in these tax rates for both 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to state income tax, non-deductible interest expense on the Preferred Stock costs associated with our initial public offering process. The computation of the 2017 effective tax rate includes modifications for share-based compensation, domestic manufacturing deduction, and state income tax credit among others. The computation for 2017 included the impact of depletion method change for tax purposes on our prior year returns. The effective rate was also impacted by tax reform signed into law in 2017, as indicated below. The computation for 2016 also included modifications for non-deductible interest expense on the Series A Preferred Stock. The primary drivers of the difference between the effective rates in 2017 and 2016 was the full\nredemption of the Series A Preferred Stock in November 2016, the method of calculating depletion for tax purposes and tax reform.\nAs a result of the Tax Reform Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. There are additional provisions in the Tax Reform Act that could impact us that will continue to be monitored as additional guidance is released. The tax benefit represents provisional amounts and our current best estimates.\nNet Income\nNet income was $21.5 million for year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher volumes sold and higher reservation revenue, offset by lower shortfall revenue, increased salaries and employee headcount, and additional costs incurred as a result of being publicly traded corporation. Additionally, net income was positively impacted by lower interest expense due to the full redemption of Series A Preferred Stock in November 2016, no debt outstanding on our Credit Facility and the income tax benefit recognized as a result of the Tax Reform Act.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and contribution margin are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and gross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or contribution margin in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and contribution margin may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as net income, plus: (i) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; (ii) income tax expense (benefit); (iii) interest expense; and (iv) franchise taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus: (i) gain or loss on sale of fixed assets or discontinued operations; (ii) integration and transition costs associated with specified transactions; (iii) equity compensation; (iv) acquisition and development costs; (v) non-recurring cash charges related to restructuring, retention and other similar actions; (vi) earn-out, contingent consideration obligations and other acquisition and development costs; and (vii) non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\n \u2022 the financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets; \n \u2022 the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities\u037e \n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures\u037e \n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without regard to the impact of financing methods or capital structure; and \n \u2022 our debt covenant compliance, as Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of critical covenants to the Credit Facility.  We believe that our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income presented in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for each of the periods indicated.\n\n(1) For the year ended December 31, 2016, represents IPO-related bonuses.\n (2) Represents the non-cash expenses for stock-based awards issued to our employees and employee stock purchase plan compensation expense. \n (3) Represents costs incurred related to the business combinations and current development project activities. The year ended December 31, 2018 includes $1,858 decrease in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Quickthree, partially offset by $1,146 of costs related to the acquisition of Quickthree and $494 related to development project activities. The year ended December 31, 2017 includes costs related to development project activities. \n (4) An impairment charge of $17,835 related to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. The impairment charge relates primarily to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet.  _________________________\nAdjusted EBITDA was $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to higher sales volumes, including in-basin sales, and higher average selling prices, partially offset by increased staffing, utilities and equipment expenses, along with increased transportation charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, resulted from decreased shortfall revenue and increased cost of goods sold due to higher sales volumes and the increased in-basin activities from customer sales with pass-through freight and the additional staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility.\nContribution Margin\nWe also use contribution margin, which we define as total revenues less costs of goods sold excluding depreciation, depletion and accretion of asset retirement obligations, to measure our financial and operating performance. Contribution margin excludes other operating expenses and income, including costs not directly associated with the operations of our business such as accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, sales and other administrative activities.\nHistorically, we have reported production costs and production cost per ton as non-GAAP financial measures. As we expand our logistics activities and continue to sell sand closer to the wellhead, our sand production costs will only be a portion of our overall cost structure.\nWe believe that a transition to reporting contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold will provide a better performance metric to management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, because these metrics provide an operating and financial measure of our ability, as a combined business, to generate margin in excess of our operating cost base. As such, we believe that it is no longer relevant to report production costs or production costs per ton on a standalone basis.\nGross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin. Contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to gross profit presented in accordance with GAAP. Because contribution margin may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of contribution margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of contribution margin to gross profit.\n\nContribution margin was $83.9 million, or $28.00 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $44.2 million, or $18.05 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the increased sales volumes overall as well as increased in-basin sales volumes through our Van Hook terminal, which began operations in April 2018, coupled with favorable pricing trends in the first half of 2018. These positive sales volumes and pricing trends in the first half of 2018 more than compensated for reduced demand and pricing in the second half of 2018.\nContribution margin was $44.2 million, or $18.05 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $38.7 million, or $46.90 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in contribution margin per ton in 2017 was primarily due to significantly increased sales volumes and increased cost of goods sold with the inclusion of pass-through freight from customers with increased in-basin activities and additional staffing to support the expansion of the Oakdale facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCurrently, our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. Based on our balance sheet, cash flows, current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity, which includes our Credit Facility and other available capital resources, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including investing in our wellsite proppant storage solutions and other capital projects, while rightsizing our labor and equipment costs. Going forward, we expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nOn November 9, 2016, we consummated the IPO of 11.7 million shares of common stock at a price of $11.00 per share, generating net proceeds to us of $128.7 million before underwriting discounts and expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to redeem all of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and to repay the outstanding indebtedness under our former revolving credit facility, which was terminated. We used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn February 1, 2017, we consummated a follow-on offering and sale of 1.5 million shares of common stock at a price of $17.50 per share, generating net proceeds to us of $24.3 million before underwriting discounts and expenses. We used the proceeds from this offering for capital projects and general corporate services.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is a measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. The following table presents the components of our working capital as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017.\n\nOur working capital was $25.4 million at December 31, 2018 compared to working capital of $38.6 million at December 31, 2017. In 2018 our shortfall revenue increased near year-end, which resulted in increased accounts receivable and unbilled receivables. We also used existing cash on hand and proceeds from our Credit Facility to substantially complete the Oakdale expansion and to acquire Quickthree and the assets at the Van Hook terminal. In 2017, we closed on an equity offering of 1.5 million shares of our common stock, generating net proceeds of approximately $24.2 million.\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations and capital projects for at least the next twelve months.\nLiquidity\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $50.9 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Operating cash flows include net income of $18.7 million and $21.5 million in net earnings generated from the sale of frac sand to our customers in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, partially offset by higher cost of production, general and administrative expenses and interest, adjusted for changes in working capital.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.6 million and $26.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Operating cash flows include net income of $21.5 million and $10.4 million in net earnings generated from the sale of frac sand to our customers in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, partially offset by higher cost of production, general and administrative expenses and cash interest expense, adjusted for changes in working capital.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $126.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $74.9 million increase was primarily the result of our acquisitions of the Van Hook terminal, Quickthree, and capital expenditures related to the completion of the Oakdale expansion project which began in 2017.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $48.6 million increase was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures related primarily to the expansion of our processing facilities in Oakdale, Wisconsin.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily related to net draws on our Credit Facility of $44.5 million partially offset by repurchases of our common shares of $2.2 million and repayments of notes payable of $0.6 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included net proceeds from equity issuance of $24.2 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included net proceeds from equity issuance of $127.3 million, offset by net repayments of $64.2 million under our former revolving credit facility and $40.3 million of Series A Preferred Stock.\nIndebtedness\nCredit Facility\nWe have total borrowing capacity of $60.0 million on our Credit Facility. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral. In February 2019, we entered into an agreement with the existing lenders on our Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility to June 30, 2020 and also to reduce the total capacity to $50.0 million by December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had $15.5 million in total undrawn availability under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility contains various reporting requirements, negative covenants and restrictive provisions and requires maintenance of financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio (each as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nNotes Payable\nWe have entered into various financing arrangements to support the manufacturing of our wellsite proppant storage solutions equipment with interest rates between 6.48% and 7.49%. Title to the equipment is held by the financial institutions as collateral, though the equipment is included in the Company's property plant and equipment.\nCapital Leases\nWe have entered into various financing arrangements to finance equipment used in the operations of our business with interest rates between 6.80% - 7.10%. Equipment with a cost of $657 and $1,484 has been capitalized and included in the Company's property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCapital Requirements\nThe Company estimates that full year 2019 capital expenditures will be approximately $30 million to $40 million, excluding any additional acquisitions.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases at prevailing market prices or through privately negotiated transactions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. On November 8, 2018, the Company announced that the board of directors had approved the Company to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock during the twelve-month period following the announcement of the share repurchase program. At December 31, 2018, the maximum number of shares that the Company may repurchase under the current repurchase authority was 1,411,800 shares.\nThe following table presents specified information about the Company's repurchases of ordinary shares for the year ended December 31, 2018:\n\nThe program allows the Company to repurchase shares at its discretion. Market conditions, price, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, and other economic conditions will influence the timing of the repurchase and the number of shares repurchased, if any. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements, may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had $8.6 million of outstanding performance bonds at each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\n\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, environmental contamination and reclamation and the protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact the production levels at our wet processing plant. While our dry plants are able to process finished product volumes evenly throughout the year, our excavation and our wet sand processing activities have historically been limited to primarily non-winter months. As a consequence, we have experienced lower cash operating costs in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year, and higher cash operating costs in the second and third quarter of each calendar year when we overproduced to meet demand in the winter months. These higher cash operating costs were capitalized into inventory and expensed when these tons are sold, which can lead to us having higher overall cost of production in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year as we expense inventory costs that were previously capitalized. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we finished construction of a new wet plant, which is an indoor facility that allows us to produce wet sand inventory year-round to support a portion of our dry sand processing capacity, which may reduce certain of the effects of this seasonality. We may also sell raw frac sand for use in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, our sales volumes to those areas may be reduced during such severe weather periods.\nCustomer Concentration\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to Liberty, EQT, WPX Energy, and Hess accounted for 22.8%, 21.4%, 11.6%, and 10.6%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to Rice Energy, Liberty, Weatherford, and U.S. Well Services accounted for 27.1%, 20.6%, 13.7%, and 10.2%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to EOG Resources, Weatherford, US Well Services, and C&J Energy Services accounted for 37.5%, 25.2%, 22.4%, and 10.8%, respectively, of total revenue.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally acceptable in the United States of\nAmerica. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nListed below are the accounting policies we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved, and that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and all the related amendments to ASC 606 in relation to all contracts that were not completed or expired as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. There was no adjustment made to the opening balance of retained earnings as a result of applying ASC 606. Results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while the comparative information is not restated and will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, the amount of which reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured, and the risk of loss is transferred to the customer.\nUnder current and former revenue standards, this generally means that sales are FCA, payment made at the origination point at our facility, and title passes as the product is loaded into railcars hired by the customer or provided by us. Deliveries of in-basin sand have shipping terms of FCA or DAT, payment made at the destination; and we recognize this revenue when the sand is received at the destination.\nWe derive our revenue by mining and processing sand that our customers purchase for various uses. Our revenues are primarily a function of the price per ton realized and the volumes sold. In some instances, our revenues also include transportation costs we charge to our customers, a monthly charge to reserve sand capacity and shortfall payments due from customers for minimum volume commitments. Our transportation revenue fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the volume of product we transport and the distance between our plant and our customers. Our reservation and shortfall revenue fluctuates based on negotiated contract terms.\nWe sell a limited amount of product under short-term price agreements or at prevailing market rates. The majority of our revenues are realized through long-term take-or-pay contracts. The expiration dates of these contracts range from 2019 through 2022. These agreements define, among other commitments, the volume of product that our customers must purchase, the volume of product that we must provide and the price that we will charge and that our customers will pay for each ton of contracted product. Prices under these agreements are generally indexed to WTI and subject to upward or downward adjustment, based upon: (i) annual percentage price increases; or (ii) market factor increases, including a natural gas surcharge/reduction and a propane surcharge/reduction which are applied if the Average Natural Gas Price or the Average Quarterly Mont Belvieu TX Propane Spot Price, respectively, as listed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, are above the benchmark set in the contract for the preceding calendar quarter. As a result, our realized prices may not grow at rates consistent with broader industry pricing. For example, during periods of rapid price growth, our realized prices may grow more slowly than those of competitors, and during periods of price decline, our realized prices may outperform industry averages. With respect to the take-or-pay arrangements, if the customer is not allowed to make up deficiencies, we recognize revenues to the extent of the minimum contracted quantity, assuming payment is reasonably assured, based on negotiated contract terms and when rights of use are expired, which is generally either quarterly or at the end of a customer contract year rather than ratably over the respective contract year. If deficiencies can be made up, receipts in excess of actual sales are recognized as deferred revenues until production is actually taken or the right to make up deficiencies expires.\nAccounts and Unbilled Receivables\nAccounts receivable represents customer transactions that have been invoiced as of the balance sheet date; unbilled receivables represent customer transactions that have not yet been invoiced as of the balance sheet date. Accounts receivable are due within 30 days, or in accordance with terms agreed upon with customers, and are stated at amounts due from customers net of any allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms past due. We determine the allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, previous loss history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation, and the condition of the general economy and the\nindustry as a whole. Accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to bad debt expense. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $42 and $0, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the portion of unbilled receivables included in deferred revenue was $578 and $0, respectively.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nWe estimate the future cost of dismantling, restoring and reclaiming operating excavation sites and related facilities in accordance with federal, state and local regulatory requirements and recognize reclamation obligations when extraction occurs and record them as liabilities at estimated fair value. In addition, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset is recorded and depreciated over such asset's useful life or the estimated number of years of extraction. The reclamation liability is accreted to expense over the estimated productive life of the related asset and is subject to adjustments to reflect changes in value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines or mining areas are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for more or less than the carrying amount of the liability, a loss or gain will be recognized, respectively.\nInventory Valuation\nSand inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. Costs applied to inventory include direct excavation costs, processing costs, overhead allocation, depreciation and depletion. Stockpile tonnages are calculated by measuring the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile. Tonnages are verified periodically by an independent surveyor. Costs are calculated on a per ton basis and are applied to the stockpiles based on the number of tons in the stockpile.\nSpare parts inventory includes critical spare parts. We account for spare parts on a first in first out basis, and value the inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nDepletion\nWe amortize the cost to acquire land and mineral rights using a units-of-production method, based on the total estimated reserves and tonnage extracted each period.\nImpairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets\nIn applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the remainder recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of December 31, and whenever indicators of impairment arise. The fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of December 31, and whenever indicators of impairment arise.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we performed both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of its goodwill and the estimated fair value of the Company was in excess of its carrying value. To perform the test, we used valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of the Company as a single reporting unit under the income and market approaches. Under the discounted cash flow method, an income approach, the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debt-free after-tax cash flows for a finite period of years. Key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management, business risk, and expected rates of return on capital. The guideline company method, a market approach, develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies. Key estimates and selection of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies, obtaining estimates of forecast revenues and EBITDA estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics. Under the similar transactions method, a market approach, actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units is used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the Company. Following the fair value determination using the methods above, we conducted an evaluation of our stock price at or near the measurement date and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the fair value of the Company.\nWe periodically evaluate whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate future undiscounted net cash (without interest charges), estimated future sales prices (considering historical and current prices, price trends and related factors) and anticipated operating costs and capital expenditures. If the carrying value of our long-lived assets is less than the undiscounted cash flows, the assets are measured at fair value and an impairment is recorded if that fair value is less than the carrying value.\nOur estimates of prices, recoverable proven reserves and operating and capital costs are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of our long-lived assets. Although we have made our best estimate of these factors based on current conditions, it is reasonably possible that changes could occur, which could adversely affect our estimate of the net cash flows expected to be generated from our operating property. There were no impairment charges of our long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. We recorded an impairment charge of $17.8 million related to goodwill and an other indefinite-lived intangible asset for the year ended December 31, 2018. The impairment charge relates primarily to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet. We did not have goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2017 or 2016. There were no impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nUnder the balance sheet approach to provide for income taxes, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. If we determine it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the benefits of the deductible temporary differences, we record a valuation against the net deferred tax asset.\nWe recognize the impact of uncertain tax positions at the largest amount that, in our judgment, is more-likely-than-not to be required to be recognized upon examination by a taxing authority.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is recorded based upon the fair value of the award at grant date. Such costs are recognized as expense over the corresponding requisite service period. The fair value of the awards granted was calculated based on a weighted analysis of (i) publicly-traded companies in a similar line of business to us (market comparable method) and (ii) our discounted cash flows. The application of this valuation model involves inputs and assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the valuation of incentive awards, which affects compensation expense related to these awards. These inputs and assumptions include the value of a share of our common stock.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we used a combination of the guideline company approach and a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our stock. The key assumptions in this estimate included our projections of future cash flows, company-specific cost of capital used as a discount rate, lack of marketability discount, and qualitative factors to compare us to comparable guideline companies. During 2016, factors that contributed to changes in the underlying value of our stock included the continued market challenges and corresponding decline in oil and natural gas drilling activity, changes to future cash flows projected from the expansion of capacity, product mix, including mix of finer grade versus coarser grade sand, and other factors. As our operations are highly dependent on sales to the oil and natural gas industry, the market conditions for this industry had a high degree of impact on the company's value.\nOnce our shares became publicly traded, we began using the actual market price of our shares or an adjusted price using a Monte Carlo simulation for awards subject to the Company's performance as compared to a defined peer group as the grant date fair value for restricted stock awards.\nThe following is a summary of the restricted stock awards granted and the related grant date fair value in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company\u201d pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012. Section 102 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our election to opt-out\u201d of the extended transition period is irrevocable.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2017, the FASB issues ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which simplifies the test for goodwill impairment. To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the Board eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company adopted this standard on October 1, 2018 and has applied the new accounting standard to its annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2018.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which replaces the existing guidance in ASC 840, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities with corresponding right of use assets. The new lease standard does not substantially change lessor accounting. The new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company intends to adopt ASU 2016-02 and its related updates using the transition practical expedients, which allows the Company to use the existing lease population, classification and determination of initial direct costs when calculating the lease liability and right of use asset balances. The Company also intends to use the optional transition method, which allows the Company to initially apply the new standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company has implemented new accounting policies and software to facilitate the recording and reporting of lease transactions and balances. The Company will record initial right of use assets and related liabilities of approximately $36 million on its consolidated balance sheet on January 1, 2019. Significant new disclosures in the notes to the financial statements will be added in the first quarterly report of 2019. The Company does not expect there to be a material impact on the other consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

"The report presents the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for an unnamed company in its Form 10-K Annual Report. Here's a summary:\n\n**Key Factors Impacting Financial Results:**\n- The company recorded an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets amounting to $17.8 million in 2018.\n- Expansion of the Oakdale facility increased processing capacity from 3.3 million tons to 5.5 million tons per year.\n- There was an increase in deliveries of sand directly to the basins, resulting in higher selling prices and additional delivery costs.\n- The demand for proppants decreased in early 2016 but experienced a stable market environment from early 2017 through the second quarter of 2018. In the second half of 2018, demand for Northern White sand dropped primarily due to insufficient takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin and increased availability of regional sand.\n\n**Company Overview:**\n- The company is a fully integrated frac sand supply and services company that offers solutions from mine to wellsite.\n- It produces Northern White raw frac sand and offers proppant logistics solutions.\n- Its Oakdale facility has approximately 317 million tons of proven recoverable reserves.\n- The company began operations in July 2012 with an annual processing capacity of 1.1 million tons, which has since expanded to approximately 5.5 million tons per year.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n- Acquisition of Quickthree Solutions, Inc., a portable vertical proppant storage solution manufacturer.\n- Acquisition of multi-unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota.\n\n**Assets and Operations:**\n- The company owns a mine and processing facility near Oakdale, Wisconsin, with reserves and production facilities allowing for cost-effective delivery of products.\n- Due to cold temperatures, wet plant operations are historically limited during winter months. However, a new facility now operational year-round can mitigate this seasonality effect.\n\n**Logistics:**\n- With the acquisition of a transloading terminal and the manufacturer of portable vertical frac sand storage systems, the company has expanded its logistics capabilities, offering wellsite storage solutions to customers.\n\n**Revenue Generation:**\n- Revenue comes from the sale of excavated and processed frac sand under long-term contracts and spot sales.\n- Price volatility and demand levels are influenced by oil and natural gas drilling activity, commodity prices, and regulatory factors.\n\n**Costs and Operating Expenses:**\n- Expenses include direct labor, utility costs, equipment, excavation, operating expenses, and other general and administrative costs.\n- The company experienced higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices leading to increased gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\n**GAAP Results of Operations:**\n- Revenue and profit analysis shows growth in revenues and profits, though net income decreased due to an impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\n**Seasonality and Customer Concentration:**\n- Operational activities are affected by seasonal weather and primarily rely on a few key customers for a significant portion of revenue.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources:**\n- The company believes it has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its financial obligations for the next twelve months, including capital expenditures of $30 million to $40 million in 2019, excluding acquisitions.\n\n**Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:**\n- The company has capital leases, notes payable, asset retirement obligations, equipment leases, land lease obligations, and a Credit Facility requiring future payments.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies:**\n- Key accounting policies include revenue recognition, accounts and unbilled receivables, asset retirement obligation, inventory valuation, depletion, impairment of assets, income taxes, and stock-based compensation.\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements:**\n- Adoption of accounting standards related to leases and simplification of the goodwill impairment test."}
