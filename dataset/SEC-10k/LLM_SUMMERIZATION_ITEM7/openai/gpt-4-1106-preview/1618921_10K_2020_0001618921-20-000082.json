Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the Company's business and reportable segments in item 1 above. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below and in risk factors in part I, item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.\nCertain amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020.\nINTRODUCTION AND SEGMENTS\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ( Walgreens Boots Alliance\u201d) and its subsidiaries are a global leader in retail and wholesale pharmacy. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments:\n\u2022Retail Pharmacy USA;\n\u2022Retail Pharmacy International; and\n\u2022Pharmaceutical Wholesale\nSee note 16, segment reporting and note 17, sales further information.\nFACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS AND COMPARABILITY\nThe Company has been, and we expect it to continue to be, affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. These factors include: the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 (\"COVID-19\") pandemic on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including AmerisourceBergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing or distribution policies; strategic transactions and acquisitions, including the acquisition of stores and other assets from Rite Aid; joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including the U.S. tax law changes; changes in trade, tariffs, including trade relations between the United States and China, and international relations, including the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our Transformational Cost Management Program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events; and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates. These and other factors can affect the Company's operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.\nEstimated COVID-19 impacts and uncertainties\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19, was reported. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d on January 30, 2020 and a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has severely impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the economies of the U.S., the UK and other countries around the world. COVID-19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations. Further, financial and credit markets have experienced and may again experience volatility and turmoil. Policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 have resulted in, among other things, temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in U.S., UK and other countries, reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of work-from-home policies.\nCOVID-19 adversely affected global economic conditions in fiscal 2020 and the Company expects this will continue into fiscal 2021 and possibly longer. The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with customers, government officials, team members and business partners and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as developments in our business. As COVID-19 impacts the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world, the Company has put preparedness plans in place at our facilities to maintain continuity of our operations, while also taking steps to keep our team members healthy and safe.\n- 36 -\nDuring the fiscal 2020, we experienced certain adverse impacts of COVID-19, particularly in the second half of fiscal 2020. Sales were adversely impacted with the majority of the decline within the Retail Pharmacy International division, reflecting a significant reduction in footfall in Boots UK stores, particularly in major high street, train stations and airport locations due to government restrictions. Footfall did, however, improve steadily in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. While most Boots stores remained open throughout the UK lockdown to provide communities with pharmacy and essential healthcare, our largest premium beauty and fragrance counters were effectively closed. During the three months ended May 31, 2020, more than 100 Boots stores, mainly in high street, train stations and airport locations, were temporarily closed as were nearly all of the 600 Boots Opticians stores. Globally pharmacy volume was impacted by a decline in doctor visits and hospital patient admissions in the third quarter. However, trends improved in the three months ended August 31, 2020 in new to therapy scripts compared to the prior quarter. Additionally, retail gross margin was adversely impacted by sales mix, with a shift from higher margin discretionary categories to lower margin essential categories, and by higher supply chain costs. The Company took measures to keep stores open during COVID-19, incurring incremental selling, general and administrative expenses, including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning. Operating income was significantly and adversely impacted as a result of the foregoing factors. In addition, due to the significant impact of COVID-19 on the financial performance of the Retail Pharmacy International division, the company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain intangibles in Boots UK, which resulted in the recording of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $2.0 billion during the three months ended May 31, 2020.\nIn an effort to strengthen our liquidity position while navigating COVID-19, we have taken a number of proactive steps since March 2020, including the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt securities, entry into new and extended credit facilities, establishing a euro commercial paper program and suspending activity under our 2018 stock repurchase program, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources below.\nIn response to COVID-19, various domestic and foreign federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives have been implemented designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from COVID-19. The Company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the Company. It has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the CARES Act in the U.S. and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the UK, and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe Company has also taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives, such as digital 'order ahead' drive-thru with an increased range of products available for drive-thru pick-up, and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the U.S. To continue to work with customers and manage through the pandemic, the Company has launched a new COVID-19 testing program for businesses and also completed more than two million COVID-19 tests across the US and UK. The Company also took certain actions during fiscal 2020 to partly mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through cost containment across the Company including temporary store closures, furloughing approximately 16,000 UK employees at the peak of the crisis, decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations.\nAs a result of COVID-19, a portion of our global workforce, including employees and extended workforce, rapidly shifted to a working from home environment beginning in March 2020 and many continue to work remotely. While our system of internal controls were not specifically designed and implemented to accommodate for this shift, we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the second half of fiscal 2020 as described in Item 9A. Controls and procedures below. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the COVID-19 situation and its internal controls and seek to mitigate any impact on their design and operating effectiveness.\nThe Company anticipates additional mandates and directives, including revisions thereto, from foreign, federal, state, county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and for some time thereafter. The impact of this activity on the U.S. and global economies and consumer, customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments. As a result, the financial and/or operational impact these COVID-19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the collective impact could be material and adverse.\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business and geographies, including how it is impacting our customers, team members, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. However, the future impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position and operating results may be affected by numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, governmental, business or other actions, impacts on our supply chain, the effect on customer demand, store closures or changes to our operations. The health of our workforce, and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores, distribution facilities, wholesale operations and other critical functions cannot be predicted and is vital to our operations. The impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to,\n- 37 -\nand volatility in, the credit and financial markets and consumer spending, as well as other unanticipated consequences, remain unknown. Further, additional waves of COVID-19 in fiscal 2021 or beyond would cause many of the impacts described herein to return or be exacerbated. In addition, we cannot predict with certainty the impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us.\nFor further information, please see item 1A, risk factors in this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\u201d, and in item 1A, risk factors, in this report.\nU.S. recent events\nDuring the fiscal 2020, significant looting impacted certain stores with varying degrees of damage throughout the United States. As a result, the Company recognized $68 million charge during the fiscal 2020 for estimated store damage and inventory losses, net of insurance recoveries. The resulting store closures adversely affected sales.\nStore damage and inventory losses related to these recent events are recognized as the costs are incurred in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d). The Company treats these charges as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.\nThe impact of Brexit\nFollowing the June 2016 advisory referendum, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) on January 31, 2020. It began a transition period until December 31, 2020 in which to negotiate a new trading relationship for goods and services. Failure to complete negotiations by the deadline could result in the United Kingdom becoming subject to trade agreements with the European Union that are less favorable than those currently in effect. In addition, since the referendum, there has been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market condition in the United Kingdom. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have on our business, particularly United Kingdom and other European operations; however, Brexit and its related effects could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or operating results. For more information relating to this topic, see Risk Factors-Our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.\u201d\nTRANSFORMATIONAL COST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nOn December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that was expected at that time to deliver in excess of $1.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the Transformational Cost Management Program\u201d). As of the date of this report, the Company now expects to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022, an increase from the previously reported expectations of annual cost savings in excess of $1.8 billion in October 2019 and $1.5 billion in April 2019. The Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Company's information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program. The actions under the Transformational Cost Management Program focus on all reportable segments and the Company's global functions. Divisional optimization within each of the Company's segments includes activities such as optimization of stores including plans to exit approximately 200 Boots stores in the United Kingdom and approximately 250 stores in the United States, as compared to the 200 stores previously reported in July 2020.\nThe Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. The Company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in future cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, IT transformation and lease and other real estate payments.\n- 38 -\nThe Company currently estimates that it will recognize aggregate pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results related to Transformational Cost Management Program as follows:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transformational Cost Program Activities </td> <td>Range of Charges </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations and other real estate costs1\n</td> <td>$350 to 400 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments2\n</td> <td>$350 to 400 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee severance and business transition costs </td> <td>$850 to 950 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Information technology transformation and other exit costs </td> <td>$250 to 300 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cumulative pre-tax exit and disposal charges </td> <td>$1.8 to 2.1 billion </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other IT transformation costs </td> <td>$300 to 350 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total estimated pre-tax charges </td> <td>$2.1 to 2.4 billion </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Includes impairments relating to operating lease right-of-use and finance lease assets.\n2Primarily related to fixed asset write-offs from store closures, information technology and other asset write-offs.\nIn addition to the impacts discussed above, as a result of the actions related to store closures taken under the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Company recorded $508 million of transition adjustments to decrease retained earnings due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (Topic 842) that became effective on September 1, 2019. See note 1, summary of major accounting policies, for additional information.\nSince the inception of the Transformational Cost Management Program to August 31, 2020, the Company has recognized aggregate cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with GAAP of $1.3 billion, of which $1.2 billion is recorded as exit and disposal activities. See note 3, exit and disposal activities, for additional information. These charges included $242 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs, $350 million in asset impairments, $420 million in employee severance and business transition costs, $140 million of information technology transformation and other exit costs, and $118 million in other information technology costs.\nCosts under the Transformational Cost Management Program, which were primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and included in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 and August 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twelve Months Ended August 31, 2020 </td> <td>Retail Pharmacy USA </td> <td> </td> <td>Retail Pharmacy International </td> <td> </td> <td>Pharmaceutical Wholesale </td> <td> </td> <td>Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations and other real estate costs1\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee severance and business transition costs </td> <td>159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Information technology transformation and other exit costs </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pre-tax exit and disposal charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>720 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other IT transformation costs </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pre-tax charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>793 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Includes $166 million in impairments relating to operating lease right-of-use and finance lease assets.\n- 39 -\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twelve Months Ended August 31, 2019 </td> <td>Retail Pharmacy USA </td> <td> </td> <td>Retail Pharmacy International </td> <td> </td> <td>Pharmaceutical Wholesale </td> <td> </td> <td>Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations and other real estate costs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments1\n</td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>260 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee severance and business transition costs </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Information technology transformation and other exit costs </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pre-tax exit and disposal charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>432 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other IT transformation costs </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pre-tax charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>477 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Primarily includes write down of leasehold improvements, certain software and inventory.\nTransformational Cost Management Program charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP. The Company treats charges related to the Transformational Cost Management Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.\nThe amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\u201d below.\nRITE AID TRANSACTION\nAs of August 31, 2020, the Company has completed the acquisition of all 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers, and related inventory from Rite Aid Corporation for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration pursuant to an amended and restated asset purchase agreement entered into in September 2017.\nThe Company incurred $1.2 billion in costs and delivered $675 million in annual synergies and savings upon completion of the integration of the acquired stores and related assets and the completion of the Store Optimization Program described below.\nIntegration of acquired stores and related assets\nThe Company completed the integration of the acquired stores and related assets during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. Since fiscal 2018, the Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges of $813 million, which include pre-tax charges of $295 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2020 related to integration of the acquired stores and related assets. These charges were reported as acquisition-related costs and are treated as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures. The Company has achieved annual synergies from the transaction of more than $325 million derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters. In addition, the Company spent $503 million on store conversions and related activities.\nStore Optimization Program\nOn October 24, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the Store Optimization Program\u201d) to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately 600 stores and related assets within the\nCompany's Retail Pharmacy USA segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite\nAid. The Company closed 769 stores and related assets, as compared to its previous estimate of 750 stores and related assets. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company has achieved the targeted cost savings of $350 million from the Store Optimization Program.\nThe Company recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of $349 million , primarily within selling, general and administrative expenses, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs and employee severance and other exit costs. The Company incurred pre-tax charges of approximately $160 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $189 million for employee severance and other exit costs. Substantially all of the cumulative pre-tax charges resulted in cash expenditures for the Company. Store Optimization Program charges were treated as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.\nINVESTMENT IN AMERISOURCEBERGEN\nAs of August 31, 2020, the Company owned 56,854,867 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (representing approximately 28% of its outstanding common stock based on most recent share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen) and may, subject to certain conditions, acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market.\n- 40 -\nThe Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the Company's Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. The financial performance of AmerisourceBergen, including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation, will impact the Company's results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergen's common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment.

For discussion related to the results of operations by segment for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2019.\nFiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nFiscal 2020 net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance decreased 88.5 percent to $456 million, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 88.0 percent to $0.52 compared with the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects third quarter non-cash impairment charges, adverse COVID-19 impacts, lower U.S. pharmacy gross profit, and year on year bonus changes partially offset by savings from Transformational Cost Management Program. Diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year.\nOther income for fiscal 2020 was $70 million compared to $233 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease primarily reflects gains resulting from the termination of the option granted to Rite Aid to become a member of the Company's group purchasing organization in fiscal 2019.\nInterest was a net expense of $639 million and $704 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 48.5% and 13.0%, respectively. The net increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to third quarter non-tax deductible impairment charges and deferred tax impact of the UK rate change.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2020 decreased 24.5 percent to $4.2 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2020 decreased 20.8 percent to $4.74 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both negatively impacted by 0.2 percentage points as a result of currency translation.\nExcluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to COVID-19 adverse impacts, lower U.S. pharmacy gross profit and year on year bonus changes partially offset by savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year.

This adjustment reflects that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.\n5Comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months. Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable store sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively, in such stores. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods. The twelve months ended August 31, 2020 figures include an adjustment to remove February 29, 2020 results due to the leap year.\nSales fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nThe Retail Pharmacy USA division's sales for fiscal 2020 increased by 3.0% to $107.7 billion. Sales in comparable stores increased by 2.8% in fiscal 2020.\nPharmacy sales increased by 4.3% in fiscal 2020 and represented 74.7% of the division's sales. The increase in fiscal 2020 is due to higher brand inflation and growth in specialty sales. In fiscal 2019, pharmacy sales increased 8.6% and represented 73.8% of the division's sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 3.2% in fiscal 2020 compared to an increase of 4.0% in fiscal 2019. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 2.4% in fiscal 2020 compared to a reduction of 1.2% in fiscal 2019. The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 1.7% in fiscal 2020 compared to a reduction of 0.8% for fiscal 2019. Third-party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.2% of prescription sales for fiscal 2020 compared to 97.1% for fiscal 2019. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2020 was 818.0 million compared to 843.7 million in fiscal 2019. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 1,165.3 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 1,150.1 million in fiscal 2019.\nRetail sales decreased by 0.4% in fiscal 2020 and were 25.3% of the division's sales. In comparison, fiscal 2019 retail sales were flat and comprised 26.2% of the division's sales. Comparable retail sales increased 1.6% in fiscal 2020 and decreased 2.4% in fiscal 2019. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by health & wellness, including a favorable cough cold and flu season and personal care categories partially offset by the continued de-emphasis of tobacco.\nOperating income fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy USA division's operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 34.1% to $2.7 billion. The decrease was primarily due to U.S pharmacy reimbursement pressure and COVID-19 adverse impacts partially offset by a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.\nGross margin was 20.6% in fiscal 2020 compared to 22.5% in fiscal 2019. Gross margin was negatively impacted in fiscal 2020 by pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.1% in fiscal 2020 compared to 18.6% in fiscal 2019. As a percentage of sales, expenses were lower in the current period primarily due to savings related to the Transformational Cost Management Program and gains on sale-leaseback transactions partially offset by costs related to the Company's Transformational Cost Management Program and year-on-year bonus impact.\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy USA division's adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 22.0% to $4.1 billion. The decrease was primarily due to lower pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure, and COVID-19 adverse impacts partially offset by a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.\nSee --Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\n- 44 -\nRetail Pharmacy International\nThis division comprises retail pharmacy businesses operating in countries outside of the United States and in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Euro, Chilean peso and Mexican peso.

Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable store sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency refer to total sales, pharmacy sales and retail sales, respectively, in such stores. The method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency may not be the same as other retailers' methods. The Company presents certain information related to current period operating results in constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Comparable store sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency exclude the effects of\n- 45 -\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See --Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d The twelve months ended August 31, 2020 figures include an adjustment to remove February 29, 2020 results due to the leap year.\nSales fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy International division's sales for fiscal 2020 decreased 12.7% to $10.0 billion. The negative impact of currency translation on sales was 1.6 percentage points. Comparable stores sales in constant currency decreased 10.4 percent mainly due to lower retail sales in Boots UK, driven by a reduction in store foot traffic due to the impact of COVID-19.\nPharmacy sales decreased 4.3% in fiscal 2020 and represented 39.0% of the division's sales. The negative impact of currency translation on pharmacy sales was 2.7 percentage points. Comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency increased 0.3 percent as favorable National Health Service reimbursement levels mitigated the impact of lower prescription volume and reduced demand for services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Boots UK.\nRetail sales decreased 17.4% for fiscal 2020 and represented 61.0% of the division's sales. The negative impact of currency translation on retail sales was 1.0 percentage points. Comparable retail sales in constant currency decreased 17.2 percent reflecting lower Boots UK retail sales, as footfall in stores in the second half of the year was significantly reduced due to COVID-19, particularly in major high street, train station and airport locations.\nOperating income fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy International division's operating loss for fiscal 2020 was $2.1 billion, compared to an operating income of $438 million in fiscal 2019. Operating income was positively impacted by 2.1 percentage points ($9 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in operating income was primarily in the UK, due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the Boots reporting unit and lower gross profit reflecting lower sales from COVID-19 restrictions in Boots UK and Opticians.\nGross profit decreased 17.3% in fiscal 2020. Gross profit was negatively impacted by 1.3 percentage points ($60 million) of currency translation, the remaining decrease was mainly due to lower retail sales in Boots UK and Opticians, higher fulfillment costs and lower supplier contributions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 43.4% from fiscal 2019. Expenses were positively impacted by 1.7 percentage points ($69 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase was almost entirely due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the Boots reporting unit partially offset by short term cost mitigation initiatives. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 58.6% in fiscal 2020, compared to 35.6% in the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy International division's adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 82.6% to $130 million. Adjusted operating income was positively impacted by 1.0 percentage points ($8 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to lower retail sales in the UK including the impact of COVID-19.

See --Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nThe following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThese supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because the Company's management has evaluated its financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented.\nThe Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the United States reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

These adjustments include acquisition-related amortization and acquisition-related costs and were immaterial for periods prior to the quarter ended May 31, 2019. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees.\nThe Company considers certain metrics presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as comparable store sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, to be key performance indicators because the Company's management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures, which are described in more detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.\n- 51 -\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash and cash equivalents were $0.5 billion (including $0.2 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2020, compared to $1.0 billion (including $0.4 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2019. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds.\nThe Company's long-term capital policy is to: maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in its core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Company's Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Company's dividend policy to set forth the Company's current intention to increase its dividend each year.\nCash provided by operations and the incurrence of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $5.6 billion in fiscal 2019 and $8.3 billion in fiscal 2018. The $0.1 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities is mainly due to lower cash inflows from net earnings and higher cash outflows from trade accounts payable, partially offset by higher cash inflows from accrued expenses and other liabilities and accounts receivable. Changes in trade accounts payable are mainly driven by timing of collections and payments and working capital initiatives. Changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities are mainly driven by timing of accrual, prior year cash payments for certain legal and regulatory settlements, and working capital initiatives. Changes in accounts receivable are mainly driven by timing of collections and payments.\nNet cash used for investing activities was $1.3 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2019 and $5.5 billion in fiscal 2018. Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2020 were $0.7 billion compared to $0.7 billion in fiscal 2019 and $4.8 billion in fiscal 2018. Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2018 include the acquisition of Rite Aid assets and the investment in GuoDa. Additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2020 were $1.4 billion compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2019 and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2018.

Proceeds related to employee stock plans were $55 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $174 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. Cash dividends paid were $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2019 and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2018.\nThe Company expects to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations from liquidity sources including cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities, commercial paper programs, working capital financing arrangements and current cash and investment balances. The Company believes that these sources, and the ability to obtain other financing will provide adequate cash funds for the Company's foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. The Company's cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. Additionally, the Company's cash requirements, and its ability to generate cash flow, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 and the resulting market volatility and instability.\n- 52 -\nAs described in more detail below, during the second half of fiscal 2020, the Company took actions intended to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of COVID-19 and uncertainty in the global markets, including issuing $1.0 billion of 4.10% notes due 2050 and $0.5 billion of 3.20% notes due 2030. Additionally, the Company entered into several new credit facilities totaling $3.6 billion, increasing its total undrawn committed credit facilities to $11.5 billion as of August 31, 2020. The Company has total borrowings of approximately $2.6 billion outstanding under the credit facilities and commercial paper program described herein, of which $1.5 billion was commercial paper, as of August 31, 2020.\nAdditionally, on August 10, 2020, a subsidiary of the Company established a new commercial paper program for the purpose of issuing short term, unsecured commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount up to \u20ac1.0 billion. These commercial paper notes are guaranteed by the Company. This subsidiary has been approved as an eligible issuer under the Joint HM Treasury and Bank of England's COVID Corporate Financing Facility commercial paper program. For further information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the Company, including on its liquidity and capital resources, please see item 1A, risk factors in this report.\nSee item 3, qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk, below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.\nStock repurchase program\nIn June 2018, the Company authorized a stock repurchase program (the June 2018 stock repurchase program\u201d), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Company's common stock of which the Company had repurchased $8.0 billion as of August 31, 2020. The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date. In July 2020, the Company announced that it is suspending activities under this program. The Company may continue to repurchase stock to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans.\nThe Company purchased 30 million and 57 million shares under stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2020 and 2019 at a cost of $1.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under federal securities laws.\nCommercial paper\nThe Company periodically borrows under its commercial paper program and may borrow under it in future periods. The Company had $1.5 billion commercial paper outstanding as of August 31, 2020 and $2.4 billion as of August 31, 2019. The Company had average daily commercial paper outstanding of $2.5 billion, $2.7 billion and $1.4 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 2.15%, 3.07% and 2.11% for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.\nFinancing actions\nOn August 29, 2018, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) with the lenders and letter of credit issuers from time to time party thereto. The August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement is an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate commitment in the amount of $3.5 billion, with a letter of credit subfacility commitment amount of $500 million.

Borrowings under the August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, the alternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on the Company's credit ratings. As of August 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOn November 30, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto on March 25, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to such credit agreement (such credit agreement, as so amended the November 2018 Credit Agreement\u201d) reflecting certain changes to the borrowing notice provisions thereto and on April 2, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the November 2018 Credit Agreement (such credit agreement as so further amended, the Amended November 2018 Credit Agreement\u201d), which second amendment became effective as of May 29, 2020. As of May 29, 2020, the $500 million revolving credit facility portion of the November 2018 Credit Agreement was converted into a term loan facility, such that the Amended November 2018 Credit Agreement consists of a $1.0 billion senior unsecured term loan facility. The facility termination date is the earlier of (a) May 29, 2021 and (b) the date of acceleration of all loans under the Amended November 2018 Credit Agreement pursuant to its terms. Borrowings under the Amended November 2018 Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, the\n- 53 -\nalternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, plus an applicable margin of 1.25% in the case of Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.125% in the case of alternative base rate loans. As of August 31, 2020, there were $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Amended November 2018 Credit Agreement.\nOn December 5, 2018, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto and, on August 9, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to such credit agreement (such credit agreement as so amended, the \"December 2018 Credit Agreement\") to permit the Company to borrow, repay and reborrow amounts borrowed thereunder prior to the maturity date. On April 2, 2020, the Company amended and restated the December 2018 Credit Agreement (such credit agreement as so amended and restated, the A&R December 2018 Credit Agreement\u201d). The A&R December 2018 Credit Agreement governs a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, consisting of the initial $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving facility (the \"Initial Facility\") previously governed by the December 2018 Credit Agreement and a new $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"New Facility\"). The facility termination date is the earlier of (a) January 29, 2021 (the \"Initial Maturity Date\") (which date shall be extended to February 26, 2021 or July 31, 2021 pursuant to the terms of the A&R December 2018 Credit Agreement if the Company extends the maturity date of certain of its existing credit agreements or enters into new bank or bond financings with a certain maturity date and above an aggregate principal amount as described in the A&R December 2018 Credit Agreement) and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate amount of the commitments pursuant to the A&R December 2018 Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the A&R December 2018 Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, the alternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, plus an applicable margin of (i) in the case of the Initial Facility from April 2, 2020 through and including the Initial Maturity Date, 0.75% in the case of Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.00% in the case of alternate base rate loans and (ii) in the case of the New Facility and the Initial Facility after the Initial Maturity Date, 1.50% in the case of Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.50% in the case of alternate base rate loans.

On July 27, 2020, the December 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement matured and the Company paid all amounts due in connection therewith.\nOn January 18, 2019, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement (as extended, the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) with the lenders from time to time party thereto. The January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement is a senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility, with a facility termination date of the earlier of (a) 364 days following January 31, 2019, the date of the effectiveness of the commitments pursuant to the January 364- Day Revolving Credit Agreement, subject to extension thereof pursuant to the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate amount of the commitments pursuant to the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement. On December 18, 2019, the Company entered into an Extension Agreement (the Extension Agreement\u201d) relating to the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto and Mizuho, as administrative agent. The Extension Agreement extends the Maturity Date (as defined in the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement) for an additional period of 364 days to January 28, 2021. Such extension became effective on January 30, 2020. Borrowings under the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, the alternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on the Company's credit ratings. As of August 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the January 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOn August 30, 2019, the Company entered into three $500 million revolving credit agreements (together, the August 2019 Revolving Credit Agreements\u201d and each individually, an August 2019 Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) with the lenders from time to time party thereto.

As of August 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the April 7, 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOn April 15, 2020, the Company issued in an underwritten public offering $0.5 billion of 3.20% notes due 2030 and $1.0 billion of 4.10% notes due 2050. Total issuance costs relating to the notes, including underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses were $13.3 million.\nOn September 17, 2020, the Company provided notice to the trustee and the holders of its 2.875% notes due 2020 issued by the Company on November 20, 2014 that it will redeem in full the \u00a3400 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes on October 20, 2020.\nDebt covenants\nEach of the Company's credit facilities described above contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60:1.00, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of August 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all such applicable covenants.\nCredit ratings\nAs of October 14, 2020, the credit ratings of Walgreens Boots Alliance were:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating agency </td> <td>Long-term debt rating </td> <td>Commercial\npaper rating </td> <td>Outlook </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch </td> <td>BBB- </td> <td>F3 </td> <td>Stable </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's </td> <td>Baa2 </td> <td>P-2 </td> <td>Negative </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's </td> <td>BBB </td> <td>A-2 </td> <td>Negative </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn assessing the Company's credit strength, each rating agency considers various factors including the Company's business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. The Company's credit ratings impact its borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Company's debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nAmerisourceBergen relationship\nAs of August 31, 2020, the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 28% of the outstanding common stock based on most recent share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergen's board of directors. As of August 31, 2020, the Company can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergen's board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. Subject to applicable legal and contractual requirements, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to\n- 55 -\ninstruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1. See note 5, equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe information set forth in note 10, commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. The Company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:\nBusiness combinations - The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.\nFor intangible assets, the Company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.\nJudgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.\nLeases - The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. The lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. The commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the Company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nThe lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there is significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the Company's economic and strategic initiatives. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.\nThe Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. These are expensed as incurred. The Company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that\n- 56 -\nincludes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.\nFinance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Company's impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.\nDuring the three months ended May 31, 2020, the Company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets related to its two reporting units within Retail Pharmacy International division, Boots and Other international, as a result of the significant impact of COVID-19 on their financial performance. Based on this analysis, the Company recorded impairment charges of $1.7 billion on Boots goodwill and $0.3 billion on certain indefinite-lived Boots tradename assets.\nBased on the annual evaluation as of June 1, 2020 valuation date, the fair values of the Company's reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4% to approximately 239% excluding Boots reporting unit for which the excess of fair value over carrying amount was nominal due to an impairment charge recognized during the three months ended May 31, 2020. Other international reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 4% compared to 16% on June 1, 2019. As of August 31, 2020, the carrying values of goodwill were $1.1 billion and $0.5 billion for Boots reporting unit and Other international reporting unit, respectively. The fair values of certain indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4% to approximately 31%, excluding certain indefinite-lived Boots tradename assets for which the excess of fair values over carrying amounts were nominal due to impairment charges recognized during the three months ended May 31, 2020. As of August 31, 2020, the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit was $7.2 billion. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment of $73 million on its pharmacy licenses in the Boots reporting unit.\nThe determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions including the business and financial performance of the Company's reporting units, as well as how such performance may be impacted by COVID-19. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures, including considering the impact of COVID-19.\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, including the impact of COVID-19, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability. The Company will continue to monitor these potential impacts, including the impact of COVID-19 and economic, industry and market trends and the impact these may have on Boots and Other international reporting units.\nThe Company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the Company's fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company's equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.\n- 57 -\nSee note 6, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nImpairment of long lived assets - The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Long-lived assets related to the Company's retail operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. Fair value of the asset group is generally determined using income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.\nThe determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.\nCost of sales and inventory - Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.\nCost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) method for the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and primarily on a first-in first-out ( FIFO\u201d) basis for inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments.\nEquity method investments - The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Company's ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.\nThe Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.\nPension and postretirement benefits - The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.\nIn determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the Company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $438.8 million to the Company's pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the Company's pension expense by $23.7 million.\nThe Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.\nIncome taxes -The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of\n- 58 -\nlimitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nIn determining its provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the United States. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nThe following table lists the Company's contractual obligations and commitments at August 31, 2020 (in millions):\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>Over 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligation1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,559 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>1,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,230 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations: </td> <td> </td> <td>4,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open inventory purchase orders*\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate development*\n</td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations*2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt and long-term debt**\n</td> <td> </td> <td>15,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,816 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payment on short-term debt and long-term debt*\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,704 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement benefit obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment commitment*3\n</td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities reflected on the balance sheet4\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,547 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not recorded on balance sheet.\n** Excluding debt discounts and issuance costs and finance lease obligations.\n1Amounts do not include certain operating expenses under these leases such as common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes and rental payments based on sales volume, where appropriate.

These factors include: the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 (\"COVID-19\") pandemic on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including AmerisourceBergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing or distribution policies; strategic transactions and acquisitions, including the acquisition of stores and other assets from Rite Aid; joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including the U.S. tax law changes; changes in trade, tariffs, including trade relations between the United States and China, and international relations, including the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our Transformational Cost Management Program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events; and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates. These and other factors can affect the Company's operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.\nEstimated COVID-19 impacts and uncertainties\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19, was reported. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d on January 30, 2020 and a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has severely impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the economies of the U.S., the UK and other countries around the world. COVID-19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations. Further, financial and credit markets have experienced and may again experience volatility and turmoil. Policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 have resulted in, among other things, temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in U.S., UK and other countries, reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of work-from-home policies.\nCOVID-19 adversely affected global economic conditions in fiscal 2020 and the Company expects this will continue into fiscal 2021 and possibly longer. The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with customers, government officials, team members and business partners and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as developments in our business. As COVID-19 impacts the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world, the Company has put preparedness plans in place at our facilities to maintain continuity of our operations, while also taking steps to keep our team members healthy and safe.\n- 36 -\nDuring the fiscal 2020, we experienced certain adverse impacts of COVID-19, particularly in the second half of fiscal 2020. Sales were adversely impacted with the majority of the decline within the Retail Pharmacy International division, reflecting a significant reduction in footfall in Boots UK stores, particularly in major high street, train stations and airport locations due to government restrictions. Footfall did, however, improve steadily in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. While most Boots stores remained open throughout the UK lockdown to provide communities with pharmacy and essential healthcare, our largest premium beauty and fragrance counters were effectively closed. During the three months ended May 31, 2020, more than 100 Boots stores, mainly in high street, train stations and airport locations, were temporarily closed as were nearly all of the 600 Boots Opticians stores. Globally pharmacy volume was impacted by a decline in doctor visits and hospital patient admissions in the third quarter. However, trends improved in the three months ended August 31, 2020 in new to therapy scripts compared to the prior quarter. Additionally, retail gross margin was adversely impacted by sales mix, with a shift from higher margin discretionary categories to lower margin essential categories, and by higher supply chain costs. The Company took measures to keep stores open during COVID-19, incurring incremental selling, general and administrative expenses, including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning. Operating income was significantly and adversely impacted as a result of the foregoing factors. In addition, due to the significant impact of COVID-19 on the financial performance of the Retail Pharmacy International division, the company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain intangibles in Boots UK, which resulted in the recording of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $2.0 billion during the three months ended May 31, 2020.\nIn an effort to strengthen our liquidity position while navigating COVID-19, we have taken a number of proactive steps since March 2020, including the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt securities, entry into new and extended credit facilities, establishing a euro commercial paper program and suspending activity under our 2018 stock repurchase program, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources below.\nIn response to COVID-19, various domestic and foreign federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives have been implemented designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from COVID-19. The Company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the Company. It has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the CARES Act in the U.S. and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the UK, and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe Company has also taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives, such as digital 'order ahead' drive-thru with an increased range of products available for drive-thru pick-up, and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the U.S. To continue to work with customers and manage through the pandemic, the Company has launched a new COVID-19 testing program for businesses and also completed more than two million COVID-19 tests across the US and UK. The Company also took certain actions during fiscal 2020 to partly mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through cost containment across the Company including temporary store closures, furloughing approximately 16,000 UK employees at the peak of the crisis, decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations.\nAs a result of COVID-19, a portion of our global workforce, including employees and extended workforce, rapidly shifted to a working from home environment beginning in March 2020 and many continue to work remotely. While our system of internal controls were not specifically designed and implemented to accommodate for this shift, we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the second half of fiscal 2020 as described in Item 9A. Controls and procedures below. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the COVID-19 situation and its internal controls and seek to mitigate any impact on their design and operating effectiveness.\nThe Company anticipates additional mandates and directives, including revisions thereto, from foreign, federal, state, county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and for some time thereafter. The impact of this activity on the U.S. and global economies and consumer, customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments. As a result, the financial and/or operational impact these COVID-19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the collective impact could be material and adverse.\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business and geographies, including how it is impacting our customers, team members, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. However, the future impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position and operating results may be affected by numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, governmental, business or other actions, impacts on our supply chain, the effect on customer demand, store closures or changes to our operations. The health of our workforce, and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores, distribution facilities, wholesale operations and other critical functions cannot be predicted and is vital to our operations. The impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to,\n- 37 -\nand volatility in, the credit and financial markets and consumer spending, as well as other unanticipated consequences, remain unknown. Further, additional waves of COVID-19 in fiscal 2021 or beyond would cause many of the impacts described herein to return or be exacerbated. In addition, we cannot predict with certainty the impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us.\nFor further information, please see item 1A, risk factors in this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\u201d, and in item 1A, risk factors, in this report.\nU.S. recent events\nDuring the fiscal 2020, significant looting impacted certain stores with varying degrees of damage throughout the United States. As a result, the Company recognized $68 million charge during the fiscal 2020 for estimated store damage and inventory losses, net of insurance recoveries. The resulting store closures adversely affected sales.\nStore damage and inventory losses related to these recent events are recognized as the costs are incurred in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d). The Company treats these charges as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.\nThe impact of Brexit\nFollowing the June 2016 advisory referendum, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) on January 31, 2020. It began a transition period until December 31, 2020 in which to negotiate a new trading relationship for goods and services. Failure to complete negotiations by the deadline could result in the United Kingdom becoming subject to trade agreements with the European Union that are less favorable than those currently in effect. In addition, since the referendum, there has been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market condition in the United Kingdom. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have on our business, particularly United Kingdom and other European operations; however, Brexit and its related effects could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or operating results. For more information relating to this topic, see Risk Factors-Our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.\u201d\nTRANSFORMATIONAL COST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nOn December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that was expected at that time to deliver in excess of $1.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the Transformational Cost Management Program\u201d). As of the date of this report, the Company now expects to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022, an increase from the previously reported expectations of annual cost savings in excess of $1.8 billion in October 2019 and $1.5 billion in April 2019. The Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Company's information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program. The actions under the Transformational Cost Management Program focus on all reportable segments and the Company's global functions. Divisional optimization within each of the Company's segments includes activities such as optimization of stores including plans to exit approximately 200 Boots stores in the United Kingdom and approximately 250 stores in the United States, as compared to the 200 stores previously reported in July 2020.\nThe Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. The Company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in future cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, IT transformation and lease and other real estate payments.\n- 38 -\nThe Company currently estimates that it will recognize aggregate pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results related to Transformational Cost Management Program as follows:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transformational Cost Program Activities </td> <td>Range of Charges </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations and other real estate costs1\n</td> <td>$350 to 400 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments2\n</td> <td>$350 to 400 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee severance and business transition costs </td> <td>$850 to 950 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Information technology transformation and other exit costs </td> <td>$250 to 300 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cumulative pre-tax exit and disposal charges </td> <td>$1.8 to 2.1 billion </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other IT transformation costs </td> <td>$300 to 350 million </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total estimated pre-tax charges </td> <td>$2.1 to 2.4 billion </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Includes impairments relating to operating lease right-of-use and finance lease assets.\n2Primarily related to fixed asset write-offs from store closures, information technology and other asset write-offs.\nIn addition to the impacts discussed above, as a result of the actions related to store closures taken under the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Company recorded $508 million of transition adjustments to decrease retained earnings due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (Topic 842) that became effective on September 1, 2019.

The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\u201d below.\nRITE AID TRANSACTION\nAs of August 31, 2020, the Company has completed the acquisition of all 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers, and related inventory from Rite Aid Corporation for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration pursuant to an amended and restated asset purchase agreement entered into in September 2017.\nThe Company incurred $1.2 billion in costs and delivered $675 million in annual synergies and savings upon completion of the integration of the acquired stores and related assets and the completion of the Store Optimization Program described below.\nIntegration of acquired stores and related assets\nThe Company completed the integration of the acquired stores and related assets during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. Since fiscal 2018, the Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges of $813 million, which include pre-tax charges of $295 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2020 related to integration of the acquired stores and related assets. These charges were reported as acquisition-related costs and are treated as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures. The Company has achieved annual synergies from the transaction of more than $325 million derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters. In addition, the Company spent $503 million on store conversions and related activities.\nStore Optimization Program\nOn October 24, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the Store Optimization Program\u201d) to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately 600 stores and related assets within the\nCompany's Retail Pharmacy USA segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite\nAid. The Company closed 769 stores and related assets, as compared to its previous estimate of 750 stores and related assets. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company has achieved the targeted cost savings of $350 million from the Store Optimization Program.\nThe Company recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of $349 million , primarily within selling, general and administrative expenses, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs and employee severance and other exit costs. The Company incurred pre-tax charges of approximately $160 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $189 million for employee severance and other exit costs. Substantially all of the cumulative pre-tax charges resulted in cash expenditures for the Company. Store Optimization Program charges were treated as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.\nINVESTMENT IN AMERISOURCEBERGEN\nAs of August 31, 2020, the Company owned 56,854,867 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (representing approximately 28% of its outstanding common stock based on most recent share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen) and may, subject to certain conditions, acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market.\n- 40 -\nThe Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the Company's Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. The financial performance of AmerisourceBergen, including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation, will impact the Company's results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergen's common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. These considerations may materially and adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nFor more information, see Business - Relationship with AmerisourceBergen\u201d and note 5, equity method investments to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following table presents certain key financial statistics for the Company for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions, except per share amounts) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>28,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,792 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>27,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen </td> <td> </td> <td>341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>191 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,289 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure)1,2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,942 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,679 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before interest and income tax provision </td> <td> </td> <td>1,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,591 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,024 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

For discussion related to the results of operations by segment for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2019.\nFiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nFiscal 2020 net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance decreased 88.5 percent to $456 million, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 88.0 percent to $0.52 compared with the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects third quarter non-cash impairment charges, adverse COVID-19 impacts, lower U.S. pharmacy gross profit, and year on year bonus changes partially offset by savings from Transformational Cost Management Program. Diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year.\nOther income for fiscal 2020 was $70 million compared to $233 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease primarily reflects gains resulting from the termination of the option granted to Rite Aid to become a member of the Company's group purchasing organization in fiscal 2019.\nInterest was a net expense of $639 million and $704 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 48.5% and 13.0%, respectively. The net increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to third quarter non-tax deductible impairment charges and deferred tax impact of the UK rate change.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2020 decreased 24.5 percent to $4.2 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2020 decreased 20.8 percent to $4.74 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both negatively impacted by 0.2 percentage points as a result of currency translation.\nExcluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to COVID-19 adverse impacts, lower U.S. pharmacy gross profit and year on year bonus changes partially offset by savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year.

This adjustment reflects that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.\n5Comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months. Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable store sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively, in such stores. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods. The twelve months ended August 31, 2020 figures include an adjustment to remove February 29, 2020 results due to the leap year.\nSales fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nThe Retail Pharmacy USA division's sales for fiscal 2020 increased by 3.0% to $107.7 billion.

The increase in fiscal 2020 is due to higher brand inflation and growth in specialty sales. In fiscal 2019, pharmacy sales increased 8.6% and represented 73.8% of the division's sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 3.2% in fiscal 2020 compared to an increase of 4.0% in fiscal 2019. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 2.4% in fiscal 2020 compared to a reduction of 1.2% in fiscal 2019. The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 1.7% in fiscal 2020 compared to a reduction of 0.8% for fiscal 2019. Third-party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.2% of prescription sales for fiscal 2020 compared to 97.1% for fiscal 2019. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2020 was 818.0 million compared to 843.7 million in fiscal 2019. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 1,165.3 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 1,150.1 million in fiscal 2019.\nRetail sales decreased by 0.4% in fiscal 2020 and were 25.3% of the division's sales. In comparison, fiscal 2019 retail sales were flat and comprised 26.2% of the division's sales. Comparable retail sales increased 1.6% in fiscal 2020 and decreased 2.4% in fiscal 2019. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by health & wellness, including a favorable cough cold and flu season and personal care categories partially offset by the continued de-emphasis of tobacco.\nOperating income fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy USA division's operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 34.1% to $2.7 billion. The decrease was primarily due to U.S pharmacy reimbursement pressure and COVID-19 adverse impacts partially offset by a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.\nGross margin was 20.6% in fiscal 2020 compared to 22.5% in fiscal 2019. Gross margin was negatively impacted in fiscal 2020 by pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.1% in fiscal 2020 compared to 18.6% in fiscal 2019. As a percentage of sales, expenses were lower in the current period primarily due to savings related to the Transformational Cost Management Program and gains on sale-leaseback transactions partially offset by costs related to the Company's Transformational Cost Management Program and year-on-year bonus impact.\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy USA division's adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 22.0% to $4.1 billion. The decrease was primarily due to lower pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure, and COVID-19 adverse impacts partially offset by a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.\nSee --Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\n- 44 -\nRetail Pharmacy International\nThis division comprises retail pharmacy businesses operating in countries outside of the United States and in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Euro, Chilean peso and Mexican peso.

Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable store sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency refer to total sales, pharmacy sales and retail sales, respectively, in such stores. The method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency may not be the same as other retailers' methods. The Company presents certain information related to current period operating results in constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Comparable store sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency exclude the effects of\n- 45 -\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See --Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d The twelve months ended August 31, 2020 figures include an adjustment to remove February 29, 2020 results due to the leap year.\nSales fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy International division's sales for fiscal 2020 decreased 12.7% to $10.0 billion. The negative impact of currency translation on sales was 1.6 percentage points. Comparable stores sales in constant currency decreased 10.4 percent mainly due to lower retail sales in Boots UK, driven by a reduction in store foot traffic due to the impact of COVID-19.\nPharmacy sales decreased 4.3% in fiscal 2020 and represented 39.0% of the division's sales. The negative impact of currency translation on pharmacy sales was 2.7 percentage points. Comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency increased 0.3 percent as favorable National Health Service reimbursement levels mitigated the impact of lower prescription volume and reduced demand for services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Boots UK.\nRetail sales decreased 17.4% for fiscal 2020 and represented 61.0% of the division's sales. The negative impact of currency translation on retail sales was 1.0 percentage points. Comparable retail sales in constant currency decreased 17.2 percent reflecting lower Boots UK retail sales, as footfall in stores in the second half of the year was significantly reduced due to COVID-19, particularly in major high street, train station and airport locations.\nOperating income fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy International division's operating loss for fiscal 2020 was $2.1 billion, compared to an operating income of $438 million in fiscal 2019. Operating income was positively impacted by 2.1 percentage points ($9 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in operating income was primarily in the UK, due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the Boots reporting unit and lower gross profit reflecting lower sales from COVID-19 restrictions in Boots UK and Opticians.\nGross profit decreased 17.3% in fiscal 2020. Gross profit was negatively impacted by 1.3 percentage points ($60 million) of currency translation, the remaining decrease was mainly due to lower retail sales in Boots UK and Opticians, higher fulfillment costs and lower supplier contributions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 43.4% from fiscal 2019. Expenses were positively impacted by 1.7 percentage points ($69 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase was almost entirely due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the Boots reporting unit partially offset by short term cost mitigation initiatives. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 58.6% in fiscal 2020, compared to 35.6% in the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy International division's adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 82.6% to $130 million. Adjusted operating income was positively impacted by 1.0 percentage points ($8 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to lower retail sales in the UK including the impact of COVID-19.

This compared with operating income of $471 million in fiscal 2019, including $164 million from the Company's equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. Operating income was negatively impacted by $14 million as a result of currency translation. The increase in operating income was primarily due to costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program in fiscal 2019.\n- 47 -\nGross profit increased 1.1% from the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was negatively impacted by 2.2 percentage points ($44 million) as a result of currency translation.

Expenses were positively impacted by 1.8 percentage points ($30 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease was primarily due to costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program in fiscal 2019, partially offset by the impact of sales growth.

Adjusted operating income was negatively impacted by 1.5 percentage points ($14 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted operating income over the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher sales and a higher contribution from AmerisourceBergen, partially offset by lower gross margin and higher adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses.

The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThese supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because the Company's management has evaluated its financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented.\nThe Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the United States reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

These adjustments include acquisition-related amortization and acquisition-related costs and were immaterial for periods prior to the quarter ended May 31, 2019. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees.\nThe Company considers certain metrics presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as comparable store sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, to be key performance indicators because the Company's management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures, which are described in more detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.\n- 51 -\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash and cash equivalents were $0.5 billion (including $0.2 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2020, compared to $1.0 billion (including $0.4 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2019. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds.\nThe Company's long-term capital policy is to: maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in its core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Company's Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Company's dividend policy to set forth the Company's current intention to increase its dividend each year.\nCash provided by operations and the incurrence of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $5.6 billion in fiscal 2019 and $8.3 billion in fiscal 2018. The $0.1 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities is mainly due to lower cash inflows from net earnings and higher cash outflows from trade accounts payable, partially offset by higher cash inflows from accrued expenses and other liabilities and accounts receivable. Changes in trade accounts payable are mainly driven by timing of collections and payments and working capital initiatives. Changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities are mainly driven by timing of accrual, prior year cash payments for certain legal and regulatory settlements, and working capital initiatives. Changes in accounts receivable are mainly driven by timing of collections and payments.\nNet cash used for investing activities was $1.3 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2019 and $5.5 billion in fiscal 2018. Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2020 were $0.7 billion compared to $0.7 billion in fiscal 2019 and $4.8 billion in fiscal 2018. Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2018 include the acquisition of Rite Aid assets and the investment in GuoDa. Additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2020 were $1.4 billion compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2019 and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures by reporting segment were as follows (in millions):\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail Pharmacy USA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,022 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail Pharmacy International </td> <td> </td> <td>239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>241 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pharmaceutical Wholesale </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,702 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,367 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in our stores and information technology projects.\nNet cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2020 was $4.6 billion compared to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2019 and $5.3 billion in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2020 there were $20.4 billion in net proceeds compared to $12.4 billion in fiscal 2019 and $5.9 billion in fiscal 2018 primarily from revolving facilities described below and commercial paper debt. In fiscal 2020 there were $21.4 billion payments of debt made primarily for revolving facilities and commercial paper debt compared to $10.5 billion in fiscal 2019 and $4.9 billion in fiscal 2018. The Company repurchased shares as part of the stock repurchase programs described below and to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2019 and $5.2 billion in fiscal 2018. Proceeds related to employee stock plans were $55 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $174 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. Cash dividends paid were $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2019 and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2018.\nThe Company expects to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations from liquidity sources including cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities, commercial paper programs, working capital financing arrangements and current cash and investment balances. The Company believes that these sources, and the ability to obtain other financing will provide adequate cash funds for the Company's foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. The Company's cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. Additionally, the Company's cash requirements, and its ability to generate cash flow, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 and the resulting market volatility and instability.\n- 52 -\nAs described in more detail below, during the second half of fiscal 2020, the Company took actions intended to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of COVID-19 and uncertainty in the global markets, including issuing $1.0 billion of 4.10% notes due 2050 and $0.5 billion of 3.20% notes due 2030. Additionally, the Company entered into several new credit facilities totaling $3.6 billion, increasing its total undrawn committed credit facilities to $11.5 billion as of August 31, 2020. The Company has total borrowings of approximately $2.6 billion outstanding under the credit facilities and commercial paper program described herein, of which $1.5 billion was commercial paper, as of August 31, 2020.\nAdditionally, on August 10, 2020, a subsidiary of the Company established a new commercial paper program for the purpose of issuing short term, unsecured commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount up to \u20ac1.0 billion. These commercial paper notes are guaranteed by the Company. This subsidiary has been approved as an eligible issuer under the Joint HM Treasury and Bank of England's COVID Corporate Financing Facility commercial paper program.

The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date. In July 2020, the Company announced that it is suspending activities under this program. The Company may continue to repurchase stock to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans.\nThe Company purchased 30 million and 57 million shares under stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2020 and 2019 at a cost of $1.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under federal securities laws.\nCommercial paper\nThe Company periodically borrows under its commercial paper program and may borrow under it in future periods. The Company had $1.5 billion commercial paper outstanding as of August 31, 2020 and $2.4 billion as of August 31, 2019. The Company had average daily commercial paper outstanding of $2.5 billion, $2.7 billion and $1.4 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 2.15%, 3.07% and 2.11% for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.\nFinancing actions\nOn August 29, 2018, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) with the lenders and letter of credit issuers from time to time party thereto.

There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. The Company's credit ratings impact its borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Company's debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nAmerisourceBergen relationship\nAs of August 31, 2020, the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 28% of the outstanding common stock based on most recent share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergen's board of directors. As of August 31, 2020, the Company can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergen's board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. Subject to applicable legal and contractual requirements, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to\n- 55 -\ninstruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1. See note 5, equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe information set forth in note 10, commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. The Company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:\nBusiness combinations - The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.\nFor intangible assets, the Company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.\nJudgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.\nLeases - The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. The lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. The commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the Company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nThe lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there is significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the Company's economic and strategic initiatives. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.\nThe Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. These are expensed as incurred. The Company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that\n- 56 -\nincludes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.\nFinance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Company's impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.\nDuring the three months ended May 31, 2020, the Company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets related to its two reporting units within Retail Pharmacy International division, Boots and Other international, as a result of the significant impact of COVID-19 on their financial performance. Based on this analysis, the Company recorded impairment charges of $1.7 billion on Boots goodwill and $0.3 billion on certain indefinite-lived Boots tradename assets.\nBased on the annual evaluation as of June 1, 2020 valuation date, the fair values of the Company's reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4% to approximately 239% excluding Boots reporting unit for which the excess of fair value over carrying amount was nominal due to an impairment charge recognized during the three months ended May 31, 2020. Other international reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 4% compared to 16% on June 1, 2019. As of August 31, 2020, the carrying values of goodwill were $1.1 billion and $0.5 billion for Boots reporting unit and Other international reporting unit, respectively. The fair values of certain indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4% to approximately 31%, excluding certain indefinite-lived Boots tradename assets for which the excess of fair values over carrying amounts were nominal due to impairment charges recognized during the three months ended May 31, 2020. As of August 31, 2020, the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit was $7.2 billion. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment of $73 million on its pharmacy licenses in the Boots reporting unit.\nThe determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions including the business and financial performance of the Company's reporting units, as well as how such performance may be impacted by COVID-19. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures, including considering the impact of COVID-19.\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, including the impact of COVID-19, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability. The Company will continue to monitor these potential impacts, including the impact of COVID-19 and economic, industry and market trends and the impact these may have on Boots and Other international reporting units.\nThe Company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the Company's fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company's equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.\n- 57 -\nSee note 6, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nImpairment of long lived assets - The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Long-lived assets related to the Company's retail operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. Fair value of the asset group is generally determined using income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.\nThe determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.\nCost of sales and inventory - Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.\nCost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) method for the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and primarily on a first-in first-out ( FIFO\u201d) basis for inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments.\nEquity method investments - The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Company's ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.\nThe Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.\nPension and postretirement benefits - The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.\nIn determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the Company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $438.8 million to the Company's pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the Company's pension expense by $23.7 million.\nThe Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.\nIncome taxes -The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of\n- 58 -\nlimitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nIn determining its provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the United States. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nThe following table lists the Company's contractual obligations and commitments at August 31, 2020 (in millions):\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>Over 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligation1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,559 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>1,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,230 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations: </td> <td> </td> <td>4,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open inventory purchase orders*\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate development*\n</td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations*2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt and long-term debt**\n</td> <td> </td> <td>15,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,816 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payment on short-term debt and long-term debt*\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,704 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement benefit obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment commitment*3\n</td> <td> </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities reflected on the balance sheet4\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,547 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not recorded on balance sheet.\n** Excluding debt discounts and issuance costs and finance lease obligations.\n1Amounts do not include certain operating expenses under these leases such as common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes and rental payments based on sales volume, where appropriate.

( Walgreens Boots Alliance\u201d) and its subsidiaries are a global leader in retail and wholesale pharmacy. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments:\n\u2022Retail Pharmacy USA;\n\u2022Retail Pharmacy International; and\n\u2022Pharmaceutical Wholesale\nSee note 16, segment reporting and note 17, sales further information.\nFACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS AND COMPARABILITY\nThe Company has been, and we expect it to continue to be, affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. These factors include: the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 (\"COVID-19\") pandemic on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including AmerisourceBergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing or distribution policies; strategic transactions and acquisitions, including the acquisition of stores and other assets from Rite Aid; joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including the U.S. tax law changes; changes in trade, tariffs, including trade relations between the United States and China, and international relations, including the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our Transformational Cost Management Program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events; and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates. These and other factors can affect the Company's operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.\nEstimated COVID-19 impacts and uncertainties\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19, was reported. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d on January 30, 2020 and a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has severely impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the economies of the U.S., the UK and other countries around the world. COVID-19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations. Further, financial and credit markets have experienced and may again experience volatility and turmoil. Policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 have resulted in, among other things, temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in U.S., UK and other countries, reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of work-from-home policies.\nCOVID-19 adversely affected global economic conditions in fiscal 2020 and the Company expects this will continue into fiscal 2021 and possibly longer. The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with customers, government officials, team members and business partners and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as developments in our business. As COVID-19 impacts the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world, the Company has put preparedness plans in place at our facilities to maintain continuity of our operations, while also taking steps to keep our team members healthy and safe.\n- 36 -\nDuring the fiscal 2020, we experienced certain adverse impacts of COVID-19, particularly in the second half of fiscal 2020. Sales were adversely impacted with the majority of the decline within the Retail Pharmacy International division, reflecting a significant reduction in footfall in Boots UK stores, particularly in major high street, train stations and airport locations due to government restrictions. Footfall did, however, improve steadily in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. While most Boots stores remained open throughout the UK lockdown to provide communities with pharmacy and essential healthcare, our largest premium beauty and fragrance counters were effectively closed. During the three months ended May 31, 2020, more than 100 Boots stores, mainly in high street, train stations and airport locations, were temporarily closed as were nearly all of the 600 Boots Opticians stores. Globally pharmacy volume was impacted by a decline in doctor visits and hospital patient admissions in the third quarter. However, trends improved in the three months ended August 31, 2020 in new to therapy scripts compared to the prior quarter. Additionally, retail gross margin was adversely impacted by sales mix, with a shift from higher margin discretionary categories to lower margin essential categories, and by higher supply chain costs. The Company took measures to keep stores open during COVID-19, incurring incremental selling, general and administrative expenses, including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning. Operating income was significantly and adversely impacted as a result of the foregoing factors. In addition, due to the significant impact of COVID-19 on the financial performance of the Retail Pharmacy International division, the company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain intangibles in Boots UK, which resulted in the recording of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $2.0 billion during the three months ended May 31, 2020.\nIn an effort to strengthen our liquidity position while navigating COVID-19, we have taken a number of proactive steps since March 2020, including the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt securities, entry into new and extended credit facilities, establishing a euro commercial paper program and suspending activity under our 2018 stock repurchase program, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources below.\nIn response to COVID-19, various domestic and foreign federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives have been implemented designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from COVID-19. The Company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the Company. It has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the CARES Act in the U.S. and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the UK, and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe Company has also taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives, such as digital 'order ahead' drive-thru with an increased range of products available for drive-thru pick-up, and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the U.S. To continue to work with customers and manage through the pandemic, the Company has launched a new COVID-19 testing program for businesses and also completed more than two million COVID-19 tests across the US and UK. The Company also took certain actions during fiscal 2020 to partly mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through cost containment across the Company including temporary store closures, furloughing approximately 16,000 UK employees at the peak of the crisis, decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations.\nAs a result of COVID-19, a portion of our global workforce, including employees and extended workforce, rapidly shifted to a working from home environment beginning in March 2020 and many continue to work remotely. While our system of internal controls were not specifically designed and implemented to accommodate for this shift, we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the second half of fiscal 2020 as described in Item 9A. Controls and procedures below. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the COVID-19 situation and its internal controls and seek to mitigate any impact on their design and operating effectiveness.\nThe Company anticipates additional mandates and directives, including revisions thereto, from foreign, federal, state, county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and for some time thereafter. The impact of this activity on the U.S. and global economies and consumer, customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments. As a result, the financial and/or operational impact these COVID-19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the collective impact could be material and adverse.\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business and geographies, including how it is impacting our customers, team members, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. However, the future impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position and operating results may be affected by numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, governmental, business or other actions, impacts on our supply chain, the effect on customer demand, store closures or changes to our operations. The health of our workforce, and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores, distribution facilities, wholesale operations and other critical functions cannot be predicted and is vital to our operations. The impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to,\n- 37 -\nand volatility in, the credit and financial markets and consumer spending, as well as other unanticipated consequences, remain unknown. Further, additional waves of COVID-19 in fiscal 2021 or beyond would cause many of the impacts described herein to return or be exacerbated. In addition, we cannot predict with certainty the impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us.\nFor further information, please see item 1A, risk factors in this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\u201d, and in item 1A, risk factors, in this report.\nU.S. recent events\nDuring the fiscal 2020, significant looting impacted certain stores with varying degrees of damage throughout the United States. As a result, the Company recognized $68 million charge during the fiscal 2020 for estimated store damage and inventory losses, net of insurance recoveries. The resulting store closures adversely affected sales.\nStore damage and inventory losses related to these recent events are recognized as the costs are incurred in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d). The Company treats these charges as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.\nThe impact of Brexit\nFollowing the June 2016 advisory referendum, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) on January 31, 2020. It began a transition period until December 31, 2020 in which to negotiate a new trading relationship for goods and services. Failure to complete negotiations by the deadline could result in the United Kingdom becoming subject to trade agreements with the European Union that are less favorable than those currently in effect. In addition, since the referendum, there has been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market condition in the United Kingdom. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have on our business, particularly United Kingdom and other European operations; however, Brexit and its related effects could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or operating results. For more information relating to this topic, see Risk Factors-Our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.\u201d\nTRANSFORMATIONAL COST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nOn December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that was expected at that time to deliver in excess of $1.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the Transformational Cost Management Program\u201d). As of the date of this report, the Company now expects to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022, an increase from the previously reported expectations of annual cost savings in excess of $1.8 billion in October 2019 and $1.5 billion in April 2019. The Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Company's information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program. The actions under the Transformational Cost Management Program focus on all reportable segments and the Company's global functions. Divisional optimization within each of the Company's segments includes activities such as optimization of stores including plans to exit approximately 200 Boots stores in the United Kingdom and approximately 250 stores in the United States, as compared to the 200 stores previously reported in July 2020.\nThe Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. The Company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in future cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, IT transformation and lease and other real estate payments.\n- 38 -\nThe Company currently estimates that it will recognize aggregate pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results related to Transformational Cost Management Program as follows:\n\n1Includes impairments relating to operating lease right-of-use and finance lease assets.\n2Primarily related to fixed asset write-offs from store closures, information technology and other asset write-offs.\nIn addition to the impacts discussed above, as a result of the actions related to store closures taken under the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Company recorded $508 million of transition adjustments to decrease retained earnings due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (Topic 842) that became effective on September 1, 2019. See note 1, summary of major accounting policies, for additional information.\nSince the inception of the Transformational Cost Management Program to August 31, 2020, the Company has recognized aggregate cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with GAAP of $1.3 billion, of which $1.2 billion is recorded as exit and disposal activities. See note 3, exit and disposal activities, for additional information. These charges included $242 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs, $350 million in asset impairments, $420 million in employee severance and business transition costs, $140 million of information technology transformation and other exit costs, and $118 million in other information technology costs.\nCosts under the Transformational Cost Management Program, which were primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and included in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 and August 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions):\n\n1Includes $166 million in impairments relating to operating lease right-of-use and finance lease assets.\n- 39 -\n\n1Primarily includes write down of leasehold improvements, certain software and inventory.\nTransformational Cost Management Program charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP. The Company treats charges related to the Transformational Cost Management Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.\nThe amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\u201d below.\nRITE AID TRANSACTION\nAs of August 31, 2020, the Company has completed the acquisition of all 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers, and related inventory from Rite Aid Corporation for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration pursuant to an amended and restated asset purchase agreement entered into in September 2017.\nThe Company incurred $1.2 billion in costs and delivered $675 million in annual synergies and savings upon completion of the integration of the acquired stores and related assets and the completion of the Store Optimization Program described below.\nIntegration of acquired stores and related assets\nThe Company completed the integration of the acquired stores and related assets during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. Since fiscal 2018, the Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges of $813 million, which include pre-tax charges of $295 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2020 related to integration of the acquired stores and related assets. These charges were reported as acquisition-related costs and are treated as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures. The Company has achieved annual synergies from the transaction of more than $325 million derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters. In addition, the Company spent $503 million on store conversions and related activities.\nStore Optimization Program\nOn October 24, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the Store Optimization Program\u201d) to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately 600 stores and related assets within the\nCompany's Retail Pharmacy USA segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite\nAid. The Company closed 769 stores and related assets, as compared to its previous estimate of 750 stores and related assets. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company has achieved the targeted cost savings of $350 million from the Store Optimization Program.\nThe Company recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of $349 million , primarily within selling, general and administrative expenses, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs and employee severance and other exit costs. The Company incurred pre-tax charges of approximately $160 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $189 million for employee severance and other exit costs. Substantially all of the cumulative pre-tax charges resulted in cash expenditures for the Company. Store Optimization Program charges were treated as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.\nINVESTMENT IN AMERISOURCEBERGEN\nAs of August 31, 2020, the Company owned 56,854,867 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (representing approximately 28% of its outstanding common stock based on most recent share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen) and may, subject to certain conditions, acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market.\n- 40 -\nThe Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the Company's Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. The financial performance of AmerisourceBergen, including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation, will impact the Company's results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergen's common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. These considerations may materially and adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nFor more information, see Business - Relationship with AmerisourceBergen\u201d and note 5, equity method investments to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following table presents certain key financial statistics for the Company for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\n\n\n1The Company adopted ASU 2017-07 Topic 715 as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019) on a retrospective basis. The impact on our previously reported net periodic costs as a result of the retrospective adoption of this standard results in a reclassification from selling, general and administrative expenses to other income (expense) of $125 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.\n- 41 -\n2See --Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. For discussion related to the results of operations by segment for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2019.\nFiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nFiscal 2020 net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance decreased 88.5 percent to $456 million, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 88.0 percent to $0.52 compared with the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects third quarter non-cash impairment charges, adverse COVID-19 impacts, lower U.S. pharmacy gross profit, and year on year bonus changes partially offset by savings from Transformational Cost Management Program. Diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year.\nOther income for fiscal 2020 was $70 million compared to $233 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease primarily reflects gains resulting from the termination of the option granted to Rite Aid to become a member of the Company's group purchasing organization in fiscal 2019.\nInterest was a net expense of $639 million and $704 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 48.5% and 13.0%, respectively. The net increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to third quarter non-tax deductible impairment charges and deferred tax impact of the UK rate change.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2020 decreased 24.5 percent to $4.2 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2020 decreased 20.8 percent to $4.74 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both negatively impacted by 0.2 percentage points as a result of currency translation.\nExcluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to COVID-19 adverse impacts, lower U.S. pharmacy gross profit and year on year bonus changes partially offset by savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. See --Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\n- 42 -\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations by segment for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. For discussion related to the results of operations by segment for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2019.\nRetail Pharmacy USA\nThis division comprises the retail pharmacy business operating in the United States.\n\n\n\n1The Company adopted ASU 2017-07 Topic 715 as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019) on a retrospective basis. The impact for Retail Pharmacy USA on our previously reported net periodic costs as a result of the retrospective adoption of this standard results in a reclassification from selling, general and administrative expenses to other income (expense) of $109 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.\n2See --Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\n3Includes immunizations.\n- 43 -\n4Includes the adjustment to convert prescriptions greater than 84 days to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.\n5Comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months. Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable store sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively, in such stores. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods. The twelve months ended August 31, 2020 figures include an adjustment to remove February 29, 2020 results due to the leap year.\nSales fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nThe Retail Pharmacy USA division's sales for fiscal 2020 increased by 3.0% to $107.7 billion. Sales in comparable stores increased by 2.8% in fiscal 2020.\nPharmacy sales increased by 4.3% in fiscal 2020 and represented 74.7% of the division's sales. The increase in fiscal 2020 is due to higher brand inflation and growth in specialty sales. In fiscal 2019, pharmacy sales increased 8.6% and represented 73.8% of the division's sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 3.2% in fiscal 2020 compared to an increase of 4.0% in fiscal 2019. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 2.4% in fiscal 2020 compared to a reduction of 1.2% in fiscal 2019. The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 1.7% in fiscal 2020 compared to a reduction of 0.8% for fiscal 2019. Third-party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.2% of prescription sales for fiscal 2020 compared to 97.1% for fiscal 2019. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2020 was 818.0 million compared to 843.7 million in fiscal 2019. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 1,165.3 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 1,150.1 million in fiscal 2019.\nRetail sales decreased by 0.4% in fiscal 2020 and were 25.3% of the division's sales. In comparison, fiscal 2019 retail sales were flat and comprised 26.2% of the division's sales. Comparable retail sales increased 1.6% in fiscal 2020 and decreased 2.4% in fiscal 2019. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by health & wellness, including a favorable cough cold and flu season and personal care categories partially offset by the continued de-emphasis of tobacco.\nOperating income fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy USA division's operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 34.1% to $2.7 billion. The decrease was primarily due to U.S pharmacy reimbursement pressure and COVID-19 adverse impacts partially offset by a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.\nGross margin was 20.6% in fiscal 2020 compared to 22.5% in fiscal 2019. Gross margin was negatively impacted in fiscal 2020 by pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.1% in fiscal 2020 compared to 18.6% in fiscal 2019. As a percentage of sales, expenses were lower in the current period primarily due to savings related to the Transformational Cost Management Program and gains on sale-leaseback transactions partially offset by costs related to the Company's Transformational Cost Management Program and year-on-year bonus impact.\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy USA division's adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 22.0% to $4.1 billion. The decrease was primarily due to lower pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure, and COVID-19 adverse impacts partially offset by a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.\nSee --Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\n- 44 -\nRetail Pharmacy International\nThis division comprises retail pharmacy businesses operating in countries outside of the United States and in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Euro, Chilean peso and Mexican peso. Therefore, the division's results are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. See item 7A, Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, for further information on currency risk.\n\n\n\n1The Company adopted ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019) on a retrospective basis. The impact for Retail Pharmacy International on our previously reported net periodic costs as a result of the retrospective adoption of this standard results in a reclassification from selling, general and administrative expenses to other income (expense) of $18 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.\n2See --Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\n3Comparable stores in constant currency are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months. Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable store sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency refer to total sales, pharmacy sales and retail sales, respectively, in such stores. The method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency may not be the same as other retailers' methods. The Company presents certain information related to current period operating results in constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Comparable store sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency exclude the effects of\n- 45 -\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See --Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d The twelve months ended August 31, 2020 figures include an adjustment to remove February 29, 2020 results due to the leap year.\nSales fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy International division's sales for fiscal 2020 decreased 12.7% to $10.0 billion. The negative impact of currency translation on sales was 1.6 percentage points. Comparable stores sales in constant currency decreased 10.4 percent mainly due to lower retail sales in Boots UK, driven by a reduction in store foot traffic due to the impact of COVID-19.\nPharmacy sales decreased 4.3% in fiscal 2020 and represented 39.0% of the division's sales. The negative impact of currency translation on pharmacy sales was 2.7 percentage points. Comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency increased 0.3 percent as favorable National Health Service reimbursement levels mitigated the impact of lower prescription volume and reduced demand for services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Boots UK.\nRetail sales decreased 17.4% for fiscal 2020 and represented 61.0% of the division's sales. The negative impact of currency translation on retail sales was 1.0 percentage points. Comparable retail sales in constant currency decreased 17.2 percent reflecting lower Boots UK retail sales, as footfall in stores in the second half of the year was significantly reduced due to COVID-19, particularly in major high street, train station and airport locations.\nOperating income fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy International division's operating loss for fiscal 2020 was $2.1 billion, compared to an operating income of $438 million in fiscal 2019. Operating income was positively impacted by 2.1 percentage points ($9 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in operating income was primarily in the UK, due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the Boots reporting unit and lower gross profit reflecting lower sales from COVID-19 restrictions in Boots UK and Opticians.\nGross profit decreased 17.3% in fiscal 2020. Gross profit was negatively impacted by 1.3 percentage points ($60 million) of currency translation, the remaining decrease was mainly due to lower retail sales in Boots UK and Opticians, higher fulfillment costs and lower supplier contributions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 43.4% from fiscal 2019. Expenses were positively impacted by 1.7 percentage points ($69 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase was almost entirely due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the Boots reporting unit partially offset by short term cost mitigation initiatives. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 58.6% in fiscal 2020, compared to 35.6% in the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nRetail Pharmacy International division's adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 82.6% to $130 million. Adjusted operating income was positively impacted by 1.0 percentage points ($8 million) of currency translation.

The impact for Pharmaceutical Wholesale on our previously reported net periodic costs as a result of the retrospective adoption of this standard results in a reclassification from selling, general and administrative expenses to other income (expense) of $(2) million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.\n2See --Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\n3Comparable sales in constant currency are defined as sales excluding acquisitions and dispositions. The Company presents certain information related to current period operating results in constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Comparable sales in constant currency exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See --Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below.\nSales fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nPharmaceutical Wholesale division's sales for the fiscal 2020 increased 3.9% to $24.0 billion. Sales were negatively impacted by 2.5 percentage points as a result of currency translation. Comparable sales in constant currency increased 6.5% led by growth in the UK and emerging markets.\nOperating income fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nPharmaceutical Wholesale division's operating income for fiscal 2020, was $732 million, including $341 million from the company's equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. This compared with operating income of $471 million in fiscal 2019, including $164 million from the Company's equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. Operating income was negatively impacted by $14 million as a result of currency translation. The increase in operating income was primarily due to costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program in fiscal 2019.\n- 47 -\nGross profit increased 1.1% from the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was negatively impacted by 2.2 percentage points ($44 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in gross profit was primarily due to sales growth, partially offset by lower gross margin.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3.6% from the prior fiscal year. Expenses were positively impacted by 1.8 percentage points ($30 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease was primarily due to costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program in fiscal 2019, partially offset by the impact of sales growth. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.0% in fiscal 2020, compared to 7.5% in fiscal 2019.\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nPharmaceutical Wholesale division's adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020, which included $437 million from the Company's share of adjusted equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen, increased 4.4% to $980 million. Adjusted operating income was negatively impacted by 1.5 percentage points ($14 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted operating income over the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher sales and a higher contribution from AmerisourceBergen, partially offset by lower gross margin and higher adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses. See --Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nThe following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThese supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because the Company's management has evaluated its financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented.\nThe Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the United States reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n- 48 -\n\n\n1Store damage and inventory losses as a result of looting in the U.S., net of insurance recoveries.\n2Excludes impairment of $73 million for indefinite-lived pharmacy licenses intangible asset recorded during the three months ended August 31, 2019, in the Boots reporting unit within the Retail Pharmacy International segment, presented within \"Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\".\n3The Company adopted new accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2017-07 as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019) on a retrospective basis for the Consolidated Statements of Earnings presentation. This change resulted in reclassification of all the other net cost components (excluding service cost component) of net pension cost and net postretirement benefit cost from selling, general and administrative expenses to other income (expense) with no impact on the Company's net earnings.\n- 49 -\n\n- 50 -\n\n1Excludes impairment of $73 million for indefinite-lived pharmacy licenses intangible asset recorded during the three months ended August 31, 2019, in the Boots reporting unit within the Retail Pharmacy International segment, presented within \"Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\".\n2Store damage and inventory losses as a result of looting in the U.S., net of insurance recoveries.\n3Discrete tax-only items.\n4Represents the adjustment to the GAAP basis tax provision commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments.\n5Beginning in the quarter ended May 31, 2019, management reviewed and refined its practice to reflect the proportionate share of certain equity method investees' non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company's non-GAAP measures in order to provide investors with a comparable view of performance across periods. These adjustments include acquisition-related amortization and acquisition-related costs and were immaterial for periods prior to the quarter ended May 31, 2019. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees.\nThe Company considers certain metrics presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as comparable store sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, to be key performance indicators because the Company's management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures, which are described in more detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.\n- 51 -\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash and cash equivalents were $0.5 billion (including $0.2 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2020, compared to $1.0 billion (including $0.4 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2019. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds.\nThe Company's long-term capital policy is to: maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in its core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Company's Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Company's dividend policy to set forth the Company's current intention to increase its dividend each year.\nCash provided by operations and the incurrence of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $5.6 billion in fiscal 2019 and $8.3 billion in fiscal 2018. The $0.1 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities is mainly due to lower cash inflows from net earnings and higher cash outflows from trade accounts payable, partially offset by higher cash inflows from accrued expenses and other liabilities and accounts receivable. Changes in trade accounts payable are mainly driven by timing of collections and payments and working capital initiatives. Changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities are mainly driven by timing of accrual, prior year cash payments for certain legal and regulatory settlements, and working capital initiatives. Changes in accounts receivable are mainly driven by timing of collections and payments.\nNet cash used for investing activities was $1.3 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2019 and $5.5 billion in fiscal 2018. Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2020 were $0.7 billion compared to $0.7 billion in fiscal 2019 and $4.8 billion in fiscal 2018. Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2018 include the acquisition of Rite Aid assets and the investment in GuoDa. Additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2020 were $1.4 billion compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2019 and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures by reporting segment were as follows (in millions):\n\nSignificant capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in our stores and information technology projects.\nNet cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2020 was $4.6 billion compared to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2019 and $5.3 billion in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2020 there were $20.4 billion in net proceeds compared to $12.4 billion in fiscal 2019 and $5.9 billion in fiscal 2018 primarily from revolving facilities described below and commercial paper debt.

Cash dividends paid were $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2019 and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2018.\nThe Company expects to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations from liquidity sources including cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities, commercial paper programs, working capital financing arrangements and current cash and investment balances. The Company believes that these sources, and the ability to obtain other financing will provide adequate cash funds for the Company's foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. The Company's cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. Additionally, the Company's cash requirements, and its ability to generate cash flow, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 and the resulting market volatility and instability.\n- 52 -\nAs described in more detail below, during the second half of fiscal 2020, the Company took actions intended to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of COVID-19 and uncertainty in the global markets, including issuing $1.0 billion of 4.10% notes due 2050 and $0.5 billion of 3.20% notes due 2030. Additionally, the Company entered into several new credit facilities totaling $3.6 billion, increasing its total undrawn committed credit facilities to $11.5 billion as of August 31, 2020.

These commercial paper notes are guaranteed by the Company. This subsidiary has been approved as an eligible issuer under the Joint HM Treasury and Bank of England's COVID Corporate Financing Facility commercial paper program. For further information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the Company, including on its liquidity and capital resources, please see item 1A, risk factors in this report.\nSee item 3, qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk, below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.\nStock repurchase program\nIn June 2018, the Company authorized a stock repurchase program (the June 2018 stock repurchase program\u201d), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Company's common stock of which the Company had repurchased $8.0 billion as of August 31, 2020. The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date. In July 2020, the Company announced that it is suspending activities under this program. The Company may continue to repurchase stock to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans.\nThe Company purchased 30 million and 57 million shares under stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2020 and 2019 at a cost of $1.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment.

Borrowings under the August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, the alternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on the Company's credit ratings. As of August 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOn November 30, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto on March 25, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to such credit agreement (such credit agreement, as so amended the November 2018 Credit Agreement\u201d) reflecting certain changes to the borrowing notice provisions thereto and on April 2, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the November 2018 Credit Agreement (such credit agreement as so further amended, the Amended November 2018 Credit Agreement\u201d), which second amendment became effective as of May 29, 2020.

On July 27, 2020, the December 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement matured and the Company paid all amounts due in connection therewith.\nOn January 18, 2019, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement (as extended, the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) with the lenders from time to time party thereto. The January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement is a senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility, with a facility termination date of the earlier of (a) 364 days following January 31, 2019, the date of the effectiveness of the commitments pursuant to the January 364- Day Revolving Credit Agreement, subject to extension thereof pursuant to the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate amount of the commitments pursuant to the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement. On December 18, 2019, the Company entered into an Extension Agreement (the Extension Agreement\u201d) relating to the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto and Mizuho, as administrative agent. The Extension Agreement extends the Maturity Date (as defined in the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement) for an additional period of 364 days to January 28, 2021. Such extension became effective on January 30, 2020. Borrowings under the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, the alternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on the Company's credit ratings. As of August 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the January 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOn August 30, 2019, the Company entered into three $500 million revolving credit agreements (together, the August 2019 Revolving Credit Agreements\u201d and each individually, an August 2019 Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) with the lenders from time to time party thereto.

There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. The Company's credit ratings impact its borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Company's debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nAmerisourceBergen relationship\nAs of August 31, 2020, the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 28% of the outstanding common stock based on most recent share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergen's board of directors. As of August 31, 2020, the Company can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergen's board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. Subject to applicable legal and contractual requirements, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to\n- 55 -\ninstruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1. See note 5, equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe information set forth in note 10, commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. The Company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:\nBusiness combinations - The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.\nFor intangible assets, the Company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.\nJudgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.\nLeases - The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. The lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. The commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the Company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nThe lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there is significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the Company's economic and strategic initiatives. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.\nThe Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. These are expensed as incurred. The Company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that\n- 56 -\nincludes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.\nFinance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Company's impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.\nDuring the three months ended May 31, 2020, the Company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets related to its two reporting units within Retail Pharmacy International division, Boots and Other international, as a result of the significant impact of COVID-19 on their financial performance. Based on this analysis, the Company recorded impairment charges of $1.7 billion on Boots goodwill and $0.3 billion on certain indefinite-lived Boots tradename assets.\nBased on the annual evaluation as of June 1, 2020 valuation date, the fair values of the Company's reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4% to approximately 239% excluding Boots reporting unit for which the excess of fair value over carrying amount was nominal due to an impairment charge recognized during the three months ended May 31, 2020. Other international reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 4% compared to 16% on June 1, 2019. As of August 31, 2020, the carrying values of goodwill were $1.1 billion and $0.5 billion for Boots reporting unit and Other international reporting unit, respectively. The fair values of certain indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4% to approximately 31%, excluding certain indefinite-lived Boots tradename assets for which the excess of fair values over carrying amounts were nominal due to impairment charges recognized during the three months ended May 31, 2020. As of August 31, 2020, the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit was $7.2 billion. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment of $73 million on its pharmacy licenses in the Boots reporting unit.\nThe determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions including the business and financial performance of the Company's reporting units, as well as how such performance may be impacted by COVID-19. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures, including considering the impact of COVID-19.\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, including the impact of COVID-19, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability. The Company will continue to monitor these potential impacts, including the impact of COVID-19 and economic, industry and market trends and the impact these may have on Boots and Other international reporting units.\nThe Company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the Company's fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company's equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.\n- 57 -\nSee note 6, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nImpairment of long lived assets - The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Long-lived assets related to the Company's retail operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. Fair value of the asset group is generally determined using income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.\nThe determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.\nCost of sales and inventory - Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.\nCost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) method for the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and primarily on a first-in first-out ( FIFO\u201d) basis for inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments.\nEquity method investments - The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Company's ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.\nThe Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.\nPension and postretirement benefits - The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.\nIn determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the Company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $438.8 million to the Company's pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the Company's pension expense by $23.7 million.\nThe Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.\nIncome taxes -The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of\n- 58 -\nlimitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nIn determining its provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the United States. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nThe following table lists the Company's contractual obligations and commitments at August 31, 2020 (in millions):\n\n* Not recorded on balance sheet.\n** Excluding debt discounts and issuance costs and finance lease obligations.\n1Amounts do not include certain operating expenses under these leases such as common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes and rental payments based on sales volume, where appropriate.

(the Company, we, us, our), including statements about goals for future performance, business strategies, expected financial results, cost-cutting initiatives, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other factors potentially affecting operations and earnings. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed. Factors contributing to these differences include, but are not limited to, COVID-19's impact, changes in prescription drug prices, pharmacy reimbursement and healthcare regulations, and other market and economic conditions.\n\nFor fiscal year 2020, the Company experienced a significant impact from COVID-19, including store closures, reduced foot traffic, and changes in spending towards essential items with lower margins. Despite this, pharmacy volume improved in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. To manage through the pandemic, the Company increased liquidity by issuing $1.5 billion in debt securities and establishing new credit facilities, while also suspending its stock repurchase program.\n\nMoreover, the spread and impact of COVID-19 created significant volatility and economic disruption, which affected customer behavior and sales, particularly within the Retail Pharmacy International division. The division reported a substantial decline in sales, primarily in Boots UK stores due to government restrictions. Foot traffic, however, showed improvement by the fourth quarter. As a response, the Company took measures such as introducing 'order ahead' drive-thru, new delivery options, and testing programs for COVID-19 to adapt to the pandemic.\n\nThe Company took significant impairment charges related to goodwill and certain intangible assets in the Retail Pharmacy International division, specifically in Boots UK, due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 on financial performance.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company generated $5.5 billion in cash from operations and invested $1.3 billion in capital expenditures. Despite market disruptions, management believes that existing liquidity sources, including operating cash flow and existing credit facilities, will be adequate to meet foreseeable needs for working capital, dividend payments, capital expenditures, and debt service obligations for the subsequent twelve months.\n\nThroughout the report, the Company emphasizes the importance of careful judgment and estimates in preparing financial statements. Estimates are based on various assumptions, some of which may be affected by changes in the market, competition, and legal or regulatory developments. Adjustments to estimates could materially affect future financial results.\n\nThe report concludes with a cautionary note that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and should be considered in the context of various uncertainties, including but not limited to the impact of COVID-19, economic conditions, and changes in laws and regulations. Management may adjust its strategies in response to changing conditions, and deviations from current expectations may require adjustments to financial statements in future periods."}
