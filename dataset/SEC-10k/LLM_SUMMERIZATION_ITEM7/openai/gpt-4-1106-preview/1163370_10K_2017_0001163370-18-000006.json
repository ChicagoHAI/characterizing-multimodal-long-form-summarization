MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion highlights key information as determined by management but may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding, the following should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 included elsewhere in this report.\nThis annual report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nExecutive Overview\nNet income attributable to the Company decreased 9% to $13.2 million or $1.88 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $14.4 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the SEC's definition.\nAllowance for loan losses: The Company maintains an Allowance to reflect inherent losses in its loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company performs regular credit reviews of the loan portfolio to determine the credit quality and adherence to underwriting standards. When loans are originated, they are assigned a risk rating that is reassessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process. The Company's risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from 1 to 10, where a higher rating represents higher risk. These risk ratings are then consolidated into five classes, which include pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. These classes are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan losses. Each class is assessed an inherent credit loss factor that determines an amount of allowance for loan losses provided for that group of loans. This allowance is then adjusted for qualitative factors, by segment and class. Qualitative factors are based on management's assessment of current trends that may cause losses inherent in the current loan portfolio to differ significantly from historical losses. Some factors that management considers in determining the qualitative adjustment to the general reserve include loan quality trends in our own portfolio, the degree of concentrations of large borrowers in our loan portfolio, national and local economic trends, business conditions, underwriting policies and standards, trends in local real estate markets, effects of various political activities, peer group data, and internal factors such as underwriting policies and expertise of the Company's employees.\nRegular credit reviews of the portfolio also identify loans that are considered potentially impaired. A loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events, we determine that we will probably not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract, including scheduled interest payments. When we identify a loan as impaired, we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows, except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral. In these cases, we use the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, instead of discounted cash flows. The analysis of collateral dependent loans includes appraisals on loans secured by real property, management's assessment of the current market, recent payment history and an evaluation of other sources of repayment. The Company obtains appraisals on real and personal property that secure its loans during the loan origination process in accordance with regulatory guidance and its loan policy. The Company obtains updated appraisals on loans secured by real or personal property based upon its assessment of changes in the current market or particular projects or properties, information from other current appraisals and other sources of information. The Company uses the information provided in these updated appraisals along with its evaluation of all other information available on a particular property as it assesses the collateral coverage on its performing and nonperforming loans and the impact that may have on the adequacy of its Allowance.\nIf we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we either recognize an impairment reserve as a specific component to be provided for in the Allowance or charge-off the impaired balance on collateral dependent loans if it is determined that such amount represents a confirmed loss. The combination of the risk rating-based allowance component and the impairment reserve allowance component lead to an allocated allowance for loan losses.\nFinally, the Company assesses the overall adequacy of the Allowance based on several factors including the level of the Allowance as compared to total loans and nonperforming loans in light of current economic conditions. This portion of the Allowance is deemed unallocated\u201d because it is not allocated to any segment or class of the loan portfolio. This portion of the Allowance provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the credit loss factors that are utilized in the risk rating-based component or in the specific impairment component of the Allowance and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models.\nThe unallocated portion of the Allowance is based upon management's evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the allocated portions of the Allowance. Such factors include uncertainties in identifying triggering events that directly correlate to subsequent loss rates, uncertainties in economic conditions, risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors, and historical loss experience data that may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio. In addition, the unallocated reserve may fluctuate based upon the direction of various risk indicators. Examples of such factors include the risk as to current and prospective economic conditions, the level and trend of charge offs or recoveries, and the risk of heightened imprecision or inconsistency of appraisals used in estimating real estate values. Although this allocation process may not accurately predict credit losses by loan type or in aggregate, the total allowance for credit losses is available to absorb losses that may arise from any loan type or category. Due to the subjectivity involved in the determination of the unallocated portion of the Allowance, the relationship of the unallocated component to the total Allowance may fluctuate from period to period.\nBased on our methodology and its components, management believes the resulting Allowance is adequate and appropriate for the risk identified in the Company's loan portfolio. Given current processes employed by the Company, management believes the segments, classes, and estimated loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be material to the Company's financial statements. In addition, current loan classes and fair value estimates of collateral are subject to change as we continue to review loans within our portfolio and as our borrowers are impacted by economic trends within their market areas. Although we have established an Allowance that we consider adequate, there can be no assurance that the established Allowance will be sufficient to offset losses on loans in the future. In addition, a substantial percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate; as a result, a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the Allowance.\nValuation of goodwill and other intangibles: Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment. Management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis as of December 31. Additionally, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists. The impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures, technology, changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions. There can be no assurance that changes in circumstances, estimates or assumptions may result in additional impairment of all, or some portion of, goodwill or other intangible assets. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing at December 31, 2017 and 2016 in accordance with the policy described in Note 1 to the financial statements included with this report. At December 31, 2017, the Company performed its annual impairment test by performing the first step of the comprehensive impairment analysis. The Company estimated the fair value of the Company using four valuation methodologies including a comparable transactions approach, a control premium approach, a public market peers approach and a discounted cash flow approach. We then compared the estimated fair value of the Company to the carrying value and concluded that no potential impairment existed as of December 31, 2017.\nValuation of OREO: OREO represents properties acquired through foreclosure or its equivalent. Prior to foreclosure, the carrying value is adjusted to the fair value, less cost to sell, of the real estate to be acquired by an adjustment to the allowance for loan loss. The amount by which the fair value less cost to sell is greater than the carrying amount of the loan plus amounts previously charged off is recognized in earnings. Any subsequent reduction in the carrying value is charged against earnings. Management's evaluation of fair value is based on appraisals or discounted cash flows of anticipated sales. The amounts ultimately recovered from the sale of OREO may differ from the carrying value of the assets because of market factors beyond the Company's control or due to changes in the Company's strategies for recovering the investment.\nMortgage servicing rights: The Company measures mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\") at fair value on a recurring basis and reports changes in fair value through earnings in mortgage banking income in the period in which the change occurs. Fair value adjustments encompass market-driven valuation changes and the decrease in value that occurs from the passage of time, which are separately reported. Retained MSRs are measured at fair value as of the date of sale. Initial and subsequent fair value measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model. In order to determine the fair value of the MSR, the present value of expected net future cash flows is estimated. Assumptions used include market discount rates, anticipated prepayment speeds, escrow calculations, delinquency rates and ancillary fee income net of servicing costs. The model assumptions are also compared to publicly filed information from several large MSR holders, as available.\nFair Value: A hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability is utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Pricing observability is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIncome Statement\nNet Income\nOur results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income. We also generate other income primarily through mortgage banking income, purchased receivables products, sales of employee benefit plans (through August of 2017, when we sold the assets of NBG), service charges and fees, bankcard fees and rental income. Our operating expenses consist in large part of salaries and other personnel costs, occupancy, data processing, marketing, and professional services expenses and compensation expense for RML acquisition payments. Interest income and cost of funds, or interest expense, are affected significantly by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, by government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities and by competition in our markets.\nWe earned net income attributable to the Company of $13.2 million in 2017, compared to net income of $14.4 million in 2016, and $17.8 million in 2015. During these periods, net income per diluted share was $1.88, $2.06, and $2.56, respectively. The decrease in net income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase of $4.3 million in provision for income taxes and an increase of $902,000 in the provision for loan losses, as well as a decrease of $2.8 million in other operating income, which was primarily driven by a reduction in mortgage banking income. These changes were only partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in net interest income and a $4.6 million decrease in compensation expense - RML acquisition payments in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in net income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $2.9 million in salaries and other personnel expense and an increase of $554,000 in the provision for loan losses, as well as decreases of $1.3 million and $552,000 in other operating income and net interest income, respectively, in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nNet Interest Income / Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income from loan and investment securities portfolios and interest expense on customer deposits and borrowings. Net interest income in 2017 was $57.7 million, compared to $56.4 million in 2016, and $56.9 million in 2015. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was mainly due to increased interest income earned on long- and short-term investments and loans primarily due to higher yields in 2017 compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to decreased interest income earned on loans and loans held for sale mainly due to lower yields, which was only partially offset by increased interest income on long-term investments due to higher balances.\nChanges in net interest income result from changes in volume and spread, which in turn affect our margin. For this purpose, volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Changes in net interest income are influenced by yields and the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, net interest margins were 4.22%, 4.14%, and 4.27%, respectively. The increase in the net interest margin in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily the result of higher yields on all interest-earning assets. The decrease in net interest margin in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily the result of lower yields on portfolio loans as well as an unfavorable change in the mix of interest-earning assets as average portfolio loans decreased as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. The Company intends to continue to implement strategies designed to grow our loan portfolio, while actively managing non-performing assets, to offset the negative effect that today's relatively low interest rates have on our net interest margin.\nThe following table sets forth for the periods indicated information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities, as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields or costs, net interest income, and net interest margin are also presented:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The loan loss provision increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in nonperforming loans and an increase in the portion of the Allowance specific to impaired loans in 2017 compared to 2016. The loan loss provision increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in nonperforming loans as well as increases in qualitative factors mostly due to softening in the Alaskan economy in 2016 compared to 2015.

Mortgage banking income, which is the largest component of other operating income and represented 58% of total other operating income in 2017 and consists of gross income from the origination and sale of mortgages as well as mortgage loan servicing fees, decreased to $23.3 million in 2017 from $29.5 million in 2016, mainly due to lower mortgage production revenue resulting from lower realized gains on the sale of mortgage loans, which was partially offset by increased mortgage servicing revenue. The overall decline in mortgage banking income is primarily the result of the slowing of the Alaskan economy. Employee benefit plan income decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the sale of the assets of NBG in August 2017. Lastly, purchased receivable income increased mostly due to higher yields and balances in 2017 compared to 2016 and service charges on deposit accounts decreased primarily due to lower non-sufficient funds fees.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nThe most significant changes in other operating income in 2016 were a decrease in gains on the disposition of loans acquired in the APB transaction at a discount to par values and in gains on the sale of investment securities. Mortgage banking income, which is the largest component of other operating income and represented 68% of total other operating income in 2016 and consists of gross income from the origination and sale of mortgages as well as mortgage loan servicing fees, decreased slightly to $29.5 million in 2016 from $29.6 million in 2015 mainly due to lower mortgage production revenue resulting from lower realized gains on the sale of mortgage loans and the change in fair value of mortgage loan commitments, which was mostly offset by increased mortgage servicing revenue. Service charges on deposit accounts also decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 in part due to lower non-sufficient funds fees. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in employee benefit plan income mostly due to growth in NBG's core business operations, higher other loan fees due to increased commercial loan servicing revenue, and higher purchased receivable income mostly due to higher yields in 2016 compared to 2015 .\nOther Operating Expense\nThe following table details the major components of other operating expense for the years ended December 31:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Operating Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and other personnel expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$44,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($2,031\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$46,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$43,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy expense\n</td> <td>6,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>6,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>6,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing expense\n</td> <td>5,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>4,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>4,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing expense\n</td> <td>2,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(279\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>2,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional and outside services\n</td> <td>2,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>2,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(183\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>2,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance expense\n</td> <td>1,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>1,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>1,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation expense -

RML acquisition payments and salaries and other personnel expense, and, to a lesser extent, professional and outside services expense and loss on sale of premises and equipment. Compensation expense - RML acquisition payments decreased $4.6 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 due in part to the fact that 2016 included a $2.3 million non-cash error correction that covered the period from December 1, 2014, through June 30, 2016. The remainder of the decrease in compensation expense - RML acquisition payments resulted from a decrease in net income from RML. Salaries and other personnel expense decreased primarily due to lower originator commission expense in the home mortgage lending segment due to lower home mortgage loan originations. These decreases were partially offset by increases in impairment on OREO expense and data processing expense in 2017 compared to 2016. Impairment on OREO increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to writedowns on two OREO properties resulting from a decrease in sales price assumptions. Data processing expense increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 mostly due to higher software amortization and maintenance expense.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nOther operating expense increased in 2016 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased costs in salaries and other personnel expense and compensation expense - RML acquisition payments, and, to a lesser extent, data processing expense, occupancy expense and professional and outside services. Salaries and other personnel expenses increased on an approximately equal basis in both the community banking segment and home mortgage lending segment in 2016. Salaries and other personnel expense related to the operations of the community banking segment increased $1.4 million mainly due to higher medical costs and increases in various other benefits costs, as well as normal cost of living and performance based annual salary increases. The home mortgage lending segment had an increase in salaries and other personnel expense primarily attributable to an increase in full-time equivalent employees for new management and marketing positions and the addition of a new location in Wasilla. While compensation expense - RML acquisition payments increased $681,000 in 2016 as compared to 2015. This expense item in 2016 included a $2.3 million non-cash error correction that covered the period from December 1, 2014, through June 30, 2016. Additionally, the change in the accounting treatment of these payments also increased compensation expense - RML acquisition payments in the third and fourth quarters of 2016. The total increase in compensation expense - RML acquisition payments in 2016 resulting from the error correction and prospective change in accounting was $3.0 million. These increases were partially offset by slight decreases in insurance expense and marketing expense in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes increased $4.3 million or 71%, to $10.3 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 and decreased $2.7 million or 31%, to $6.1 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 includes $2.7 million in expense for the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset resulting from a decrease in the corporate tax rate included in federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017. Additionally, the changes in total income tax expense for these periods are due primarily to the 13% increase in income before income taxes in 2017 compared to the previous year and a 22% decrease in income before income taxes in 2016 compared to 2015. Additionally, the Company's effective tax rates were 43%, 29%, and 32% in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 is mainly due to the increase in expense resulting from the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset. The decrease in effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 is mainly due to higher tax credits and tax-exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax income in 2016 as compared to 2015. The Company believes its effective tax rate will decline to between 19% and 20% due to the new federal tax legislation in 2018.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nInvestment Securities\nThe composition of our investment securities portfolio reflects management's investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of interest income. The investment securities portfolio also mitigates interest rate and credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio, while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, a source of liquidity (by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreements), and collateral for certain public funds deposits. Investment securities designated as available for sale comprised 100% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and are available to meet liquidity requirements.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of government sponsored entity securities, corporate securities, and municipal securities. Investment securities at December 31, 2017 decreased $19.4 million, or 6%, to $312.8 million from $332.1 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016 is primarily due to a portion of the proceeds from sales, maturities, and security calls being held in short-term investment funds at December 31, 2017. The average maturity of the investment portfolio was approximately two years at December 31, 2017.\nInvestment securities may be pledged as collateral to secure public deposits or borrowings. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $51.6 million and $50.9 million in securities were pledged for deposits and borrowings, respectively.

in preferred stock does not have a maturity date but it has been included in the over 10 years column above. At December 31, 2017, we held no securities of any single issuer (other than government sponsored entities) that exceeded 10% of our shareholders' equity.\nLoans\nOur loan products include short and medium-term commercial loans, commercial credit lines, construction and real estate loans, and consumer loans. To a lesser extent, through our wholly-owned subsidiary RML, we also originate mortgage loans which we sell to the secondary market. We also retain servicing rights on mortgage loans originated by RML and sold to the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (\"AHFC\"). We emphasize providing financial services to small and medium-sized businesses and to individuals. From our inception, we have emphasized commercial, land development and home construction, and commercial real estate lending. These types of lending have provided us with needed market opportunities and generally provide higher net interest margins compared to other types of lending such as consumer lending. However, they also involve greater risks, including greater exposure to changes in local economic conditions.\nAll of our loans and credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations. These limitations apply to the borrower's total outstanding indebtedness and commitments to us, including the indebtedness of any guarantor. Generally, we are permitted to make loans to one borrower of up to 15% of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the Bank. The loan-to-one-borrower limitation for the Bank was $27.5 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, the Company had two relationships whose total direct and indirect commitments exceeded $27.5 million; however, no individual direct relationship exceeded the loans-to-one borrower limitation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Provision for Loan Losses\u201d for further discussion of the Company's concentration of loans to large borrowers.\nOur lending operations are guided by loan policies, which outline the basic policies and procedures by which lending operations are conducted. Generally, the policies address our desired loan types, target markets, underwriting and collateral requirements, terms, interest rate and yield considerations, and compliance with laws and regulations. The policies are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors of the Bank. Our Quality Assurance Department provides a detailed financial analysis of our largest, most complex loans. In addition, the Quality Assurance Department, along with the Senior Credit Officer of the Bank and others in the Loan Administration department, have developed processes to analyze and manage various\nconcentrations of credit within the overall loan portfolio. The Loan Administration Department monitors the procedures and processes for both the analysis and reporting of problem loans, and also develops strategies to resolve problem loans based on the facts and circumstances for each loan. Finally, our Internal Audit Department also performs an independent review of each loan portfolio for compliance with loan policy as well as a review of credit quality. The Internal Audit review follows the FDIC sampling guidelines, and a review of each portfolio is performed on an annual basis.\nThe Company acquired $138.4 million in loans in connection with the acquisition of APB on April 1, 2014.

Short-term working capital loans generally are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, or equipment. We also make longer-term commercial loans secured by equipment and real estate. We also make commercial loans that are guaranteed in large part by the Small Business Administration or the Bureau of Indian Affairs and to a lesser extent guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture, as well as commercial real estate loans that are purchased by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority ( AIDEA\u201d). Commercial loans increased to $313.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $278.2 million at December 31, 2016 and represented approximately 33% and 29% of our total loans outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Commercial loans reprice more frequently than other types of loans, such as real estate loans. More frequent repricing means that interest cash flows from commercial loans are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, our philosophy is to emphasize the pricing of loans on a floating rate basis, which allows these loans to reprice more frequently and to contribute positively to our net interest margin.\nCommercial Real Estate: We are an active lender in the commercial real estate market. At December 31, 2017, commercial real estate loans decreased to $492.0 million from $554.2 million at December 31, 2016, and represented approximately 51% and 57% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. These loans are typically secured by office buildings, apartment complexes or warehouses. Loan amortization periods range from 10 to 25 years and generally have a maximum maturity of 10 years.\nWe may sell all or a portion of a commercial real estate loan to two State of Alaska entities, AIDEA and AHFC, which were both established to provide long-term financing in the State of Alaska. The loans that AIDEA purchases typically feature a maturity twice that of the loans retained by us and bear a lower interest rate. The blend of our and AIDEA's loan terms allows us to provide competitive long-term financing to our customers, while reducing the risk inherent in this type of lending. We also originate and sell to AHFC loans secured by multifamily residential units. Typically, 100% of these loans are sold to AHFC and we provide ongoing servicing of the loans for a fee. AIDEA and AHFC make it possible for us to originate these commercial real estate loans and enhance fee income while reducing our exposure to interest rate risk.\nConstruction Loans: We provide construction lending for commercial real estate projects. Such loans generally are made only when the Company has also committed to finance the completed project with a commercial real estate loan, or if there is a firm take-out commitment upon completion of the project by a third party lender. Additionally, we provide land development and residential subdivision construction loans. We also originate one-to-four-family residential and condominium construction loans to builders for construction of homes. The Company's construction loans increased in 2017 to $111.3 million, up from $98.2\nmillion in 2016, and represented approximately 12% and 10% of our loan portfolio in December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $30.5 million or 27%, of the Company's construction loans were for low income housing tax credit projects as compared to $31.7 million or 32% as of December 31, 2016.\nConsumer Loans: We provide personal loans for automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats, and other larger consumer purchases. We provide both secured and unsecured consumer credit lines to accommodate the needs of our individual customers, with home equity lines of credit serving as the major product in this area.\nLoans Directly Exposed to the Oil and Gas Industry: The Company defines \"direct exposure\" to the oil and gas industry as companies that it has identified as significantly reliant upon activity related to the oil and gas industry, such as oil producers or drilling and exploration companies, and companies who provide oilfield services, lodging, equipment rental, transportation, and other logistic services specific to the industry. The Company estimates that $70.8 million, or approximately 7% of loans as of December 31, 2017 have direct exposure to the oil and gas industry as compared to $57.4 million, or approximately 6% of loans as of December 31, 2016. The Company has no loans to oil producers or drilling and exploration companies as of the end of 2017 or 2016, but the $70.8 million outstanding as of December 31, 2017 noted above does include $9.2 million related to the construction of an oil rig. The Company's unfunded commitments to borrowers that have direct exposure to the oil and gas industry were $53.5 million and $52.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The portion of the Company's allowance for loan losses that related to the loans with direct exposure to the oil and gas industry was estimated at $1.8 million and $1.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following table details loan balances by loan segment asset quality rating (\"AQR\") and class of financing receivable for loans with direct oil and gas exposure as of the

December 31, 2017, 62% of the portfolio was scheduled to mature or reprice in 2018 with 36% scheduled to mature or reprice between 2019 and 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 70% of commercial loans are variable rate loans, of which 70% reprice within one year. The majority of these loans reprice to an index based upon the prime rate of interest or the respective Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the \"Boston FHLB\") rate. The Company also uses floors in its commercial loan pricing as loans are originated or renewed during the year.\nAt December 31, 2017, the interest rates for approximately 89% of commercial real estate loans are variable, of which 51% reset within one year. Approximately 45% of commercial real estate variable rate loans reprice in greater than one year but within three years. The indices for these loans include the prime rate of interest or the respective Treasury or Boston FHLB rate. The Company also uses floors in its commercial real estate loan pricing as loans are originated or renewed during the year.\nLoans Held for Sale and Mortgage Servicing Rights: The Company originates residential mortgage loans and sells them in the secondary market through our wholly-owned subsidiary, RML. All residential mortgage loans originated and sold in 2017 and 2016 were newly originated loans that did not affect nonperforming loans. The Company also has a mortgage servicing portfolio which is comprised of 1-4 family loans serviced for FHLMC and AHFC. The Company retains servicing rights on all mortgage loans originated by RML and sold to AHFC. Mortgages originated by RML and sold to AHFC represent approximately 26% and 20% of the mortgages originated by RML in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Mortgage servicing rights are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in mortgage banking income. The value of mortgage servicing rights is impacted by market rates for mortgage loans primarily due to how changes in interest rates affect prepayments of mortgage loans. To the extent loans are prepaid sooner than estimated at the time servicing assets are originally recorded, it is possible that certain residential mortgage servicing rights assets may decrease in value. Generally, the fair value of our residential mortgage servicing rights are expected to increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall.\nCredit Quality and Nonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, accruing loans that are 90 days or more past due, repossessed assets and OREO.

This increase was primarily due to the addition of two borrowing relationships to nonaccrual status in 2017. There was interest income of $142,000, $181,000, and $617,000 recognized in net income for 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively, related to interest collected on nonaccrual loans whose principal has been paid down to zero. The Company had three relationships that represented more than 10% of nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company had $7.7 million and $6.1 million in loans classified as troubled debt restructuring loans (\"TDRs\") that were performing as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additionally, there were $16.2 million and $10.1 million in TDRs included in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016 for total TDRs of $23.8 million and $16.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in TDRs at December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to several additions to loans classified as TDRs that were only partially offset by paydowns on TDRs in 2017. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of TDRs.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $30.5 million in loans measured for impairment, net of government guarantees as compared to $37.0 million in loans measured for impairment, net of government guarantees at December 31, 2016. The decrease of $6.5 million is mostly attributable to the transfer of one large borrowing relationship from loans to OREO. The total amount of loans measured for impairment for this borrower was $5.9 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, management had identified potential problem loans of $9.5 million as compared to potential problem loans of $18.2 million at December 31, 2016. Potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing that have developed negative indications that the borrower may not be able to comply with present payment terms and which may later be included in nonaccrual, past due, or impaired loans. The $8.7 million decrease in potential problem loans at December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 was primarily due to one $11.4 million relationship that was upgraded and a $4.6 million relationship which moved to OREO. These decreases were partially offset by the addition of one $6.3 million relationship.\nThe following summarizes OREO activity for the periods indicated:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transfers from loans\n</td> <td>5,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment in other real estate owned\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the sale of other real estate owned\n</td> <td>(3,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(934\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2,733\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of other real estate owned, net\n</td> <td>371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred gain on sale of other real estate owned\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment on other real estate owned\n</td> <td>(904\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(361\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016 the Company held $8.7 million and $6.6 million, respectively, of OREO assets. At December 31, 2017, OREO consists of $3.0 million in residential lots in various stages of development and a $5.7 million commercial building. All OREO property is located in Alaska. The Bank initiates foreclosure proceedings to recover and sell collateral pledged by a debtor to secure a loan based on various events of default and circumstances related to loans that are secured by either commercial or residential real property. These events and circumstances include delinquencies, the Company's relationship with the borrower, and the borrower's ability to repay the loan via a source other than the collateral. If the loan has not yet matured, the debtors may cure the events of default up to the time of sale to retain their interest in the collateral. Failure to cure the defaults will result in the debtor losing ownership interest in the property, which is taken by the creditor, or high bidder at a foreclosure sale.\nDuring 2017, additions to OREO totaled $5.9 million which included a $5.7 million commercial building and a $167,000 single-family residence. During 2017, the Company received approximately $3.3 million in proceeds from the sale of OREO which included $672,000 from the sale of multi-family residential units, $1.4 million from the sale of lots and land, $832,000 from the sale of single-family residences, $360,000 from the sale of a commercial building, and $33,000 from recovery of guarantees on previously disposed OREO properties. The Company recognized $391,000, $295,000, and $284,000 in gains and $19,000, $0, and $0 in losses on the sale of OREO properties in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nThe Company also recognized $0, $0, and $34,000 in gains on sales previously deferred resulting in net gains of $371,000, $295,000, and $315,000 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company had remaining accumulated deferred gains on the sale of OREO properties of $262,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company did not make any loans to facilitate the sale of OREO in 2017, 2016, or 2015. Our underwriting policies and procedures for loans to facilitate the sale of OREO are no different than our standard loan policies and procedures.\nThe Company recognized impairments of $904,000, $187,000 and $361,000 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, due to adjustments to the Company's estimate of the fair value of certain properties based on changes in estimated costs to complete the projects, decrease in expected sales prices, and changes in the Anchorage, Fairbanks, and the Southeastern Alaska real estate markets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains an Allowance to reflect management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and loan recoveries and decreased by loan charge-offs. The size of the Allowance is determined through quarterly assessments of probable estimated losses in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for making such assessments and determining the adequacy of the Allowance includes the following key elements:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A specific allocation for impaired loans. Management determines the fair value of the majority of these loans based on the underlying collateral values. This analysis is based upon a specific analysis for each impaired loan, including external appraisals on loans secured by real property, management's assessment of the current market, recent payment history, and an evaluation of other sources of repayment. In-house evaluations of fair value are used in the impairment analysis in some situations. Inputs to the in-house evaluation process include information about sales of comparable properties in the appropriate markets and changes in tax assessed values. The Company obtains appraisals on real and personal property that secure its loans during the loan origination process in accordance with regulatory guidance and its loan policy. The Company obtains updated appraisals on loans secured by real or personal property based upon its assessment of changes in the current market or particular projects or properties, information from other current appraisals, and other sources of information. Appraisals may be adjusted downward by the Company based on its evaluation of the facts and circumstances on a case by case basis. External appraisals may be discounted when management believes that the absorption period used in the appraisal is unrealistic, when expected liquidation costs exceed those included in the appraisal, or when management's evaluation of deteriorating market conditions warrants an adjustment. Additionally, the Company may also adjust appraisals in the above circumstances between appraisal dates. The Company uses the information provided in these updated appraisals along with its evaluation of all other information available on a particular property as it assesses the collateral coverage on its performing and nonperforming loans and the impact that may have on the adequacy of its Allowance. The specific allowance for impaired loans, as well as the overall Allowance, may increase based on the Company's assessment of updated appraisals. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the Company's estimation of impaired loans measured at fair value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> When the Company determines that a loss has occurred on an impaired loan, a charge-off equal to the difference between carrying value and fair value is recorded. If a specific allowance is deemed necessary for a loan, and then that loan is partially charged off, the loan remains classified as a nonperforming loan after the charge-off is recognized.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A general allocation - The Company has identified segments and classes of loans not considered impaired for purposes of establishing the general allocation allowance. The Company disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments and classes based on its assessment of how different pools of loans with like characteristics in the portfolio behave over time. This determination is based on historical experience and management's assessment of how current facts and circumstances are expected to affect the loan portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Company first disaggregates the loan portfolio into the following eight segments: commercial, real estate construction one-to-four family, real estate construction other, real estate term owner occupied, real estate term non-owner occupied, real estate term other, consumer secured by 1st deeds of trust, and other consumer loans.\nAfter division of the loan portfolio into segments, the Company then further disaggregates each of the segments into classes. The Company has a total of five classes, which are based off of the Company's loan risk grading system known as the Asset Quality Rating ( AQR\u201d) system. The risk ratings are discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. There are five loan classes: pass (pass AQR grades, which\nare grades 1 - 6), special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. There have been no changes to these loan classes in 2017.\nAfter the portfolio has been disaggregated into segments and classes, the Company calculates a general reserve for each segment and class based on the average loss history for each segment and class. The Company utilizes a look-back period of five years in the calculation of average historical loss rates.\nAfter the Company calculates a general allocation using our loss history, the general reserve is then adjusted for qualitative factors by segment and class. Qualitative factors are based on management's assessment of current trends that may cause losses inherent in the current loan portfolio to differ significantly from historical losses. Some factors that management considers in determining the qualitative adjustment to the general reserve include our concentration of large borrowers; national and local economic trends; general business conditions; trends in local real estate markets; economic, political, and industry specific factors that affect resource development in Alaska; effects of various political activities; peer group data; and internal factors such as underwriting policies and expertise of the Company's employees.\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An unallocated reserve - The unallocated portion of the Allowance provides for other credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the specific and general components of the Allowance, and it acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models.

acquisition of APB on April 1, 2014 were recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date. Credit discounts were included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses was not recorded at the acquisition date. Purchased credit impaired loans were evaluated on a loan by loan basis and the valuation allowance for these loans was netted against the carrying value. Deterioration in credit quality of the acquired loans subsequent to acquisition date results in the establishment of an allowance. Management assesses the credit impairment for the loans that were acquired in connection with the acquisition of APB as part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company's entire loan portfolio. Management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, gross and net chargeoffs, and movement in loan balances within the risk classifications. As of December 31, 2017, $629,000 of the original $141.5 million of purchased loans, or 0.44%, had migrated from pass grade loans to substandard loans. These loans are included in impaired loans as of December 31, 2017, and have been evaluated for specific impairment as part of the calculation of the Allowance. There was no specific impairment on these loans at December 31, 2017 or 2016, respectively. There was no Allowance related to acquired loans at December 31, 2017 or 2016, however, the purchase discount related to these acquired credit impaired loans was $803,000 and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe provision for loan losses in 2017 as compared to 2016 increased $902,000 to $3.2 million compared to $2.3 million in 2016. This increase is primarily due to an increase in nonperforming loans and the portion of the Allowance specific to impaired loans. The Company determined that an Allowance of $21.5 million, or 2.25% of portfolio loans, is appropriate as of December 31, 2017 based on our analysis of the current credit quality of the portfolio and current economic conditions. The provision for loan losses in 2016 as compared to 2015 increased $544,000 to $2.3 million compared to $1.8 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due an increase in nonperforming loans in 2016 compared to the prior year as well as an increase in qualitative factors mostly due to softening in the Alaska economy in 2016. The provision for loan losses in 2015 as compared to 2014 increased $2.4 million to $1.8 million compared to a benefit, or negative expense, of $636,000 in 2014. This increase was primarily due to net recoveries on loans in 2014 that led to a negative loan loss provision in that year. The provision for loan losses in 2014 as compared to 2013 was relatively flat despite an increase in net recoveries in 2014 primarily due to an increase in loan volume that same year.\nWhile management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the Allowance, unforeseen market conditions and other events could result in an adjustment to the Allowance, and net income could be significantly affected if circumstances differed substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination of the Allowance.\nPurchased Receivables\nWe purchase accounts receivable from our business customers and provide them with short-term working capital. We provide this service to our customers in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and some other states through NFS.\nOur purchased receivable activity is guided by policies that outline risk management, documentation, and approval limits. The policies are reviewed and approved annually by the Company's Board of Directors. In 2012, the Company established a reserve for purchased receivable losses. Purchased receivables are recorded on the balance sheet net of this reserve.\nPurchased receivable balances increased at December 31, 2017 to $22.2 million from $20.5 million at December 31, 2016, and year-to-date average purchased receivable balances were $15.9 million, $13.3 million, and $13.4 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 is attributable to increased average balances, as well as higher yields. Purchased receivable income was $3.0 million, $2.3 million, and $2.3 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding changes in the purchased receivable reserve for the years indicated:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Charge-offs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Recoveries\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net recoveries (charge-offs)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for (recovery from) purchased receivables\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(138\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of net charge-offs (recoveries) to average purchased receivables during the period\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.23\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits\nDeposits are our primary source of funds.

The following table sets forth the amount outstanding of certificates of deposits in amounts of $100,000 or more by time remaining until maturity and percentage of total deposits as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Time Certificates of Deposits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>of $100,000 or More\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total Deposits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts maturing in:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 3 through 6 months\n</td> <td>6,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 6 through 12 months\n</td> <td>27,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 12 months\n</td> <td>19,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$61,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is also a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry System ( CDARS\u201d) which is a network of over 3,000 banks throughout the United States. The CDARS system was founded in 2003 and allows participating banks to exchange FDIC insurance coverage so that 100% of the balance of their customers' certificates of deposit is fully subject to FDIC insurance. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had nothing in CDARS certificates of deposit.\nBorrowings\nFHLB: The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the \"FHLB\"). As a member, the Bank is eligible to obtain advances from the FHLB. FHLB advances are dependent on the availability of acceptable collateral such as marketable securities or real estate loans, although all FHLB advances are secured by a blanket pledge of the Company's assets. At December 31, 2017, our maximum borrowing line from the FHLB was $531.7 million, approximately 35% of the Company's assets, subject to the FHLB's collateral requirements. The Company has outstanding advances of $7.4 million as of December 31, 2017 which were originated to match fund low income housing projects that qualify for long term fixed interest rates. The first advance is a $2.2 million FHLB Community Investment Program advance which was originated on March 22, 2013. It has an eighteen year term with a 30 year amortization period, which mirrors the term of the term real estate loan made to the borrower, and a fixed rate of 3.12%. The second advance is a $2.3 million FHLB Community Investment Cash Advance Program advance that was originated in the second quarter of 2016. This advance has a 20 year term with a 30 year amortization period, which mirrors the term of the term real estate loan made to the borrower, and a fixed interest rate of 2.61%. The last advance is a $3.1 million FHLB Community Investment Cash Advance Program advance that was originated in the third quarter of 2017. This advance has a 20 year term with a 30 year amortization period and a fixed interest rate of 3.25%, which mirrors the term of the loan made to the borrower. All of these FHLB advances are included in borrowings.\nFederal Reserve Bank: The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the \"Federal Reserve Bank\") is holding $73.6 million of loans as collateral to secure advances made through the discount window on December 31, 2017. There were no discount window advances outstanding at December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nOther Short-term Borrowings: Securities sold under agreements to repurchase were $27.7 million and $27.6 million, for December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The average balance outstanding of securities sold under agreements to repurchase during 2017 and 2016 was $29.0 million and $27.2 million, respectively, and the maximum outstanding at any month-end was $32.6 million and $30.5 million, respectively, during the same time periods. The securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the FHLB under the Company's control.\nThe Company is subject to provisions under Alaska state law which generally limits the amount of outstanding debt to 15% of total assets or $225.8 million and $227.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLong-term Borrowings: The Company had no long-term borrowings outstanding other than the FHLB advance noted above as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table references contractual obligations of the Company for the periods

If a benefit payment schedule is established, payments are recorded in the corresponding dates listed in the table above. Unscheduled payments for all remaining benefits are recorded \"Over 5 Years\". Additional information about employee benefit plans is provided in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.\nThe table above does not include interest payments.\nShort and long-term borrowings included in the table above are described in the \"Borrowings\" section above. Junior subordinated debentures include $8.2 million that was originated on May 8, 2003, was redeemed on August 15, 2017, and bore interest at a rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 3.15%, adjusted quarterly, and $10.3 million that was originated on December 16, 2005, matures on March 15, 2036, and bears interest at a rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 1.37%, adjusted quarterly. The Company entered into an interest rate swap in the third quarter of 2017 to hedge the variability in cash flows arising out of its junior subordinated debentures, by swapping the cash flows with an interest rate swap which receives floating and pays fixed. The Company has designated this interest rate swap as a hedging instrument. The interest rate swap effectively fixes the Company's interest payments on the $10 million of junior subordinated debentures held under NST2 at 3.72% through its maturity date. Operating lease obligations are more fully described in Note 17 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Other long-term liabilities consist of amounts that the Company owes for its investments in Delaware limited partnerships that develop low-income housing projects throughout the United States. The Company purchased a $10.7 million interest in R4 Frontier Housing Partners L.P., Coronado Park Senior Village L.P. (\"R4-Coronado\") in March 2013. The investment in R4-Coronado is expected to be fully funded in 2029. The Company also purchased an $8.5 million interest in R4 Frontier Housing Partners L.P., Mountain View Village V L.P. (\"R4-MVV\") in May 2014. The investment in R4-MVV was 97% funded by the end of 2017 and is expected to be fully funded in 2030. The Company also purchased a $6.8 million interest in R4 Frontier Housing Partners L.P., PJ33 L.P. (\"R4-PJ33\") in June 2016. The investment in R4-PJ33 is expected to be 95% funded by the end of 2018 and fully funded in 2032.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. Among the off-balance sheet items entered into in the ordinary course of business are commitments to extend credit, commitments to originate loans held for sale and the issuance of letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the balance sheet. Certain commitments are collateralized. We apply the same credit standards to these commitments as in all of our lending activities and include these commitments in our lending risk evaluations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to extend credit of $283.9 million which were not reflected on our balance sheet compared to $236.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers. These commitments have specified interest rates and generally have fixed expiration dates but may be terminated by the Company if certain conditions of the contract are violated. Collateral held relating to these commitments varies, but generally includes real estate, inventory, accounts receivable, and equipment. Our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, these total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to originate loans held for sale of $43.6 million, which were not reflected in the balance sheet compared to $62.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mortgage loans sold to investors may be sold with servicing rights released, for which the Company makes only standard legal representations and warranties as to meeting certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards. In the past two years, the Company has had to repurchase one loan due to deficiencies in underwriting or loan documentation and has not realized significant losses related to this repurchase. Management currently believes that any liabilities that may result from such recourse provisions are not significant.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had standby letters of credit of $7.6 million which were not reflected on our balance sheet compared to $9.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Credit risk arises in these transactions from the possibility that a customer may not be able to repay the Company upon default of performance. Collateral held for standby letters of credit is based on an individual evaluation of each customer's creditworthiness.\nOur total unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2017, which includes commitments to extend credit, commitments to originate loans held for sale and standby letters of credit, were $335.1 million, compared to $309.0 million as of December 31, 2016. We do not expect that all of these commitments are likely to be fully drawn upon at any one time. The Company has established reserves of $152,000 and $122,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for losses related to these commitments that are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nAdditional information regarding Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements is included in Notes 17 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is from dividends received from the Bank. Such dividends arise from the cash flow and earnings of the Bank. Banking regulations and regulatory authorities may limit the amount of, or require the Bank to obtain certain approvals before paying, dividends to the Company. Given that the Bank currently meets and the Bank anticipates that they will continue to meet, all applicable capital adequacy requirements for a well-capitalized\u201d institution by regulatory standards, the Company expects to continue to receive dividends from the Bank during 2018. A requirement to have a conservation buffer began being phased-in in 2016 and this requirement could adversely affect the Bank's ability to pay dividends.\nThe Bank manages its liquidity through its Asset and Liability Committee. Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits and advances from the FHLB. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, other borrowed funds, retained earnings, and equity are used to make loans, to acquire securities and other assets, and to fund deposit flows and continuing operations. The primary sources of demands on our liquidity are customer demands for withdrawal of deposits and borrowers' demands that we advance funds against unfunded lending commitments. Our total unfunded commitments to fund loans, loans held for sale, and letters of credit at December 31, 2017, were $335.1 million. We do not expect that all of these loans are likely to be fully drawn upon at any one time. Additionally, as noted above, our total deposits at December 31, 2017, were $1.3 billion.\nAs shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, net cash provided by operating activities was $19.3 million, $20.1 million, and $10.6 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively. The primary source of cash provided by operating activities for all periods presented was positive net income in each of these periods. The primary reason that net cash provided by operating\nactivities decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016 was that the Company had a net proceeds of $17.8 million in 2017 compared to $32.4 million in 2016 from sales of loans held for sale. Net cash of $30.4 million was provided by investing activities in 2017 as the Company's proceeds from security sales, maturities, and calls were greater than funds used to purchase additional investment securities in 2017. $47.5 million and $63.5 million of cash were used in investing activities in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as the Company invested available cash primarily in available for sale securities and portfolio loans. Financing activities used cash of $22.4 million in 2017, and provided cash of $19.3 million, and $42.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Financing activities used net cash in 2017 as compared to providing cash in 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in deposit balances in 2017 compared to 2016, as well as the use of cash to redeem $8.2 million in junior subordinated debt in 2017.\nThe sources by which we meet the liquidity needs of our customers are current assets and borrowings available through our correspondent banking relationships and our credit lines with the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. At December 31, 2017, our current assets were $466.6 million and our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were $593.4 million. Given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs, we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient in the foreseeable future.\nDuring 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per common share for the first and second quarters and $0.22 per common share for the third and fourth quarters. These dividends were made pursuant to our existing dividend policy and in consideration of, among other things, earnings, regulatory capital levels, liquidity, asset quality, and the overall payout ratio. We expect that the dividend rate will be reassessed on a quarterly basis by the Board of Directors in accordance with the dividend policy. The payment of cash dividends is subject to regulatory limitations as described under the Supervision and Regulation section of Part I of this report. There is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased.\nOn February 22, 2018, the Board of Directors approved payment of a $0.24 per share dividend on March 16, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 8, 2018. This dividend is consistent with the Company's dividends that were declared and paid in 2017.\nIn September 2002, our Board of Directors approved a plan whereby we would periodically repurchase for cash up to approximately 5% of our shares of common stock in the open market. We purchased an aggregate of 688,442 shares of our stock under this program through December 31, 2009 at a total cost of $14.2 million at an average price of $20.65, which left a balance of 227,242 shares available under the stock repurchase program. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares in 2010 through 2016. In 2017, we purchased an aggregate of 58,341 shares at an average price of $27.56, which leaves a balance of 168,901 shares available under the stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2017. We intend to continue to repurchase our stock from time-to-time depending upon market conditions, but we can make no assurances that we will continue this program or that we will repurchase all of the authorized shares. The table below shows this effect on diluted earnings per share.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ending:\n</td> <td>Diluted\nEPS as\nReported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Diluted EPS without Stock Repurchase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>$1.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1.69\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>$2.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1.87\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>$2.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>$2.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.29\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>$1.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1.67\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn May 8, 2003, the Company's subsidiary, NCT1, issued trust preferred securities in the principal amount of $8 million. These securities carried an interest rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 3.15% per annum that was initially set at 4.45% adjusted quarterly. The securities had a maturity date of May 15, 2033, and were callable by the Company on or after May 15, 2008. These securities were treated as Tier 1 capital by the Company's regulators for capital adequacy calculations. The Company redeemed these trust preferred securities on August 15, 2017. The interest cost to the Company of the trust preferred securities was $219,000 in 2017.\nOn December 16, 2005, the Company's subsidiary, NST2, issued trust preferred securities in the principal amount of $10 million. These securities carry an interest rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 1.37% per annum that was initially set at 5.86% adjusted quarterly. The securities have a maturity date of March 15, 2036, and are callable by the Company on or after March 15, 2011. These securities are treated as Tier 1 capital by the Company's regulators for capital adequacy calculations. The interest cost to the Company of these securities was $268,000 in 2017. At December 31, 2017, the securities had an interest rate of 2.96%. The\nCompany entered into an interest rate swap in the third quarter of 2017 to hedge the variability in cash flows arising out of its junior subordinated debentures, by swapping the cash flows with an interest rate swap which receives floating and pays fixed. The Company has designated this interest rate swap as a hedging instrument. The interest rate swap effectively fixes the Company's interest payments on the $10 million of junior subordinated debentures held under NST2 at 3.72% through its maturity date.\nOur shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017, was $192.8 million, as compared to $186.7 million at December 31, 2016. The Company earned net income of $13.2 million during 2017 and issued 32,414 shares through the exercise of stock options. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 6.9 million shares of its common stock outstanding.\nWe are subject to minimum capital requirements. Federal banking agencies have adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies. The requirements address both risk-based capital and leverage capital. We believe as of December 31, 2017, that the Company and the Bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements for a well-capitalized\u201d institution by regulatory standards.\nThe table below illustrates the capital requirements in effect in 2017 for the Company and the Bank and the actual capital ratios for each entity that exceed these requirements. Management intends to maintain capital ratios for the Bank in 2018, exceeding the FDIC's new requirements for the well-capitalized\u201d classification. The capital ratios for the Company exceed those for the Bank primarily because the $8 million trust preferred securities offering that the Company completed in the second quarter of 2003 and redeemed in the third quarter of 2017 and another offering of $10 million completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 are included in the Company's capital for regulatory purposes, although they are accounted for as a long-term debt in our financial statements. The trust preferred securities are not accounted for on the Bank's financial statements nor are they included in its capital. As a result, the Company has $10 million and $18 million more in regulatory capital than the Bank at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which explains most of the difference in the capital ratios for the two entities.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Minimum Required Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Well-Capitalized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual Ratio Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual Ratio Bank\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total risk-based capital\n</td> <td>8.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.90%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.08%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 risk-based capital\n</td> <td>6.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.65%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.83%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier 1 capital\n</td> <td>4.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.89%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.83%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage ratio\n</td> <td>4.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.41%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.87%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the capital ratios. The requirements for \"well-capitalized\" come from the Prompt Correction Action rules. See Item 1 Supervision and Regulation. These rules apply to the Bank but not to the Company. Under the rules of the Federal Reserve Bank, a bank holding company such as the Company is generally defined to be \"well capitalized\" if its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 8.0% or more and its total risk-based capital ratio is 10.0% or more.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices: The primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates, which could affect the degree and timing of the repricing of our assets and liabilities. In addition, inflation has an impact on our customers' ability to repay their loans.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion highlights key information as determined by management but may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding, the following should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 included elsewhere in this report.\nThis annual report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nExecutive Overview\nNet income attributable to the Company decreased 9% to $13.2 million or $1.88 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $14.4 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Significant items contributing to the decline in 2017 compared to 2016 were:\n \u2022 the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets to comply with recently enacted federal tax legislation, \n \u2022 a decline in net income attributable to the Company in the Home Mortgage Lending segment due primarily to the relative general weakness of the Alaska economy and a writedown in the carrying value of the Company's minority ownership interest in a mortgage origination business owned by RML, \n \u2022 an increase in the provision for loan losses mostly as a result of an increase in nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, as well as an increase in the portion of the allowance for loan losses specific to impaired loans, \n \u2022 one-time costs associated with the conversion of the Company's core system, and \n \u2022 an increase in expenses associated with OREO, net of gains on the sale of OREO and rental income on OREO properties. \nThese items were partially offset by a $4.4 million gain recognized on the sale of the assets of NBG and a decrease in compensation expense for acquisition payments related to the Company's 2014 acquisition of RML.\nThe following are other significant items for the year ended December 31, 2017:\n \u2022 Total revenues, which include net interest income plus other operating income, decreased 1% to $98.2 million in 2017 from $99.6 million in 2016. This decrease mainly reflects decreased mortgage banking income, which was partially offset by the gain on the sale of the assets of NBG. \n \u2022 Average portfolio loans increased slightly to $981.0 million in 2017 compared to $976.6 in 2016, primarily reflecting growth in the commercial and construction loan portfolios which was partially offset by a decrease in the commercial real estate loan portfolio. \n \u2022 The provision for loan losses increased in 2017 to $3.2 million from $2.3 million in 2016. We experienced net charge-offs of $1.4 million in 2017 as compared to $754,000 in 2016; additionally, nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, increased to $21.4 million at the end of 2017 compared to $12.9 million at the end of 2016, while total adversely classified loans, net of government guarantees at December 31, 2017 decreased from $35.6 million at December 31, 2016 to $33.8 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses ( Allowance\u201d) totaled 2.25% of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2017, compared to 2.02% at December 31, 2016. The Allowance compared to nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, decreased to 100% at December 31, 2017 from 152% at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 The Company continued to maintain strong capital ratios with Tier 1 Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets of 14.65% at December 31, 2017 as compared to 14.54% at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Book value per share increased 3.7% to $28.06 per share at December 31, 2017 compared to $27.07 per share at December 31, 2016 while tangible book value increased 4.0% to $25.70 per share at December 31, 2017, compared to $24.70 per share at December 31, 2016. Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP ratio defined as shareholders' equity, less intangible assets, divided by common shares outstanding. Management believes that tangible book value is a useful measurement of the value of the Company's equity because it excludes the effect of intangible assets on the Company's equity. See reconciliation to book value per share, the most comparable GAAP measurement under \"Selected Financial Data - Reconciliation of Selected Financial Data to GAAP Financial Measures\" in this report. \n \u2022 The aggregate cash dividends paid by the Company in 2017, rose 10% to $0.86 per diluted share from $0.78 per diluted share paid in 2016. \n \u2022 The Company repurchased 58,341 shares of its common stock in the third quarter of 2017 at an average price of $27.56 per share, leaving 168,901 shares available under the previously announced repurchase authorization. \n \u2022 The Company redeemed $8.0 million in junior subordinated debt held at Northrim Capital Trust 1. This liability bore interest at a floating rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 3.15%, or 4.33% at the time it was redeemed, and had a final maturity \nof May 15, 2033. In 2016, total interest expense on this debt was $310,000. Interest expense on this debt in 2017 through the date of redemption on August 15, 2017 was $212,000. This redemption decreased Tier 1 Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets and Total Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets by 62 basis points each.\n \u2022 An interest rate swap executed in September 2017 effectively converts the floating rate of interest on the remaining $10.0 million in outstanding junior subordinated debt from 90-day LIBOR plus 1.37%, or 2.96% as of December 31, 2017, to a fixed rate of 3.72% through the junior subordinated debt's final maturity date of March 15, 2036.  Critical Accounting Policies\nThe SEC defines \"critical accounting policies\" as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the SEC's definition.\nAllowance for loan losses: The Company maintains an Allowance to reflect inherent losses in its loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company performs regular credit reviews of the loan portfolio to determine the credit quality and adherence to underwriting standards. When loans are originated, they are assigned a risk rating that is reassessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process. The Company's risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from 1 to 10, where a higher rating represents higher risk. These risk ratings are then consolidated into five classes, which include pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. These classes are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan losses. Each class is assessed an inherent credit loss factor that determines an amount of allowance for loan losses provided for that group of loans. This allowance is then adjusted for qualitative factors, by segment and class. Qualitative factors are based on management's assessment of current trends that may cause losses inherent in the current loan portfolio to differ significantly from historical losses. Some factors that management considers in determining the qualitative adjustment to the general reserve include loan quality trends in our own portfolio, the degree of concentrations of large borrowers in our loan portfolio, national and local economic trends, business conditions, underwriting policies and standards, trends in local real estate markets, effects of various political activities, peer group data, and internal factors such as underwriting policies and expertise of the Company's employees.\nRegular credit reviews of the portfolio also identify loans that are considered potentially impaired. A loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events, we determine that we will probably not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract, including scheduled interest payments. When we identify a loan as impaired, we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows, except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral. In these cases, we use the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, instead of discounted cash flows. The analysis of collateral dependent loans includes appraisals on loans secured by real property, management's assessment of the current market, recent payment history and an evaluation of other sources of repayment. The Company obtains appraisals on real and personal property that secure its loans during the loan origination process in accordance with regulatory guidance and its loan policy. The Company obtains updated appraisals on loans secured by real or personal property based upon its assessment of changes in the current market or particular projects or properties, information from other current appraisals and other sources of information. The Company uses the information provided in these updated appraisals along with its evaluation of all other information available on a particular property as it assesses the collateral coverage on its performing and nonperforming loans and the impact that may have on the adequacy of its Allowance.\nIf we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we either recognize an impairment reserve as a specific component to be provided for in the Allowance or charge-off the impaired balance on collateral dependent loans if it is determined that such amount represents a confirmed loss. The combination of the risk rating-based allowance component and the impairment reserve allowance component lead to an allocated allowance for loan losses.\nFinally, the Company assesses the overall adequacy of the Allowance based on several factors including the level of the Allowance as compared to total loans and nonperforming loans in light of current economic conditions. This portion of the Allowance is deemed unallocated\u201d because it is not allocated to any segment or class of the loan portfolio. This portion of the Allowance provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the credit loss factors that are utilized in the risk rating-based component or in the specific impairment component of the Allowance and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models.\nThe unallocated portion of the Allowance is based upon management's evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the allocated portions of the Allowance. Such factors include uncertainties in identifying triggering events that directly correlate to subsequent loss rates, uncertainties in economic conditions, risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors, and historical loss experience data that may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio. In addition, the unallocated reserve may fluctuate based upon the direction of various risk indicators. Examples of such factors include the risk as to current and prospective economic conditions, the level and trend of charge offs or recoveries, and the risk of heightened imprecision or inconsistency of appraisals used in estimating real estate values. Although this allocation process may not accurately predict credit losses by loan type or in aggregate, the total allowance for credit losses is available to absorb losses that may arise from any loan type or category. Due to the subjectivity involved in the determination of the unallocated portion of the Allowance, the relationship of the unallocated component to the total Allowance may fluctuate from period to period.\nBased on our methodology and its components, management believes the resulting Allowance is adequate and appropriate for the risk identified in the Company's loan portfolio. Given current processes employed by the Company, management believes the segments, classes, and estimated loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be material to the Company's financial statements. In addition, current loan classes and fair value estimates of collateral are subject to change as we continue to review loans within our portfolio and as our borrowers are impacted by economic trends within their market areas. Although we have established an Allowance that we consider adequate, there can be no assurance that the established Allowance will be sufficient to offset losses on loans in the future. In addition, a substantial percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate; as a result, a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the Allowance.\nValuation of goodwill and other intangibles: Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment. Management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis as of December 31. Additionally, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists. The impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures, technology, changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions. There can be no assurance that changes in circumstances, estimates or assumptions may result in additional impairment of all, or some portion of, goodwill or other intangible assets. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing at December 31, 2017 and 2016 in accordance with the policy described in Note 1 to the financial statements included with this report. At December 31, 2017, the Company performed its annual impairment test by performing the first step of the comprehensive impairment analysis. The Company estimated the fair value of the Company using four valuation methodologies including a comparable transactions approach, a control premium approach, a public market peers approach and a discounted cash flow approach. We then compared the estimated fair value of the Company to the carrying value and concluded that no potential impairment existed as of December 31, 2017.\nValuation of OREO: OREO represents properties acquired through foreclosure or its equivalent. Prior to foreclosure, the carrying value is adjusted to the fair value, less cost to sell, of the real estate to be acquired by an adjustment to the allowance for loan loss. The amount by which the fair value less cost to sell is greater than the carrying amount of the loan plus amounts previously charged off is recognized in earnings. Any subsequent reduction in the carrying value is charged against earnings. Management's evaluation of fair value is based on appraisals or discounted cash flows of anticipated sales. The amounts ultimately recovered from the sale of OREO may differ from the carrying value of the assets because of market factors beyond the Company's control or due to changes in the Company's strategies for recovering the investment.\nMortgage servicing rights: The Company measures mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\") at fair value on a recurring basis and reports changes in fair value through earnings in mortgage banking income in the period in which the change occurs. Fair value adjustments encompass market-driven valuation changes and the decrease in value that occurs from the passage of time, which are separately reported. Retained MSRs are measured at fair value as of the date of sale. Initial and subsequent fair value measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model. In order to determine the fair value of the MSR, the present value of expected net future cash flows is estimated. Assumptions used include market discount rates, anticipated prepayment speeds, escrow calculations, delinquency rates and ancillary fee income net of servicing costs. The model assumptions are also compared to publicly filed information from several large MSR holders, as available.\nFair Value: A hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability is utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Pricing observability is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIncome Statement\nNet Income\nOur results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income. We also generate other income primarily through mortgage banking income, purchased receivables products, sales of employee benefit plans (through August of 2017, when we sold the assets of NBG), service charges and fees, bankcard fees and rental income. Our operating expenses consist in large part of salaries and other personnel costs, occupancy, data processing, marketing, and professional services expenses and compensation expense for RML acquisition payments. Interest income and cost of funds, or interest expense, are affected significantly by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, by government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities and by competition in our markets.\nWe earned net income attributable to the Company of $13.2 million in 2017, compared to net income of $14.4 million in 2016, and $17.8 million in 2015. During these periods, net income per diluted share was $1.88, $2.06, and $2.56, respectively. The decrease in net income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase of $4.3 million in provision for income taxes and an increase of $902,000 in the provision for loan losses, as well as a decrease of $2.8 million in other operating income, which was primarily driven by a reduction in mortgage banking income. These changes were only partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in net interest income and a $4.6 million decrease in compensation expense - RML acquisition payments in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in net income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $2.9 million in salaries and other personnel expense and an increase of $554,000 in the provision for loan losses, as well as decreases of $1.3 million and $552,000 in other operating income and net interest income, respectively, in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nNet Interest Income / Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income from loan and investment securities portfolios and interest expense on customer deposits and borrowings. Net interest income in 2017 was $57.7 million, compared to $56.4 million in 2016, and $56.9 million in 2015. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was mainly due to increased interest income earned on long- and short-term investments and loans primarily due to higher yields in 2017 compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to decreased interest income earned on loans and loans held for sale mainly due to lower yields, which was only partially offset by increased interest income on long-term investments due to higher balances.\nChanges in net interest income result from changes in volume and spread, which in turn affect our margin. For this purpose, volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Changes in net interest income are influenced by yields and the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, net interest margins were 4.22%, 4.14%, and 4.27%, respectively. The increase in the net interest margin in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily the result of higher yields on all interest-earning assets. The decrease in net interest margin in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily the result of lower yields on portfolio loans as well as an unfavorable change in the mix of interest-earning assets as average portfolio loans decreased as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. The Company intends to continue to implement strategies designed to grow our loan portfolio, while actively managing non-performing assets, to offset the negative effect that today's relatively low interest rates have on our net interest margin.\nThe following table sets forth for the periods indicated information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities, as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields or costs, net interest income, and net interest margin are also presented:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The loan loss provision increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in nonperforming loans and an increase in the portion of the Allowance specific to impaired loans in 2017 compared to 2016. The loan loss provision increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in nonperforming loans as well as increases in qualitative factors mostly due to softening in the Alaskan economy in 2016 compared to 2015.

Mortgage banking income, which is the largest component of other operating income and represented 58% of total other operating income in 2017 and consists of gross income from the origination and sale of mortgages as well as mortgage loan servicing fees, decreased to $23.3 million in 2017 from $29.5 million in 2016, mainly due to lower mortgage production revenue resulting from lower realized gains on the sale of mortgage loans, which was partially offset by increased mortgage servicing revenue. The overall decline in mortgage banking income is primarily the result of the slowing of the Alaskan economy. Employee benefit plan income decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the sale of the assets of NBG in August 2017. Lastly, purchased receivable income increased mostly due to higher yields and balances in 2017 compared to 2016 and service charges on deposit accounts decreased primarily due to lower non-sufficient funds fees.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nThe most significant changes in other operating income in 2016 were a decrease in gains on the disposition of loans acquired in the APB transaction at a discount to par values and in gains on the sale of investment securities. Mortgage banking income, which is the largest component of other operating income and represented 68% of total other operating income in 2016 and consists of gross income from the origination and sale of mortgages as well as mortgage loan servicing fees, decreased slightly to $29.5 million in 2016 from $29.6 million in 2015 mainly due to lower mortgage production revenue resulting from lower realized gains on the sale of mortgage loans and the change in fair value of mortgage loan commitments, which was mostly offset by increased mortgage servicing revenue. Service charges on deposit accounts also decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 in part due to lower non-sufficient funds fees. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in employee benefit plan income mostly due to growth in NBG's core business operations, higher other loan fees due to increased commercial loan servicing revenue, and higher purchased receivable income mostly due to higher yields in 2016 compared to 2015 .\nOther Operating Expense\nThe following table details the major components of other operating expense for the years ended December 31:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Operating Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and other personnel expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$44,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($2,031\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$46,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$43,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy expense\n</td> <td>6,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>6,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>6,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing expense\n</td> <td>5,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>4,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>4,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing expense\n</td> <td>2,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>2,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(279\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>2,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional and outside services\n</td> <td>2,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>2,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(183\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>2,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance expense\n</td> <td>1,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>1,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>1,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation expense -

RML acquisition payments and salaries and other personnel expense, and, to a lesser extent, professional and outside services expense and loss on sale of premises and equipment. Compensation expense - RML acquisition payments decreased $4.6 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 due in part to the fact that 2016 included a $2.3 million non-cash error correction that covered the period from December 1, 2014, through June 30, 2016. The remainder of the decrease in compensation expense - RML acquisition payments resulted from a decrease in net income from RML. Salaries and other personnel expense decreased primarily due to lower originator commission expense in the home mortgage lending segment due to lower home mortgage loan originations. These decreases were partially offset by increases in impairment on OREO expense and data processing expense in 2017 compared to 2016. Impairment on OREO increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to writedowns on two OREO properties resulting from a decrease in sales price assumptions. Data processing expense increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 mostly due to higher software amortization and maintenance expense.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nOther operating expense increased in 2016 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased costs in salaries and other personnel expense and compensation expense - RML acquisition payments, and, to a lesser extent, data processing expense, occupancy expense and professional and outside services. Salaries and other personnel expenses increased on an approximately equal basis in both the community banking segment and home mortgage lending segment in 2016. Salaries and other personnel expense related to the operations of the community banking segment increased $1.4 million mainly due to higher medical costs and increases in various other benefits costs, as well as normal cost of living and performance based annual salary increases. The home mortgage lending segment had an increase in salaries and other personnel expense primarily attributable to an increase in full-time equivalent employees for new management and marketing positions and the addition of a new location in Wasilla. While compensation expense - RML acquisition payments increased $681,000 in 2016 as compared to 2015. This expense item in 2016 included a $2.3 million non-cash error correction that covered the period from December 1, 2014, through June 30, 2016. Additionally, the change in the accounting treatment of these payments also increased compensation expense - RML acquisition payments in the third and fourth quarters of 2016. The total increase in compensation expense - RML acquisition payments in 2016 resulting from the error correction and prospective change in accounting was $3.0 million. These increases were partially offset by slight decreases in insurance expense and marketing expense in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes increased $4.3 million or 71%, to $10.3 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 and decreased $2.7 million or 31%, to $6.1 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 includes $2.7 million in expense for the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset resulting from a decrease in the corporate tax rate included in federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017. Additionally, the changes in total income tax expense for these periods are due primarily to the 13% increase in income before income taxes in 2017 compared to the previous year and a 22% decrease in income before income taxes in 2016 compared to 2015. Additionally, the Company's effective tax rates were 43%, 29%, and 32% in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 is mainly due to the increase in expense resulting from the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset. The decrease in effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 is mainly due to higher tax credits and tax-exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax income in 2016 as compared to 2015. The Company believes its effective tax rate will decline to between 19% and 20% due to the new federal tax legislation in 2018.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nInvestment Securities\nThe composition of our investment securities portfolio reflects management's investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of interest income. The investment securities portfolio also mitigates interest rate and credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio, while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, a source of liquidity (by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreements), and collateral for certain public funds deposits. Investment securities designated as available for sale comprised 100% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and are available to meet liquidity requirements.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of government sponsored entity securities, corporate securities, and municipal securities. Investment securities at December 31, 2017 decreased $19.4 million, or 6%, to $312.8 million from $332.1 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016 is primarily due to a portion of the proceeds from sales, maturities, and security calls being held in short-term investment funds at December 31, 2017. The average maturity of the investment portfolio was approximately two years at December 31, 2017.\nInvestment securities may be pledged as collateral to secure public deposits or borrowings. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $51.6 million and $50.9 million in securities were pledged for deposits and borrowings, respectively. Pledged securities decreased at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016 because the Company had decreased balances in tri-party accounts at December 31, 2017.\nThe following tables set forth the composition of our investment portfolio at December 31 for the years indicated:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

in preferred stock does not have a maturity date but it has been included in the over 10 years column above. At December 31, 2017, we held no securities of any single issuer (other than government sponsored entities) that exceeded 10% of our shareholders' equity.\nLoans\nOur loan products include short and medium-term commercial loans, commercial credit lines, construction and real estate loans, and consumer loans. To a lesser extent, through our wholly-owned subsidiary RML, we also originate mortgage loans which we sell to the secondary market. We also retain servicing rights on mortgage loans originated by RML and sold to the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (\"AHFC\"). We emphasize providing financial services to small and medium-sized businesses and to individuals. From our inception, we have emphasized commercial, land development and home construction, and commercial real estate lending. These types of lending have provided us with needed market opportunities and generally provide higher net interest margins compared to other types of lending such as consumer lending. However, they also involve greater risks, including greater exposure to changes in local economic conditions.\nAll of our loans and credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations. These limitations apply to the borrower's total outstanding indebtedness and commitments to us, including the indebtedness of any guarantor. Generally, we are permitted to make loans to one borrower of up to 15% of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the Bank. The loan-to-one-borrower limitation for the Bank was $27.5 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, the Company had two relationships whose total direct and indirect commitments exceeded $27.5 million; however, no individual direct relationship exceeded the loans-to-one borrower limitation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Provision for Loan Losses\u201d for further discussion of the Company's concentration of loans to large borrowers.\nOur lending operations are guided by loan policies, which outline the basic policies and procedures by which lending operations are conducted. Generally, the policies address our desired loan types, target markets, underwriting and collateral requirements, terms, interest rate and yield considerations, and compliance with laws and regulations. The policies are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors of the Bank. Our Quality Assurance Department provides a detailed financial analysis of our largest, most complex loans. In addition, the Quality Assurance Department, along with the Senior Credit Officer of the Bank and others in the Loan Administration department, have developed processes to analyze and manage various\nconcentrations of credit within the overall loan portfolio. The Loan Administration Department monitors the procedures and processes for both the analysis and reporting of problem loans, and also develops strategies to resolve problem loans based on the facts and circumstances for each loan. Finally, our Internal Audit Department also performs an independent review of each loan portfolio for compliance with loan policy as well as a review of credit quality. The Internal Audit review follows the FDIC sampling guidelines, and a review of each portfolio is performed on an annual basis.\nThe Company acquired $138.4 million in loans in connection with the acquisition of APB on April 1, 2014.

Short-term working capital loans generally are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, or equipment. We also make longer-term commercial loans secured by equipment and real estate. We also make commercial loans that are guaranteed in large part by the Small Business Administration or the Bureau of Indian Affairs and to a lesser extent guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture, as well as commercial real estate loans that are purchased by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority ( AIDEA\u201d). Commercial loans increased to $313.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $278.2 million at December 31, 2016 and represented approximately 33% and 29% of our total loans outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Commercial loans reprice more frequently than other types of loans, such as real estate loans. More frequent repricing means that interest cash flows from commercial loans are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, our philosophy is to emphasize the pricing of loans on a floating rate basis, which allows these loans to reprice more frequently and to contribute positively to our net interest margin.\nCommercial Real Estate: We are an active lender in the commercial real estate market. At December 31, 2017, commercial real estate loans decreased to $492.0 million from $554.2 million at December 31, 2016, and represented approximately 51% and 57% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. These loans are typically secured by office buildings, apartment complexes or warehouses. Loan amortization periods range from 10 to 25 years and generally have a maximum maturity of 10 years.\nWe may sell all or a portion of a commercial real estate loan to two State of Alaska entities, AIDEA and AHFC, which were both established to provide long-term financing in the State of Alaska. The loans that AIDEA purchases typically feature a maturity twice that of the loans retained by us and bear a lower interest rate. The blend of our and AIDEA's loan terms allows us to provide competitive long-term financing to our customers, while reducing the risk inherent in this type of lending. We also originate and sell to AHFC loans secured by multifamily residential units. Typically, 100% of these loans are sold to AHFC and we provide ongoing servicing of the loans for a fee. AIDEA and AHFC make it possible for us to originate these commercial real estate loans and enhance fee income while reducing our exposure to interest rate risk.\nConstruction Loans: We provide construction lending for commercial real estate projects. Such loans generally are made only when the Company has also committed to finance the completed project with a commercial real estate loan, or if there is a firm take-out commitment upon completion of the project by a third party lender. Additionally, we provide land development and residential subdivision construction loans. We also originate one-to-four-family residential and condominium construction loans to builders for construction of homes. The Company's construction loans increased in 2017 to $111.3 million, up from $98.2\nmillion in 2016, and represented approximately 12% and 10% of our loan portfolio in December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $30.5 million or 27%, of the Company's construction loans were for low income housing tax credit projects as compared to $31.7 million or 32% as of December 31, 2016.\nConsumer Loans: We provide personal loans for automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats, and other larger consumer purchases. We provide both secured and unsecured consumer credit lines to accommodate the needs of our individual customers, with home equity lines of credit serving as the major product in this area.\nLoans Directly Exposed to the Oil and Gas Industry: The Company defines \"direct exposure\" to the oil and gas industry as companies that it has identified as significantly reliant upon activity related to the oil and gas industry, such as oil producers or drilling and exploration companies, and companies who provide oilfield services, lodging, equipment rental, transportation, and other logistic services specific to the industry. The Company estimates that $70.8 million, or approximately 7% of loans as of December 31, 2017 have direct exposure to the oil and gas industry as compared to $57.4 million, or approximately 6% of loans as of December 31, 2016. The Company has no loans to oil producers or drilling and exploration companies as of the end of 2017 or 2016, but the $70.8 million outstanding as of December 31, 2017 noted above does include $9.2 million related to the construction of an oil rig. The Company's unfunded commitments to borrowers that have direct exposure to the oil and gas industry were $53.5 million and $52.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The portion of the Company's allowance for loan losses that related to the loans with direct exposure to the oil and gas industry was estimated at $1.8 million and $1.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following table details loan balances by loan segment asset quality rating (\"AQR\") and class of financing receivable for loans with direct oil and gas exposure as of the

December 31, 2017, 62% of the portfolio was scheduled to mature or reprice in 2018 with 36% scheduled to mature or reprice between 2019 and 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 70% of commercial loans are variable rate loans, of which 70% reprice within one year. The majority of these loans reprice to an index based upon the prime rate of interest or the respective Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the \"Boston FHLB\") rate. The Company also uses floors in its commercial loan pricing as loans are originated or renewed during the year.\nAt December 31, 2017, the interest rates for approximately 89% of commercial real estate loans are variable, of which 51% reset within one year. Approximately 45% of commercial real estate variable rate loans reprice in greater than one year but within three years. The indices for these loans include the prime rate of interest or the respective Treasury or Boston FHLB rate. The Company also uses floors in its commercial real estate loan pricing as loans are originated or renewed during the year.\nLoans Held for Sale and Mortgage Servicing Rights: The Company originates residential mortgage loans and sells them in the secondary market through our wholly-owned subsidiary, RML. All residential mortgage loans originated and sold in 2017 and 2016 were newly originated loans that did not affect nonperforming loans. The Company also has a mortgage servicing portfolio which is comprised of 1-4 family loans serviced for FHLMC and AHFC. The Company retains servicing rights on all mortgage loans originated by RML and sold to AHFC. Mortgages originated by RML and sold to AHFC represent approximately 26% and 20% of the mortgages originated by RML in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Mortgage servicing rights are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in mortgage banking income. The value of mortgage servicing rights is impacted by market rates for mortgage loans primarily due to how changes in interest rates affect prepayments of mortgage loans. To the extent loans are prepaid sooner than estimated at the time servicing assets are originally recorded, it is possible that certain residential mortgage servicing rights assets may decrease in value. Generally, the fair value of our residential mortgage servicing rights are expected to increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall.\nCredit Quality and Nonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, accruing loans that are 90 days or more past due, repossessed assets and OREO.

This increase was primarily due to the addition of two borrowing relationships to nonaccrual status in 2017. There was interest income of $142,000, $181,000, and $617,000 recognized in net income for 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively, related to interest collected on nonaccrual loans whose principal has been paid down to zero. The Company had three relationships that represented more than 10% of nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company had $7.7 million and $6.1 million in loans classified as troubled debt restructuring loans (\"TDRs\") that were performing as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additionally, there were $16.2 million and $10.1 million in TDRs included in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016 for total TDRs of $23.8 million and $16.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in TDRs at December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to several additions to loans classified as TDRs that were only partially offset by paydowns on TDRs in 2017. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of TDRs.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $30.5 million in loans measured for impairment, net of government guarantees as compared to $37.0 million in loans measured for impairment, net of government guarantees at December 31, 2016. The decrease of $6.5 million is mostly attributable to the transfer of one large borrowing relationship from loans to OREO. The total amount of loans measured for impairment for this borrower was $5.9 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, management had identified potential problem loans of $9.5 million as compared to potential problem loans of $18.2 million at December 31, 2016. Potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing that have developed negative indications that the borrower may not be able to comply with present payment terms and which may later be included in nonaccrual, past due, or impaired loans. The $8.7 million decrease in potential problem loans at December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 was primarily due to one $11.4 million relationship that was upgraded and a $4.6 million relationship which moved to OREO. These decreases were partially offset by the addition of one $6.3 million relationship.\nThe following summarizes OREO activity for the periods indicated:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transfers from loans\n</td> <td>5,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment in other real estate owned\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the sale of other real estate owned\n</td> <td>(3,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(934\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2,733\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of other real estate owned, net\n</td> <td>371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred gain on sale of other real estate owned\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment on other real estate owned\n</td> <td>(904\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(361\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016 the Company held $8.7 million and $6.6 million, respectively, of OREO assets. At December 31, 2017, OREO consists of $3.0 million in residential lots in various stages of development and a $5.7 million commercial building. All OREO property is located in Alaska. The Bank initiates foreclosure proceedings to recover and sell collateral pledged by a debtor to secure a loan based on various events of default and circumstances related to loans that are secured by either commercial or residential real property. These events and circumstances include delinquencies, the Company's relationship with the borrower, and the borrower's ability to repay the loan via a source other than the collateral. If the loan has not yet matured, the debtors may cure the events of default up to the time of sale to retain their interest in the collateral. Failure to cure the defaults will result in the debtor losing ownership interest in the property, which is taken by the creditor, or high bidder at a foreclosure sale.\nDuring 2017, additions to OREO totaled $5.9 million which included a $5.7 million commercial building and a $167,000 single-family residence. During 2017, the Company received approximately $3.3 million in proceeds from the sale of OREO which included $672,000 from the sale of multi-family residential units, $1.4 million from the sale of lots and land, $832,000 from the sale of single-family residences, $360,000 from the sale of a commercial building, and $33,000 from recovery of guarantees on previously disposed OREO properties. The Company recognized $391,000, $295,000, and $284,000 in gains and $19,000, $0, and $0 in losses on the sale of OREO properties in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nThe Company also recognized $0, $0, and $34,000 in gains on sales previously deferred resulting in net gains of $371,000, $295,000, and $315,000 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company had remaining accumulated deferred gains on the sale of OREO properties of $262,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company did not make any loans to facilitate the sale of OREO in 2017, 2016, or 2015. Our underwriting policies and procedures for loans to facilitate the sale of OREO are no different than our standard loan policies and procedures.\nThe Company recognized impairments of $904,000, $187,000 and $361,000 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, due to adjustments to the Company's estimate of the fair value of certain properties based on changes in estimated costs to complete the projects, decrease in expected sales prices, and changes in the Anchorage, Fairbanks, and the Southeastern Alaska real estate markets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains an Allowance to reflect management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and loan recoveries and decreased by loan charge-offs. The size of the Allowance is determined through quarterly assessments of probable estimated losses in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for making such assessments and determining the adequacy of the Allowance includes the following key elements:\n \u2022 A specific allocation for impaired loans. Management determines the fair value of the majority of these loans based on the underlying collateral values. This analysis is based upon a specific analysis for each impaired loan, including external appraisals on loans secured by real property, management's assessment of the current market, recent payment history, and an evaluation of other sources of repayment. In-house evaluations of fair value are used in the impairment analysis in some situations. Inputs to the in-house evaluation process include information about sales of comparable properties in the appropriate markets and changes in tax assessed values. The Company obtains appraisals on real and personal property that secure its loans during the loan origination process in accordance with regulatory guidance and its loan policy. The Company obtains updated appraisals on loans secured by real or personal property based upon its assessment of changes in the current market or particular projects or properties, information from other current appraisals, and other sources of information. Appraisals may be adjusted downward by the Company based on its evaluation of the facts and circumstances on a case by case basis. External appraisals may be discounted when management believes that the absorption period used in the appraisal is unrealistic, when expected liquidation costs exceed those included in the appraisal, or when management's evaluation of deteriorating market conditions warrants an adjustment. Additionally, the Company may also adjust appraisals in the above circumstances between appraisal dates. The Company uses the information provided in these updated appraisals along with its evaluation of all other information available on a particular property as it assesses the collateral coverage on its performing and nonperforming loans and the impact that may have on the adequacy of its Allowance. The specific allowance for impaired loans, as well as the overall Allowance, may increase based on the Company's assessment of updated appraisals. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the Company's estimation of impaired loans measured at fair value.  When the Company determines that a loss has occurred on an impaired loan, a charge-off equal to the difference between carrying value and fair value is recorded. If a specific allowance is deemed necessary for a loan, and then that loan is partially charged off, the loan remains classified as a nonperforming loan after the charge-off is recognized.\n \u2022 A general allocation - The Company has identified segments and classes of loans not considered impaired for purposes of establishing the general allocation allowance. The Company disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments and classes based on its assessment of how different pools of loans with like characteristics in the portfolio behave over time. This determination is based on historical experience and management's assessment of how current facts and circumstances are expected to affect the loan portfolio.  The Company first disaggregates the loan portfolio into the following eight segments: commercial, real estate construction one-to-four family, real estate construction other, real estate term owner occupied, real estate term non-owner occupied, real estate term other, consumer secured by 1st deeds of trust, and other consumer loans.\nAfter division of the loan portfolio into segments, the Company then further disaggregates each of the segments into classes. The Company has a total of five classes, which are based off of the Company's loan risk grading system known as the Asset Quality Rating ( AQR\u201d) system. The risk ratings are discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. There are five loan classes: pass (pass AQR grades, which\nare grades 1 - 6), special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. There have been no changes to these loan classes in 2017.\nAfter the portfolio has been disaggregated into segments and classes, the Company calculates a general reserve for each segment and class based on the average loss history for each segment and class. The Company utilizes a look-back period of five years in the calculation of average historical loss rates.\nAfter the Company calculates a general allocation using our loss history, the general reserve is then adjusted for qualitative factors by segment and class. Qualitative factors are based on management's assessment of current trends that may cause losses inherent in the current loan portfolio to differ significantly from historical losses. Some factors that management considers in determining the qualitative adjustment to the general reserve include our concentration of large borrowers; national and local economic trends; general business conditions; trends in local real estate markets; economic, political, and industry specific factors that affect resource development in Alaska; effects of various political activities; peer group data; and internal factors such as underwriting policies and expertise of the Company's employees.\n \u2022 An unallocated reserve - The unallocated portion of the Allowance provides for other credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the specific and general components of the Allowance, and it acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models. The unallocated component is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses and overall economic conditions. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the unallocated allowance as a percentage of the total Allowance was 16% and 7%, respectively.  The following table shows the allocation of the Allowance for the years indicated:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

loans acquired in connection with our acquisition of APB on April 1, 2014 were recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date. Credit discounts were included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses was not recorded at the acquisition date. Purchased credit impaired loans were evaluated on a loan by loan basis and the valuation allowance for these loans was netted against the carrying value. Deterioration in credit quality of the acquired loans subsequent to acquisition date results in the establishment of an allowance. Management assesses the credit impairment for the loans that were acquired in connection with the acquisition of APB as part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company's entire loan portfolio. Management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, gross and net chargeoffs, and movement in loan balances within the risk classifications. As of December 31, 2017, $629,000 of the original $141.5 million of purchased loans, or 0.44%, had migrated from pass grade loans to substandard loans. These loans are included in impaired loans as of December 31, 2017, and have been evaluated for specific impairment as part of the calculation of the Allowance. There was no specific impairment on these loans at December 31, 2017 or 2016, respectively. There was no Allowance related to acquired loans at December 31, 2017 or 2016, however, the purchase discount related to these acquired credit impaired loans was $803,000 and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe provision for loan losses in 2017 as compared to 2016 increased $902,000 to $3.2 million compared to $2.3 million in 2016. This increase is primarily due to an increase in nonperforming loans and the portion of the Allowance specific to impaired loans. The Company determined that an Allowance of $21.5 million, or 2.25% of portfolio loans, is appropriate as of December 31, 2017 based on our analysis of the current credit quality of the portfolio and current economic conditions. The provision for loan losses in 2016 as compared to 2015 increased $544,000 to $2.3 million compared to $1.8 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due an increase in nonperforming loans in 2016 compared to the prior year as well as an increase in qualitative factors mostly due to softening in the Alaska economy in 2016. The provision for loan losses in 2015 as compared to 2014 increased $2.4 million to $1.8 million compared to a benefit, or negative expense, of $636,000 in 2014. This increase was primarily due to net recoveries on loans in 2014 that led to a negative loan loss provision in that year. The provision for loan losses in 2014 as compared to 2013 was relatively flat despite an increase in net recoveries in 2014 primarily due to an increase in loan volume that same year.\nWhile management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the Allowance, unforeseen market conditions and other events could result in an adjustment to the Allowance, and net income could be significantly affected if circumstances differed substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination of the Allowance.\nPurchased Receivables\nWe purchase accounts receivable from our business customers and provide them with short-term working capital. We provide this service to our customers in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and some other states through NFS.\nOur purchased receivable activity is guided by policies that outline risk management, documentation, and approval limits. The policies are reviewed and approved annually by the Company's Board of Directors. In 2012, the Company established a reserve for purchased receivable losses. Purchased receivables are recorded on the balance sheet net of this reserve.\nPurchased receivable balances increased at December 31, 2017 to $22.2 million from $20.5 million at December 31, 2016, and year-to-date average purchased receivable balances were $15.9 million, $13.3 million, and $13.4 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 is attributable to increased average balances, as well as higher yields. Purchased receivable income was $3.0 million, $2.3 million, and $2.3 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding changes in the purchased receivable reserve for the years indicated:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Charge-offs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Recoveries\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net recoveries (charge-offs)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for (recovery from) purchased receivables\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(138\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of net charge-offs (recoveries) to average purchased receivables during the period\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(0.23\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits\nDeposits are our primary source of funds.

At December 31, 2017, we had $100.5 million in certificates of deposit, of which $66.0 million, or 66%, are scheduled to mature in 2018. The Company's certificates of deposit decreased to $100.5 million during 2017 as compared to $131.7 million at December 31, 2016. The aggregate amount of certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $61.4 million and $85.5 million, respectively.

The CDARS system was founded in 2003 and allows participating banks to exchange FDIC insurance coverage so that 100% of the balance of their customers' certificates of deposit is fully subject to FDIC insurance. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had nothing in CDARS certificates of deposit.\nBorrowings\nFHLB: The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the \"FHLB\"). As a member, the Bank is eligible to obtain advances from the FHLB. FHLB advances are dependent on the availability of acceptable collateral such as marketable securities or real estate loans, although all FHLB advances are secured by a blanket pledge of the Company's assets. At December 31, 2017, our maximum borrowing line from the FHLB was $531.7 million, approximately 35% of the Company's assets, subject to the FHLB's collateral requirements. The Company has outstanding advances of $7.4 million as of December 31, 2017 which were originated to match fund low income housing projects that qualify for long term fixed interest rates. The first advance is a $2.2 million FHLB Community Investment Program advance which was originated on March 22, 2013. It has an eighteen year term with a 30 year amortization period, which mirrors the term of the term real estate loan made to the borrower, and a fixed rate of 3.12%. The second advance is a $2.3 million FHLB Community Investment Cash Advance Program advance that was originated in the second quarter of 2016. This advance has a 20 year term with a 30 year amortization period, which mirrors the term of the term real estate loan made to the borrower, and a fixed interest rate of 2.61%. The last advance is a $3.1 million FHLB Community Investment Cash Advance Program advance that was originated in the third quarter of 2017. This advance has a 20 year term with a 30 year amortization period and a fixed interest rate of 3.25%, which mirrors the term of the loan made to the borrower. All of these FHLB advances are included in borrowings.\nFederal Reserve Bank: The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the \"Federal Reserve Bank\") is holding $73.6 million of loans as collateral to secure advances made through the discount window on December 31, 2017. There were no discount window advances outstanding at December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nOther Short-term Borrowings: Securities sold under agreements to repurchase were $27.7 million and $27.6 million, for December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The average balance outstanding of securities sold under agreements to repurchase during 2017 and 2016 was $29.0 million and $27.2 million, respectively, and the maximum outstanding at any month-end was $32.6 million and $30.5 million, respectively, during the same time periods. The securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the FHLB under the Company's control.\nThe Company is subject to provisions under Alaska state law which generally limits the amount of outstanding debt to 15% of total assets or $225.8 million and $227.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLong-term Borrowings: The Company had no long-term borrowings outstanding other than the FHLB advance noted above as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table references contractual obligations of the Company for the periods

If a benefit payment schedule is established, payments are recorded in the corresponding dates listed in the table above. Unscheduled payments for all remaining benefits are recorded \"Over 5 Years\". Additional information about employee benefit plans is provided in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.\nThe table above does not include interest payments.\nShort and long-term borrowings included in the table above are described in the \"Borrowings\" section above. Junior subordinated debentures include $8.2 million that was originated on May 8, 2003, was redeemed on August 15, 2017, and bore interest at a rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 3.15%, adjusted quarterly, and $10.3 million that was originated on December 16, 2005, matures on March 15, 2036, and bears interest at a rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 1.37%, adjusted quarterly. The Company entered into an interest rate swap in the third quarter of 2017 to hedge the variability in cash flows arising out of its junior subordinated debentures, by swapping the cash flows with an interest rate swap which receives floating and pays fixed. The Company has designated this interest rate swap as a hedging instrument. The interest rate swap effectively fixes the Company's interest payments on the $10 million of junior subordinated debentures held under NST2 at 3.72% through its maturity date. Operating lease obligations are more fully described in Note 17 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Other long-term liabilities consist of amounts that the Company owes for its investments in Delaware limited partnerships that develop low-income housing projects throughout the United States. The Company purchased a $10.7 million interest in R4 Frontier Housing Partners L.P., Coronado Park Senior Village L.P. (\"R4-Coronado\") in March 2013. The investment in R4-Coronado is expected to be fully funded in 2029. The Company also purchased an $8.5 million interest in R4 Frontier Housing Partners L.P., Mountain View Village V L.P. (\"R4-MVV\") in May 2014. The investment in R4-MVV was 97% funded by the end of 2017 and is expected to be fully funded in 2030. The Company also purchased a $6.8 million interest in R4 Frontier Housing Partners L.P., PJ33 L.P. (\"R4-PJ33\") in June 2016. The investment in R4-PJ33 is expected to be 95% funded by the end of 2018 and fully funded in 2032.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. Among the off-balance sheet items entered into in the ordinary course of business are commitments to extend credit, commitments to originate loans held for sale and the issuance of letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the balance sheet. Certain commitments are collateralized. We apply the same credit standards to these commitments as in all of our lending activities and include these commitments in our lending risk evaluations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to extend credit of $283.9 million which were not reflected on our balance sheet compared to $236.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers. These commitments have specified interest rates and generally have fixed expiration dates but may be terminated by the Company if certain conditions of the contract are violated. Collateral held relating to these commitments varies, but generally includes real estate, inventory, accounts receivable, and equipment. Our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, these total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to originate loans held for sale of $43.6 million, which were not reflected in the balance sheet compared to $62.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mortgage loans sold to investors may be sold with servicing rights released, for which the Company makes only standard legal representations and warranties as to meeting certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards. In the past two years, the Company has had to repurchase one loan due to deficiencies in underwriting or loan documentation and has not realized significant losses related to this repurchase. Management currently believes that any liabilities that may result from such recourse provisions are not significant.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had standby letters of credit of $7.6 million which were not reflected on our balance sheet compared to $9.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Credit risk arises in these transactions from the possibility that a customer may not be able to repay the Company upon default of performance. Collateral held for standby letters of credit is based on an individual evaluation of each customer's creditworthiness.\nOur total unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2017, which includes commitments to extend credit, commitments to originate loans held for sale and standby letters of credit, were $335.1 million, compared to $309.0 million as of December 31, 2016. We do not expect that all of these commitments are likely to be fully drawn upon at any one time. The Company has established reserves of $152,000 and $122,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for losses related to these commitments that are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nAdditional information regarding Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements is included in Notes 17 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is from dividends received from the Bank. Such dividends arise from the cash flow and earnings of the Bank. Banking regulations and regulatory authorities may limit the amount of, or require the Bank to obtain certain approvals before paying, dividends to the Company. Given that the Bank currently meets and the Bank anticipates that they will continue to meet, all applicable capital adequacy requirements for a well-capitalized\u201d institution by regulatory standards, the Company expects to continue to receive dividends from the Bank during 2018. A requirement to have a conservation buffer began being phased-in in 2016 and this requirement could adversely affect the Bank's ability to pay dividends.\nThe Bank manages its liquidity through its Asset and Liability Committee. Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits and advances from the FHLB. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, other borrowed funds, retained earnings, and equity are used to make loans, to acquire securities and other assets, and to fund deposit flows and continuing operations. The primary sources of demands on our liquidity are customer demands for withdrawal of deposits and borrowers' demands that we advance funds against unfunded lending commitments. Our total unfunded commitments to fund loans, loans held for sale, and letters of credit at December 31, 2017, were $335.1 million. We do not expect that all of these loans are likely to be fully drawn upon at any one time. Additionally, as noted above, our total deposits at December 31, 2017, were $1.3 billion.\nAs shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, net cash provided by operating activities was $19.3 million, $20.1 million, and $10.6 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively. The primary source of cash provided by operating activities for all periods presented was positive net income in each of these periods. The primary reason that net cash provided by operating\nactivities decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016 was that the Company had a net proceeds of $17.8 million in 2017 compared to $32.4 million in 2016 from sales of loans held for sale. Net cash of $30.4 million was provided by investing activities in 2017 as the Company's proceeds from security sales, maturities, and calls were greater than funds used to purchase additional investment securities in 2017. $47.5 million and $63.5 million of cash were used in investing activities in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as the Company invested available cash primarily in available for sale securities and portfolio loans. Financing activities used cash of $22.4 million in 2017, and provided cash of $19.3 million, and $42.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Financing activities used net cash in 2017 as compared to providing cash in 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in deposit balances in 2017 compared to 2016, as well as the use of cash to redeem $8.2 million in junior subordinated debt in 2017.\nThe sources by which we meet the liquidity needs of our customers are current assets and borrowings available through our correspondent banking relationships and our credit lines with the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. At December 31, 2017, our current assets were $466.6 million and our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were $593.4 million. Given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs, we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient in the foreseeable future.\nDuring 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per common share for the first and second quarters and $0.22 per common share for the third and fourth quarters. These dividends were made pursuant to our existing dividend policy and in consideration of, among other things, earnings, regulatory capital levels, liquidity, asset quality, and the overall payout ratio. We expect that the dividend rate will be reassessed on a quarterly basis by the Board of Directors in accordance with the dividend policy. The payment of cash dividends is subject to regulatory limitations as described under the Supervision and Regulation section of Part I of this report. There is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased.\nOn February 22, 2018, the Board of Directors approved payment of a $0.24 per share dividend on March 16, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 8, 2018. This dividend is consistent with the Company's dividends that were declared and paid in 2017.\nIn September 2002, our Board of Directors approved a plan whereby we would periodically repurchase for cash up to approximately 5% of our shares of common stock in the open market. We purchased an aggregate of 688,442 shares of our stock under this program through December 31, 2009 at a total cost of $14.2 million at an average price of $20.65, which left a balance of 227,242 shares available under the stock repurchase program. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares in 2010 through 2016. In 2017, we purchased an aggregate of 58,341 shares at an average price of $27.56, which leaves a balance of 168,901 shares available under the stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2017.

These securities carried an interest rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 3.15% per annum that was initially set at 4.45% adjusted quarterly. The securities had a maturity date of May 15, 2033, and were callable by the Company on or after May 15, 2008. These securities were treated as Tier 1 capital by the Company's regulators for capital adequacy calculations. The Company redeemed these trust preferred securities on August 15, 2017. The interest cost to the Company of the trust preferred securities was $219,000 in 2017.\nOn December 16, 2005, the Company's subsidiary, NST2, issued trust preferred securities in the principal amount of $10 million. These securities carry an interest rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 1.37% per annum that was initially set at 5.86% adjusted quarterly. The securities have a maturity date of March 15, 2036, and are callable by the Company on or after March 15, 2011. These securities are treated as Tier 1 capital by the Company's regulators for capital adequacy calculations. The interest cost to the Company of these securities was $268,000 in 2017. At December 31, 2017, the securities had an interest rate of 2.96%. The\nCompany entered into an interest rate swap in the third quarter of 2017 to hedge the variability in cash flows arising out of its junior subordinated debentures, by swapping the cash flows with an interest rate swap which receives floating and pays fixed. The Company has designated this interest rate swap as a hedging instrument. The interest rate swap effectively fixes the Company's interest payments on the $10 million of junior subordinated debentures held under NST2 at 3.72% through its maturity date.\nOur shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017, was $192.8 million, as compared to $186.7 million at December 31, 2016. The Company earned net income of $13.2 million during 2017 and issued 32,414 shares through the exercise of stock options. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 6.9 million shares of its common stock outstanding.\nWe are subject to minimum capital requirements. Federal banking agencies have adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies. The requirements address both risk-based capital and leverage capital. We believe as of December 31, 2017, that the Company and the Bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements for a well-capitalized\u201d institution by regulatory standards.\nThe table below illustrates the capital requirements in effect in 2017 for the Company and the Bank and the actual capital ratios for each entity that exceed these requirements. Management intends to maintain capital ratios for the Bank in 2018, exceeding the FDIC's new requirements for the well-capitalized\u201d classification. The capital ratios for the Company exceed those for the Bank primarily because the $8 million trust preferred securities offering that the Company completed in the second quarter of 2003 and redeemed in the third quarter of 2017 and another offering of $10 million completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 are included in the Company's capital for regulatory purposes, although they are accounted for as a long-term debt in our financial statements. The trust preferred securities are not accounted for on the Bank's financial statements nor are they included in its capital. As a result, the Company has $10 million and $18 million more in regulatory capital than the Bank at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which explains most of the difference in the capital ratios for the two entities.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Minimum Required Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Well-Capitalized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual Ratio Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual Ratio Bank\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total risk-based capital\n</td> <td>8.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.90%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.08%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 risk-based capital\n</td> <td>6.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.65%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.83%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier 1 capital\n</td> <td>4.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.89%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.83%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage ratio\n</td> <td>4.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.41%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.87%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the capital ratios. The requirements for \"well-capitalized\" come from the Prompt Correction Action rules. See Item 1 Supervision and Regulation. These rules apply to the Bank but not to the Company. Under the rules of the Federal Reserve Bank, a bank holding company such as the Company is generally defined to be \"well capitalized\" if its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 8.0% or more and its total risk-based capital ratio is 10.0% or more.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices: The primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates, which could affect the degree and timing of the repricing of our assets and liabilities. In addition, inflation has an impact on our customers' ability to repay their loans.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion highlights key information as determined by management but may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding, the following should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 included elsewhere in this report.\nThis annual report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nExecutive Overview\nNet income attributable to the Company decreased 9% to $13.2 million or $1.88 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $14.4 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Significant items contributing to the decline in 2017 compared to 2016 were:\n \u2022 the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets to comply with recently enacted federal tax legislation, \n \u2022 a decline in net income attributable to the Company in the Home Mortgage Lending segment due primarily to the relative general weakness of the Alaska economy and a writedown in the carrying value of the Company's minority ownership interest in a mortgage origination business owned by RML, \n \u2022 an increase in the provision for loan losses mostly as a result of an increase in nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, as well as an increase in the portion of the allowance for loan losses specific to impaired loans, \n \u2022 one-time costs associated with the conversion of the Company's core system, and \n \u2022 an increase in expenses associated with OREO, net of gains on the sale of OREO and rental income on OREO properties. \nThese items were partially offset by a $4.4 million gain recognized on the sale of the assets of NBG and a decrease in compensation expense for acquisition payments related to the Company's 2014 acquisition of RML.\nThe following are other significant items for the year ended December 31, 2017:\n \u2022 Total revenues, which include net interest income plus other operating income, decreased 1% to $98.2 million in 2017 from $99.6 million in 2016. This decrease mainly reflects decreased mortgage banking income, which was partially offset by the gain on the sale of the assets of NBG. \n \u2022 Average portfolio loans increased slightly to $981.0 million in 2017 compared to $976.6 in 2016, primarily reflecting growth in the commercial and construction loan portfolios which was partially offset by a decrease in the commercial real estate loan portfolio. \n \u2022 The provision for loan losses increased in 2017 to $3.2 million from $2.3 million in 2016. We experienced net charge-offs of $1.4 million in 2017 as compared to $754,000 in 2016; additionally, nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, increased to $21.4 million at the end of 2017 compared to $12.9 million at the end of 2016, while total adversely classified loans, net of government guarantees at December 31, 2017 decreased from $35.6 million at December 31, 2016 to $33.8 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses ( Allowance\u201d) totaled 2.25% of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2017, compared to 2.02% at December 31, 2016. The Allowance compared to nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, decreased to 100% at December 31, 2017 from 152% at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 The Company continued to maintain strong capital ratios with Tier 1 Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets of 14.65% at December 31, 2017 as compared to 14.54% at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Book value per share increased 3.7% to $28.06 per share at December 31, 2017 compared to $27.07 per share at December 31, 2016 while tangible book value increased 4.0% to $25.70 per share at December 31, 2017, compared to $24.70 per share at December 31, 2016. Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP ratio defined as shareholders' equity, less intangible assets, divided by common shares outstanding. Management believes that tangible book value is a useful measurement of the value of the Company's equity because it excludes the effect of intangible assets on the Company's equity. See reconciliation to book value per share, the most comparable GAAP measurement under \"Selected Financial Data - Reconciliation of Selected Financial Data to GAAP Financial Measures\" in this report. \n \u2022 The aggregate cash dividends paid by the Company in 2017, rose 10% to $0.86 per diluted share from $0.78 per diluted share paid in 2016. \n \u2022 The Company repurchased 58,341 shares of its common stock in the third quarter of 2017 at an average price of $27.56 per share, leaving 168,901 shares available under the previously announced repurchase authorization. \n \u2022 The Company redeemed $8.0 million in junior subordinated debt held at Northrim Capital Trust 1. This liability bore interest at a floating rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 3.15%, or 4.33% at the time it was redeemed, and had a final maturity \nof May 15, 2033. In 2016, total interest expense on this debt was $310,000. Interest expense on this debt in 2017 through the date of redemption on August 15, 2017 was $212,000. This redemption decreased Tier 1 Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets and Total Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets by 62 basis points each.\n \u2022 An interest rate swap executed in September 2017 effectively converts the floating rate of interest on the remaining $10.0 million in outstanding junior subordinated debt from 90-day LIBOR plus 1.37%, or 2.96% as of December 31, 2017, to a fixed rate of 3.72% through the junior subordinated debt's final maturity date of March 15, 2036.  Critical Accounting Policies\nThe SEC defines \"critical accounting policies\" as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the SEC's definition.\nAllowance for loan losses: The Company maintains an Allowance to reflect inherent losses in its loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company performs regular credit reviews of the loan portfolio to determine the credit quality and adherence to underwriting standards. When loans are originated, they are assigned a risk rating that is reassessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process. The Company's risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from 1 to 10, where a higher rating represents higher risk. These risk ratings are then consolidated into five classes, which include pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. These classes are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan losses. Each class is assessed an inherent credit loss factor that determines an amount of allowance for loan losses provided for that group of loans. This allowance is then adjusted for qualitative factors, by segment and class. Qualitative factors are based on management's assessment of current trends that may cause losses inherent in the current loan portfolio to differ significantly from historical losses. Some factors that management considers in determining the qualitative adjustment to the general reserve include loan quality trends in our own portfolio, the degree of concentrations of large borrowers in our loan portfolio, national and local economic trends, business conditions, underwriting policies and standards, trends in local real estate markets, effects of various political activities, peer group data, and internal factors such as underwriting policies and expertise of the Company's employees.\nRegular credit reviews of the portfolio also identify loans that are considered potentially impaired. A loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events, we determine that we will probably not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract, including scheduled interest payments. When we identify a loan as impaired, we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows, except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral. In these cases, we use the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, instead of discounted cash flows. The analysis of collateral dependent loans includes appraisals on loans secured by real property, management's assessment of the current market, recent payment history and an evaluation of other sources of repayment. The Company obtains appraisals on real and personal property that secure its loans during the loan origination process in accordance with regulatory guidance and its loan policy. The Company obtains updated appraisals on loans secured by real or personal property based upon its assessment of changes in the current market or particular projects or properties, information from other current appraisals and other sources of information. The Company uses the information provided in these updated appraisals along with its evaluation of all other information available on a particular property as it assesses the collateral coverage on its performing and nonperforming loans and the impact that may have on the adequacy of its Allowance.\nIf we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we either recognize an impairment reserve as a specific component to be provided for in the Allowance or charge-off the impaired balance on collateral dependent loans if it is determined that such amount represents a confirmed loss. The combination of the risk rating-based allowance component and the impairment reserve allowance component lead to an allocated allowance for loan losses.\nFinally, the Company assesses the overall adequacy of the Allowance based on several factors including the level of the Allowance as compared to total loans and nonperforming loans in light of current economic conditions. This portion of the Allowance is deemed unallocated\u201d because it is not allocated to any segment or class of the loan portfolio. This portion of the Allowance provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the credit loss factors that are utilized in the risk rating-based component or in the specific impairment component of the Allowance and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models.\nThe unallocated portion of the Allowance is based upon management's evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the allocated portions of the Allowance. Such factors include uncertainties in identifying triggering events that directly correlate to subsequent loss rates, uncertainties in economic conditions, risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors, and historical loss experience data that may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio. In addition, the unallocated reserve may fluctuate based upon the direction of various risk indicators. Examples of such factors include the risk as to current and prospective economic conditions, the level and trend of charge offs or recoveries, and the risk of heightened imprecision or inconsistency of appraisals used in estimating real estate values. Although this allocation process may not accurately predict credit losses by loan type or in aggregate, the total allowance for credit losses is available to absorb losses that may arise from any loan type or category. Due to the subjectivity involved in the determination of the unallocated portion of the Allowance, the relationship of the unallocated component to the total Allowance may fluctuate from period to period.\nBased on our methodology and its components, management believes the resulting Allowance is adequate and appropriate for the risk identified in the Company's loan portfolio. Given current processes employed by the Company, management believes the segments, classes, and estimated loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be material to the Company's financial statements. In addition, current loan classes and fair value estimates of collateral are subject to change as we continue to review loans within our portfolio and as our borrowers are impacted by economic trends within their market areas. Although we have established an Allowance that we consider adequate, there can be no assurance that the established Allowance will be sufficient to offset losses on loans in the future. In addition, a substantial percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate; as a result, a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the Allowance.\nValuation of goodwill and other intangibles: Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment. Management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis as of December 31. Additionally, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists. The impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures, technology, changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions. There can be no assurance that changes in circumstances, estimates or assumptions may result in additional impairment of all, or some portion of, goodwill or other intangible assets. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing at December 31, 2017 and 2016 in accordance with the policy described in Note 1 to the financial statements included with this report. At December 31, 2017, the Company performed its annual impairment test by performing the first step of the comprehensive impairment analysis. The Company estimated the fair value of the Company using four valuation methodologies including a comparable transactions approach, a control premium approach, a public market peers approach and a discounted cash flow approach. We then compared the estimated fair value of the Company to the carrying value and concluded that no potential impairment existed as of December 31, 2017.\nValuation of OREO: OREO represents properties acquired through foreclosure or its equivalent. Prior to foreclosure, the carrying value is adjusted to the fair value, less cost to sell, of the real estate to be acquired by an adjustment to the allowance for loan loss. The amount by which the fair value less cost to sell is greater than the carrying amount of the loan plus amounts previously charged off is recognized in earnings. Any subsequent reduction in the carrying value is charged against earnings. Management's evaluation of fair value is based on appraisals or discounted cash flows of anticipated sales. The amounts ultimately recovered from the sale of OREO may differ from the carrying value of the assets because of market factors beyond the Company's control or due to changes in the Company's strategies for recovering the investment.\nMortgage servicing rights: The Company measures mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\") at fair value on a recurring basis and reports changes in fair value through earnings in mortgage banking income in the period in which the change occurs. Fair value adjustments encompass market-driven valuation changes and the decrease in value that occurs from the passage of time, which are separately reported. Retained MSRs are measured at fair value as of the date of sale. Initial and subsequent fair value measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model. In order to determine the fair value of the MSR, the present value of expected net future cash flows is estimated. Assumptions used include market discount rates, anticipated prepayment speeds, escrow calculations, delinquency rates and ancillary fee income net of servicing costs. The model assumptions are also compared to publicly filed information from several large MSR holders, as available.\nFair Value: A hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability is utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Pricing observability is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIncome Statement\nNet Income\nOur results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income. We also generate other income primarily through mortgage banking income, purchased receivables products, sales of employee benefit plans (through August of 2017, when we sold the assets of NBG), service charges and fees, bankcard fees and rental income. Our operating expenses consist in large part of salaries and other personnel costs, occupancy, data processing, marketing, and professional services expenses and compensation expense for RML acquisition payments. Interest income and cost of funds, or interest expense, are affected significantly by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, by government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities and by competition in our markets.\nWe earned net income attributable to the Company of $13.2 million in 2017, compared to net income of $14.4 million in 2016, and $17.8 million in 2015. During these periods, net income per diluted share was $1.88, $2.06, and $2.56, respectively. The decrease in net income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase of $4.3 million in provision for income taxes and an increase of $902,000 in the provision for loan losses, as well as a decrease of $2.8 million in other operating income, which was primarily driven by a reduction in mortgage banking income. These changes were only partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in net interest income and a $4.6 million decrease in compensation expense - RML acquisition payments in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in net income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $2.9 million in salaries and other personnel expense and an increase of $554,000 in the provision for loan losses, as well as decreases of $1.3 million and $552,000 in other operating income and net interest income, respectively, in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nNet Interest Income / Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income from loan and investment securities portfolios and interest expense on customer deposits and borrowings. Net interest income in 2017 was $57.7 million, compared to $56.4 million in 2016, and $56.9 million in 2015. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was mainly due to increased interest income earned on long- and short-term investments and loans primarily due to higher yields in 2017 compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to decreased interest income earned on loans and loans held for sale mainly due to lower yields, which was only partially offset by increased interest income on long-term investments due to higher balances.\nChanges in net interest income result from changes in volume and spread, which in turn affect our margin. For this purpose, volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Changes in net interest income are influenced by yields and the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, net interest margins were 4.22%, 4.14%, and 4.27%, respectively. The increase in the net interest margin in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily the result of higher yields on all interest-earning assets. The decrease in net interest margin in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily the result of lower yields on portfolio loans as well as an unfavorable change in the mix of interest-earning assets as average portfolio loans decreased as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. The Company intends to continue to implement strategies designed to grow our loan portfolio, while actively managing non-performing assets, to offset the negative effect that today's relatively low interest rates have on our net interest margin.\nThe following table sets forth for the periods indicated information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities, as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Average yields or costs, net interest income, and net interest margin are also presented:\n\n1Interest income includes loan fees. Loan fees recognized during the period and included in the yield calculation totaled $3.2 million, $3.1 million and $3.5 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n2Nonaccrual loans are included with a zero effective yield. Average nonaccrual loans included in the computation of the average loans were $18.1 million, $7.2 million, and $4.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n3Consists of investment securities available for sale, investment securities held to maturity, and investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock.\n4Consists of interest bearing deposits in other banks and domestic CDs.\nThe following table sets forth the changes in consolidated net interest income attributable to changes in volume and to changes in interest rates. Changes attributable to the combined effect of volume and interest rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to interest rate:\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses in 2017 of $3.2 million, compared to $2.3 million and $1.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The loan loss provision increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in nonperforming loans and an increase in the portion of the Allowance specific to impaired loans in 2017 compared to 2016. The loan loss provision increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in nonperforming loans as well as increases in qualitative factors mostly due to softening in the Alaskan economy in 2016 compared to 2015. See the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section under Financial Condition\u201d and Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of these decreases and changes in the Company's Allowance.\nOther Operating Income\nThe following table details the major components of other operating income for the years ended December 31:\n\n2017 Compared to 2016\nThe most significant changes in other operating income in 2017 were decreases in mortgage banking income and employee benefit plan income, which were partially offset by a $4.4 million gain on the sale of the assets of NBG. Mortgage banking income, which is the largest component of other operating income and represented 58% of total other operating income in 2017 and consists of gross income from the origination and sale of mortgages as well as mortgage loan servicing fees, decreased to $23.3 million in 2017 from $29.5 million in 2016, mainly due to lower mortgage production revenue resulting from lower realized gains on the sale of mortgage loans, which was partially offset by increased mortgage servicing revenue. The overall decline in mortgage banking income is primarily the result of the slowing of the Alaskan economy. Employee benefit plan income decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the sale of the assets of NBG in August 2017. Lastly, purchased receivable income increased mostly due to higher yields and balances in 2017 compared to 2016 and service charges on deposit accounts decreased primarily due to lower non-sufficient funds fees.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nThe most significant changes in other operating income in 2016 were a decrease in gains on the disposition of loans acquired in the APB transaction at a discount to par values and in gains on the sale of investment securities. Mortgage banking income, which is the largest component of other operating income and represented 68% of total other operating income in 2016 and consists of gross income from the origination and sale of mortgages as well as mortgage loan servicing fees, decreased slightly to $29.5 million in 2016 from $29.6 million in 2015 mainly due to lower mortgage production revenue resulting from lower realized gains on the sale of mortgage loans and the change in fair value of mortgage loan commitments, which was mostly offset by increased mortgage servicing revenue. Service charges on deposit accounts also decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 in part due to lower non-sufficient funds fees. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in employee benefit plan income mostly due to growth in NBG's core business operations, higher other loan fees due to increased commercial loan servicing revenue, and higher purchased receivable income mostly due to higher yields in 2016 compared to 2015 .\nOther Operating Expense\nThe following table details the major components of other operating expense for the years ended December 31:\n\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOther operating expense decreased in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased costs in compensation expense - RML acquisition payments and salaries and other personnel expense, and, to a lesser extent, professional and outside services expense and loss on sale of premises and equipment. Compensation expense - RML acquisition payments decreased $4.6 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 due in part to the fact that 2016 included a $2.3 million non-cash error correction that covered the period from December 1, 2014, through June 30, 2016. The remainder of the decrease in compensation expense - RML acquisition payments resulted from a decrease in net income from RML. Salaries and other personnel expense decreased primarily due to lower originator commission expense in the home mortgage lending segment due to lower home mortgage loan originations. These decreases were partially offset by increases in impairment on OREO expense and data processing expense in 2017 compared to 2016. Impairment on OREO increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to writedowns on two OREO properties resulting from a decrease in sales price assumptions. Data processing expense increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 mostly due to higher software amortization and maintenance expense.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nOther operating expense increased in 2016 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased costs in salaries and other personnel expense and compensation expense - RML acquisition payments, and, to a lesser extent, data processing expense, occupancy expense and professional and outside services. Salaries and other personnel expenses increased on an approximately equal basis in both the community banking segment and home mortgage lending segment in 2016. Salaries and other personnel expense related to the operations of the community banking segment increased $1.4 million mainly due to higher medical costs and increases in various other benefits costs, as well as normal cost of living and performance based annual salary increases. The home mortgage lending segment had an increase in salaries and other personnel expense primarily attributable to an increase in full-time equivalent employees for new management and marketing positions and the addition of a new location in Wasilla. While compensation expense - RML acquisition payments increased $681,000 in 2016 as compared to 2015. This expense item in 2016 included a $2.3 million non-cash error correction that covered the period from December 1, 2014, through June 30, 2016. Additionally, the change in the accounting treatment of these payments also increased compensation expense - RML acquisition payments in the third and fourth quarters of 2016. The total increase in compensation expense - RML acquisition payments in 2016 resulting from the error correction and prospective change in accounting was $3.0 million. These increases were partially offset by slight decreases in insurance expense and marketing expense in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes increased $4.3 million or 71%, to $10.3 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 and decreased $2.7 million or 31%, to $6.1 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 includes $2.7 million in expense for the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset resulting from a decrease in the corporate tax rate included in federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017. Additionally, the changes in total income tax expense for these periods are due primarily to the 13% increase in income before income taxes in 2017 compared to the previous year and a 22% decrease in income before income taxes in 2016 compared to 2015. Additionally, the Company's effective tax rates were 43%, 29%, and 32% in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 is mainly due to the increase in expense resulting from the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax asset. The decrease in effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 is mainly due to higher tax credits and tax-exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax income in 2016 as compared to 2015. The Company believes its effective tax rate will decline to between 19% and 20% due to the new federal tax legislation in 2018.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nInvestment Securities\nThe composition of our investment securities portfolio reflects management's investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of interest income. The investment securities portfolio also mitigates interest rate and credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio, while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, a source of liquidity (by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreements), and collateral for certain public funds deposits. Investment securities designated as available for sale comprised 100% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and are available to meet liquidity requirements.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of government sponsored entity securities, corporate securities, and municipal securities. Investment securities at December 31, 2017 decreased $19.4 million, or 6%, to $312.8 million from $332.1 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016 is primarily due to a portion of the proceeds from sales, maturities, and security calls being held in short-term investment funds at December 31, 2017. The average maturity of the investment portfolio was approximately two years at December 31, 2017.\nInvestment securities may be pledged as collateral to secure public deposits or borrowings. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $51.6 million and $50.9 million in securities were pledged for deposits and borrowings, respectively. Pledged securities decreased at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016 because the Company had decreased balances in tri-party accounts at December 31, 2017.\nThe following tables set forth the composition of our investment portfolio at December 31 for the years indicated:\n\nThe following table sets forth the market value, maturities, and weighted average pretax yields of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017:\n\nThe Company's investment in preferred stock does not have a maturity date but it has been included in the over 10 years column above. At December 31, 2017, we held no securities of any single issuer (other than government sponsored entities) that exceeded 10% of our shareholders' equity.\nLoans\nOur loan products include short and medium-term commercial loans, commercial credit lines, construction and real estate loans, and consumer loans. To a lesser extent, through our wholly-owned subsidiary RML, we also originate mortgage loans which we sell to the secondary market. We also retain servicing rights on mortgage loans originated by RML and sold to the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (\"AHFC\"). We emphasize providing financial services to small and medium-sized businesses and to individuals. From our inception, we have emphasized commercial, land development and home construction, and commercial real estate lending. These types of lending have provided us with needed market opportunities and generally provide higher net interest margins compared to other types of lending such as consumer lending. However, they also involve greater risks, including greater exposure to changes in local economic conditions.\nAll of our loans and credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations. These limitations apply to the borrower's total outstanding indebtedness and commitments to us, including the indebtedness of any guarantor. Generally, we are permitted to make loans to one borrower of up to 15% of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the Bank. The loan-to-one-borrower limitation for the Bank was $27.5 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, the Company had two relationships whose total direct and indirect commitments exceeded $27.5 million; however, no individual direct relationship exceeded the loans-to-one borrower limitation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Provision for Loan Losses\u201d for further discussion of the Company's concentration of loans to large borrowers.\nOur lending operations are guided by loan policies, which outline the basic policies and procedures by which lending operations are conducted. Generally, the policies address our desired loan types, target markets, underwriting and collateral requirements, terms, interest rate and yield considerations, and compliance with laws and regulations. The policies are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors of the Bank. Our Quality Assurance Department provides a detailed financial analysis of our largest, most complex loans. In addition, the Quality Assurance Department, along with the Senior Credit Officer of the Bank and others in the Loan Administration department, have developed processes to analyze and manage various\nconcentrations of credit within the overall loan portfolio. The Loan Administration Department monitors the procedures and processes for both the analysis and reporting of problem loans, and also develops strategies to resolve problem loans based on the facts and circumstances for each loan. Finally, our Internal Audit Department also performs an independent review of each loan portfolio for compliance with loan policy as well as a review of credit quality. The Internal Audit review follows the FDIC sampling guidelines, and a review of each portfolio is performed on an annual basis.\nThe Company acquired $138.4 million in loans in connection with the acquisition of APB on April 1, 2014. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio by loan segment:\n\nCommercial Loans: Our commercial loan portfolio includes both secured and unsecured loans for working capital and expansion. Short-term working capital loans generally are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, or equipment. We also make longer-term commercial loans secured by equipment and real estate. We also make commercial loans that are guaranteed in large part by the Small Business Administration or the Bureau of Indian Affairs and to a lesser extent guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture, as well as commercial real estate loans that are purchased by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority ( AIDEA\u201d). Commercial loans increased to $313.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $278.2 million at December 31, 2016 and represented approximately 33% and 29% of our total loans outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Commercial loans reprice more frequently than other types of loans, such as real estate loans. More frequent repricing means that interest cash flows from commercial loans are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, our philosophy is to emphasize the pricing of loans on a floating rate basis, which allows these loans to reprice more frequently and to contribute positively to our net interest margin.\nCommercial Real Estate: We are an active lender in the commercial real estate market. At December 31, 2017, commercial real estate loans decreased to $492.0 million from $554.2 million at December 31, 2016, and represented approximately 51% and 57% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. These loans are typically secured by office buildings, apartment complexes or warehouses. Loan amortization periods range from 10 to 25 years and generally have a maximum maturity of 10 years.\nWe may sell all or a portion of a commercial real estate loan to two State of Alaska entities, AIDEA and AHFC, which were both established to provide long-term financing in the State of Alaska. The loans that AIDEA purchases typically feature a maturity twice that of the loans retained by us and bear a lower interest rate. The blend of our and AIDEA's loan terms allows us to provide competitive long-term financing to our customers, while reducing the risk inherent in this type of lending. We also originate and sell to AHFC loans secured by multifamily residential units. Typically, 100% of these loans are sold to AHFC and we provide ongoing servicing of the loans for a fee. AIDEA and AHFC make it possible for us to originate these commercial real estate loans and enhance fee income while reducing our exposure to interest rate risk.\nConstruction Loans: We provide construction lending for commercial real estate projects. Such loans generally are made only when the Company has also committed to finance the completed project with a commercial real estate loan, or if there is a firm take-out commitment upon completion of the project by a third party lender. Additionally, we provide land development and residential subdivision construction loans. We also originate one-to-four-family residential and condominium construction loans to builders for construction of homes. The Company's construction loans increased in 2017 to $111.3 million, up from $98.2\nmillion in 2016, and represented approximately 12% and 10% of our loan portfolio in December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $30.5 million or 27%, of the Company's construction loans were for low income housing tax credit projects as compared to $31.7 million or 32% as of December 31, 2016.\nConsumer Loans: We provide personal loans for automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats, and other larger consumer purchases. We provide both secured and unsecured consumer credit lines to accommodate the needs of our individual customers, with home equity lines of credit serving as the major product in this area.\nLoans Directly Exposed to the Oil and Gas Industry: The Company defines \"direct exposure\" to the oil and gas industry as companies that it has identified as significantly reliant upon activity related to the oil and gas industry, such as oil producers or drilling and exploration companies, and companies who provide oilfield services, lodging, equipment rental, transportation, and other logistic services specific to the industry. The Company estimates that $70.8 million, or approximately 7% of loans as of December 31, 2017 have direct exposure to the oil and gas industry as compared to $57.4 million, or approximately 6% of loans as of December 31, 2016. The Company has no loans to oil producers or drilling and exploration companies as of the end of 2017 or 2016, but the $70.8 million outstanding as of December 31, 2017 noted above does include $9.2 million related to the construction of an oil rig. The Company's unfunded commitments to borrowers that have direct exposure to the oil and gas industry were $53.5 million and $52.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The portion of the Company's allowance for loan losses that related to the loans with direct exposure to the oil and gas industry was estimated at $1.8 million and $1.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following table details loan balances by loan segment asset quality rating (\"AQR\") and class of financing receivable for loans with direct oil and gas exposure as of the dates indicated:\n\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Change in Interest Rates: The following table presents the aggregate maturity data of our loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale, at December 31, 2017:\n\nAt December 31, 2017, 62% of the portfolio was scheduled to mature or reprice in 2018 with 36% scheduled to mature or reprice between 2019 and 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 70% of commercial loans are variable rate loans, of which 70% reprice within one year. The majority of these loans reprice to an index based upon the prime rate of interest or the respective Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the \"Boston FHLB\") rate. The Company also uses floors in its commercial loan pricing as loans are originated or renewed during the year.\nAt December 31, 2017, the interest rates for approximately 89% of commercial real estate loans are variable, of which 51% reset within one year. Approximately 45% of commercial real estate variable rate loans reprice in greater than one year but within three years. The indices for these loans include the prime rate of interest or the respective Treasury or Boston FHLB rate. The Company also uses floors in its commercial real estate loan pricing as loans are originated or renewed during the year.\nLoans Held for Sale and Mortgage Servicing Rights: The Company originates residential mortgage loans and sells them in the secondary market through our wholly-owned subsidiary, RML. All residential mortgage loans originated and sold in 2017 and 2016 were newly originated loans that did not affect nonperforming loans. The Company also has a mortgage servicing portfolio which is comprised of 1-4 family loans serviced for FHLMC and AHFC. The Company retains servicing rights on all mortgage loans originated by RML and sold to AHFC. Mortgages originated by RML and sold to AHFC represent approximately 26% and 20% of the mortgages originated by RML in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Mortgage servicing rights are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in mortgage banking income. The value of mortgage servicing rights is impacted by market rates for mortgage loans primarily due to how changes in interest rates affect prepayments of mortgage loans. To the extent loans are prepaid sooner than estimated at the time servicing assets are originally recorded, it is possible that certain residential mortgage servicing rights assets may decrease in value. Generally, the fair value of our residential mortgage servicing rights are expected to increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall.\nCredit Quality and Nonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, accruing loans that are 90 days or more past due, repossessed assets and OREO. The following table sets forth information regarding our nonperforming loans and total nonperforming assets:\n\nThe Company's nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees increased in 2017 to $21.4 million as compared to $12.9 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to the addition of two borrowing relationships to nonaccrual status in 2017. There was interest income of $142,000, $181,000, and $617,000 recognized in net income for 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively, related to interest collected on nonaccrual loans whose principal has been paid down to zero. The Company had three relationships that represented more than 10% of nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company had $7.7 million and $6.1 million in loans classified as troubled debt restructuring loans (\"TDRs\") that were performing as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additionally, there were $16.2 million and $10.1 million in TDRs included in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016 for total TDRs of $23.8 million and $16.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in TDRs at December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to several additions to loans classified as TDRs that were only partially offset by paydowns on TDRs in 2017. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of TDRs.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $30.5 million in loans measured for impairment, net of government guarantees as compared to $37.0 million in loans measured for impairment, net of government guarantees at December 31, 2016. The decrease of $6.5 million is mostly attributable to the transfer of one large borrowing relationship from loans to OREO. The total amount of loans measured for impairment for this borrower was $5.9 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, management had identified potential problem loans of $9.5 million as compared to potential problem loans of $18.2 million at December 31, 2016. Potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing that have developed negative indications that the borrower may not be able to comply with present payment terms and which may later be included in nonaccrual, past due, or impaired loans. The $8.7 million decrease in potential problem loans at December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 was primarily due to one $11.4 million relationship that was upgraded and a $4.6 million relationship which moved to OREO. These decreases were partially offset by the addition of one $6.3 million relationship.\nThe following summarizes OREO activity for the periods indicated:\n\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016 the Company held $8.7 million and $6.6 million, respectively, of OREO assets. At December 31, 2017, OREO consists of $3.0 million in residential lots in various stages of development and a $5.7 million commercial building. All OREO property is located in Alaska. The Bank initiates foreclosure proceedings to recover and sell collateral pledged by a debtor to secure a loan based on various events of default and circumstances related to loans that are secured by either commercial or residential real property. These events and circumstances include delinquencies, the Company's relationship with the borrower, and the borrower's ability to repay the loan via a source other than the collateral. If the loan has not yet matured, the debtors may cure the events of default up to the time of sale to retain their interest in the collateral. Failure to cure the defaults will result in the debtor losing ownership interest in the property, which is taken by the creditor, or high bidder at a foreclosure sale.\nDuring 2017, additions to OREO totaled $5.9 million which included a $5.7 million commercial building and a $167,000 single-family residence. During 2017, the Company received approximately $3.3 million in proceeds from the sale of OREO which included $672,000 from the sale of multi-family residential units, $1.4 million from the sale of lots and land, $832,000 from the sale of single-family residences, $360,000 from the sale of a commercial building, and $33,000 from recovery of guarantees on previously disposed OREO properties. The Company recognized $391,000, $295,000, and $284,000 in gains and $19,000, $0, and $0 in losses on the sale of OREO properties in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nThe Company also recognized $0, $0, and $34,000 in gains on sales previously deferred resulting in net gains of $371,000, $295,000, and $315,000 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company had remaining accumulated deferred gains on the sale of OREO properties of $262,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company did not make any loans to facilitate the sale of OREO in 2017, 2016, or 2015. Our underwriting policies and procedures for loans to facilitate the sale of OREO are no different than our standard loan policies and procedures.\nThe Company recognized impairments of $904,000, $187,000 and $361,000 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, due to adjustments to the Company's estimate of the fair value of certain properties based on changes in estimated costs to complete the projects, decrease in expected sales prices, and changes in the Anchorage, Fairbanks, and the Southeastern Alaska real estate markets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains an Allowance to reflect management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and loan recoveries and decreased by loan charge-offs. The size of the Allowance is determined through quarterly assessments of probable estimated losses in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for making such assessments and determining the adequacy of the Allowance includes the following key elements:\n \u2022 A specific allocation for impaired loans. Management determines the fair value of the majority of these loans based on the underlying collateral values. This analysis is based upon a specific analysis for each impaired loan, including external appraisals on loans secured by real property, management's assessment of the current market, recent payment history, and an evaluation of other sources of repayment. In-house evaluations of fair value are used in the impairment analysis in some situations. Inputs to the in-house evaluation process include information about sales of comparable properties in the appropriate markets and changes in tax assessed values. The Company obtains appraisals on real and personal property that secure its loans during the loan origination process in accordance with regulatory guidance and its loan policy. The Company obtains updated appraisals on loans secured by real or personal property based upon its assessment of changes in the current market or particular projects or properties, information from other current appraisals, and other sources of information. Appraisals may be adjusted downward by the Company based on its evaluation of the facts and circumstances on a case by case basis. External appraisals may be discounted when management believes that the absorption period used in the appraisal is unrealistic, when expected liquidation costs exceed those included in the appraisal, or when management's evaluation of deteriorating market conditions warrants an adjustment. Additionally, the Company may also adjust appraisals in the above circumstances between appraisal dates. The Company uses the information provided in these updated appraisals along with its evaluation of all other information available on a particular property as it assesses the collateral coverage on its performing and nonperforming loans and the impact that may have on the adequacy of its Allowance. The specific allowance for impaired loans, as well as the overall Allowance, may increase based on the Company's assessment of updated appraisals. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the Company's estimation of impaired loans measured at fair value.  When the Company determines that a loss has occurred on an impaired loan, a charge-off equal to the difference between carrying value and fair value is recorded. If a specific allowance is deemed necessary for a loan, and then that loan is partially charged off, the loan remains classified as a nonperforming loan after the charge-off is recognized.\n \u2022 A general allocation - The Company has identified segments and classes of loans not considered impaired for purposes of establishing the general allocation allowance. The Company disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments and classes based on its assessment of how different pools of loans with like characteristics in the portfolio behave over time. This determination is based on historical experience and management's assessment of how current facts and circumstances are expected to affect the loan portfolio.  The Company first disaggregates the loan portfolio into the following eight segments: commercial, real estate construction one-to-four family, real estate construction other, real estate term owner occupied, real estate term non-owner occupied, real estate term other, consumer secured by 1st deeds of trust, and other consumer loans.\nAfter division of the loan portfolio into segments, the Company then further disaggregates each of the segments into classes. The Company has a total of five classes, which are based off of the Company's loan risk grading system known as the Asset Quality Rating ( AQR\u201d) system. The risk ratings are discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. There are five loan classes: pass (pass AQR grades, which\nare grades 1 - 6), special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. There have been no changes to these loan classes in 2017.\nAfter the portfolio has been disaggregated into segments and classes, the Company calculates a general reserve for each segment and class based on the average loss history for each segment and class. The Company utilizes a look-back period of five years in the calculation of average historical loss rates.\nAfter the Company calculates a general allocation using our loss history, the general reserve is then adjusted for qualitative factors by segment and class. Qualitative factors are based on management's assessment of current trends that may cause losses inherent in the current loan portfolio to differ significantly from historical losses. Some factors that management considers in determining the qualitative adjustment to the general reserve include our concentration of large borrowers; national and local economic trends; general business conditions; trends in local real estate markets; economic, political, and industry specific factors that affect resource development in Alaska; effects of various political activities; peer group data; and internal factors such as underwriting policies and expertise of the Company's employees.\n \u2022 An unallocated reserve - The unallocated portion of the Allowance provides for other credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the specific and general components of the Allowance, and it acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models. The unallocated component is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses and overall economic conditions. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the unallocated allowance as a percentage of the total Allowance was 16% and 7%, respectively.  The following table shows the allocation of the Allowance for the years indicated:\n\n1Represents percentage of this category of loans to total portfolio loans.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding changes in our Allowance for the years indicated:\n\nIn accordance with GAAP, loans acquired in connection with our acquisition of APB on April 1, 2014 were recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date. Credit discounts were included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses was not recorded at the acquisition date. Purchased credit impaired loans were evaluated on a loan by loan basis and the valuation allowance for these loans was netted against the carrying value. Deterioration in credit quality of the acquired loans subsequent to acquisition date results in the establishment of an allowance. Management assesses the credit impairment for the loans that were acquired in connection with the acquisition of APB as part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company's entire loan portfolio. Management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, gross and net chargeoffs, and movement in loan balances within the risk classifications. As of December 31, 2017, $629,000 of the original $141.5 million of purchased loans, or 0.44%, had migrated from pass grade loans to substandard loans. These loans are included in impaired loans as of December 31, 2017, and have been evaluated for specific impairment as part of the calculation of the Allowance. There was no specific impairment on these loans at December 31, 2017 or 2016, respectively. There was no Allowance related to acquired loans at December 31, 2017 or 2016, however, the purchase discount related to these acquired credit impaired loans was $803,000 and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe provision for loan losses in 2017 as compared to 2016 increased $902,000 to $3.2 million compared to $2.3 million in 2016. This increase is primarily due to an increase in nonperforming loans and the portion of the Allowance specific to impaired loans. The Company determined that an Allowance of $21.5 million, or 2.25% of portfolio loans, is appropriate as of December 31, 2017 based on our analysis of the current credit quality of the portfolio and current economic conditions. The provision for loan losses in 2016 as compared to 2015 increased $544,000 to $2.3 million compared to $1.8 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due an increase in nonperforming loans in 2016 compared to the prior year as well as an increase in qualitative factors mostly due to softening in the Alaska economy in 2016. The provision for loan losses in 2015 as compared to 2014 increased $2.4 million to $1.8 million compared to a benefit, or negative expense, of $636,000 in 2014. This increase was primarily due to net recoveries on loans in 2014 that led to a negative loan loss provision in that year. The provision for loan losses in 2014 as compared to 2013 was relatively flat despite an increase in net recoveries in 2014 primarily due to an increase in loan volume that same year.\nWhile management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the Allowance, unforeseen market conditions and other events could result in an adjustment to the Allowance, and net income could be significantly affected if circumstances differed substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination of the Allowance.\nPurchased Receivables\nWe purchase accounts receivable from our business customers and provide them with short-term working capital. We provide this service to our customers in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and some other states through NFS.\nOur purchased receivable activity is guided by policies that outline risk management, documentation, and approval limits. The policies are reviewed and approved annually by the Company's Board of Directors. In 2012, the Company established a reserve for purchased receivable losses. Purchased receivables are recorded on the balance sheet net of this reserve.\nPurchased receivable balances increased at December 31, 2017 to $22.2 million from $20.5 million at December 31, 2016, and year-to-date average purchased receivable balances were $15.9 million, $13.3 million, and $13.4 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 is attributable to increased average balances, as well as higher yields. Purchased receivable income was $3.0 million, $2.3 million, and $2.3 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding changes in the purchased receivable reserve for the years indicated:\n\nDeposits\nDeposits are our primary source of funds. Total deposits decreased 1% to $1.258 billion at December 31, 2017 from $1.268 billion at December 31, 2016. Our deposits generally are expected to fluctuate according to the level of our market share, economic conditions, and normal seasonal trends.\nThe following table sets forth the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of our deposits, for the periods indicated:\n\nCertificates of Deposit: The only deposit category with stated maturity dates is certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2017, we had $100.5 million in certificates of deposit, of which $66.0 million, or 66%, are scheduled to mature in 2018. The Company's certificates of deposit decreased to $100.5 million during 2017 as compared to $131.7 million at December 31, 2016. The aggregate amount of certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $61.4 million and $85.5 million, respectively. The following table sets forth the amount outstanding of certificates of deposits in amounts of $100,000 or more by time remaining until maturity and percentage of total deposits as of December 31, 2017:\n\nThe Company is also a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry System ( CDARS\u201d) which is a network of over 3,000 banks throughout the United States. The CDARS system was founded in 2003 and allows participating banks to exchange FDIC insurance coverage so that 100% of the balance of their customers' certificates of deposit is fully subject to FDIC insurance. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had nothing in CDARS certificates of deposit.\nBorrowings\nFHLB: The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the \"FHLB\"). As a member, the Bank is eligible to obtain advances from the FHLB. FHLB advances are dependent on the availability of acceptable collateral such as marketable securities or real estate loans, although all FHLB advances are secured by a blanket pledge of the Company's assets. At December 31, 2017, our maximum borrowing line from the FHLB was $531.7 million, approximately 35% of the Company's assets, subject to the FHLB's collateral requirements. The Company has outstanding advances of $7.4 million as of December 31, 2017 which were originated to match fund low income housing projects that qualify for long term fixed interest rates. The first advance is a $2.2 million FHLB Community Investment Program advance which was originated on March 22, 2013. It has an eighteen year term with a 30 year amortization period, which mirrors the term of the term real estate loan made to the borrower, and a fixed rate of 3.12%. The second advance is a $2.3 million FHLB Community Investment Cash Advance Program advance that was originated in the second quarter of 2016. This advance has a 20 year term with a 30 year amortization period, which mirrors the term of the term real estate loan made to the borrower, and a fixed interest rate of 2.61%. The last advance is a $3.1 million FHLB Community Investment Cash Advance Program advance that was originated in the third quarter of 2017. This advance has a 20 year term with a 30 year amortization period and a fixed interest rate of 3.25%, which mirrors the term of the loan made to the borrower. All of these FHLB advances are included in borrowings.\nFederal Reserve Bank: The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the \"Federal Reserve Bank\") is holding $73.6 million of loans as collateral to secure advances made through the discount window on December 31, 2017. There were no discount window advances outstanding at December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nOther Short-term Borrowings: Securities sold under agreements to repurchase were $27.7 million and $27.6 million, for December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The average balance outstanding of securities sold under agreements to repurchase during 2017 and 2016 was $29.0 million and $27.2 million, respectively, and the maximum outstanding at any month-end was $32.6 million and $30.5 million, respectively, during the same time periods. The securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the FHLB under the Company's control.\nThe Company is subject to provisions under Alaska state law which generally limits the amount of outstanding debt to 15% of total assets or $225.8 million and $227.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLong-term Borrowings: The Company had no long-term borrowings outstanding other than the FHLB advance noted above as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table references contractual obligations of the Company for the periods indicated:\n\n(1) Includes principal payments related to employee benefit plans. If a benefit payment schedule is established, payments are recorded in the corresponding dates listed in the table above. Unscheduled payments for all remaining benefits are recorded \"Over 5 Years\". Additional information about employee benefit plans is provided in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.\nThe table above does not include interest payments.\nShort and long-term borrowings included in the table above are described in the \"Borrowings\" section above. Junior subordinated debentures include $8.2 million that was originated on May 8, 2003, was redeemed on August 15, 2017, and bore interest at a rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 3.15%, adjusted quarterly, and $10.3 million that was originated on December 16, 2005, matures on March 15, 2036, and bears interest at a rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 1.37%, adjusted quarterly. The Company entered into an interest rate swap in the third quarter of 2017 to hedge the variability in cash flows arising out of its junior subordinated debentures, by swapping the cash flows with an interest rate swap which receives floating and pays fixed. The Company has designated this interest rate swap as a hedging instrument. The interest rate swap effectively fixes the Company's interest payments on the $10 million of junior subordinated debentures held under NST2 at 3.72% through its maturity date. Operating lease obligations are more fully described in Note 17 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Other long-term liabilities consist of amounts that the Company owes for its investments in Delaware limited partnerships that develop low-income housing projects throughout the United States. The Company purchased a $10.7 million interest in R4 Frontier Housing Partners L.P., Coronado Park Senior Village L.P. (\"R4-Coronado\") in March 2013. The investment in R4-Coronado is expected to be fully funded in 2029. The Company also purchased an $8.5 million interest in R4 Frontier Housing Partners L.P., Mountain View Village V L.P. (\"R4-MVV\") in May 2014. The investment in R4-MVV was 97% funded by the end of 2017 and is expected to be fully funded in 2030. The Company also purchased a $6.8 million interest in R4 Frontier Housing Partners L.P., PJ33 L.P. (\"R4-PJ33\") in June 2016. The investment in R4-PJ33 is expected to be 95% funded by the end of 2018 and fully funded in 2032.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. Among the off-balance sheet items entered into in the ordinary course of business are commitments to extend credit, commitments to originate loans held for sale and the issuance of letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the balance sheet. Certain commitments are collateralized. We apply the same credit standards to these commitments as in all of our lending activities and include these commitments in our lending risk evaluations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to extend credit of $283.9 million which were not reflected on our balance sheet compared to $236.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers. These commitments have specified interest rates and generally have fixed expiration dates but may be terminated by the Company if certain conditions of the contract are violated. Collateral held relating to these commitments varies, but generally includes real estate, inventory, accounts receivable, and equipment. Our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, these total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to originate loans held for sale of $43.6 million, which were not reflected in the balance sheet compared to $62.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mortgage loans sold to investors may be sold with servicing rights released, for which the Company makes only standard legal representations and warranties as to meeting certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards. In the past two years, the Company has had to repurchase one loan due to deficiencies in underwriting or loan documentation and has not realized significant losses related to this repurchase. Management currently believes that any liabilities that may result from such recourse provisions are not significant.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had standby letters of credit of $7.6 million which were not reflected on our balance sheet compared to $9.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Credit risk arises in these transactions from the possibility that a customer may not be able to repay the Company upon default of performance. Collateral held for standby letters of credit is based on an individual evaluation of each customer's creditworthiness.\nOur total unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2017, which includes commitments to extend credit, commitments to originate loans held for sale and standby letters of credit, were $335.1 million, compared to $309.0 million as of December 31, 2016. We do not expect that all of these commitments are likely to be fully drawn upon at any one time. The Company has established reserves of $152,000 and $122,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for losses related to these commitments that are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nAdditional information regarding Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements is included in Notes 17 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is from dividends received from the Bank. Such dividends arise from the cash flow and earnings of the Bank. Banking regulations and regulatory authorities may limit the amount of, or require the Bank to obtain certain approvals before paying, dividends to the Company. Given that the Bank currently meets and the Bank anticipates that they will continue to meet, all applicable capital adequacy requirements for a well-capitalized\u201d institution by regulatory standards, the Company expects to continue to receive dividends from the Bank during 2018. A requirement to have a conservation buffer began being phased-in in 2016 and this requirement could adversely affect the Bank's ability to pay dividends.\nThe Bank manages its liquidity through its Asset and Liability Committee. Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits and advances from the FHLB. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, other borrowed funds, retained earnings, and equity are used to make loans, to acquire securities and other assets, and to fund deposit flows and continuing operations. The primary sources of demands on our liquidity are customer demands for withdrawal of deposits and borrowers' demands that we advance funds against unfunded lending commitments. Our total unfunded commitments to fund loans, loans held for sale, and letters of credit at December 31, 2017, were $335.1 million. We do not expect that all of these loans are likely to be fully drawn upon at any one time. Additionally, as noted above, our total deposits at December 31, 2017, were $1.3 billion.\nAs shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, net cash provided by operating activities was $19.3 million, $20.1 million, and $10.6 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively. The primary source of cash provided by operating activities for all periods presented was positive net income in each of these periods. The primary reason that net cash provided by operating\nactivities decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016 was that the Company had a net proceeds of $17.8 million in 2017 compared to $32.4 million in 2016 from sales of loans held for sale. Net cash of $30.4 million was provided by investing activities in 2017 as the Company's proceeds from security sales, maturities, and calls were greater than funds used to purchase additional investment securities in 2017. $47.5 million and $63.5 million of cash were used in investing activities in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as the Company invested available cash primarily in available for sale securities and portfolio loans. Financing activities used cash of $22.4 million in 2017, and provided cash of $19.3 million, and $42.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Financing activities used net cash in 2017 as compared to providing cash in 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in deposit balances in 2017 compared to 2016, as well as the use of cash to redeem $8.2 million in junior subordinated debt in 2017.\nThe sources by which we meet the liquidity needs of our customers are current assets and borrowings available through our correspondent banking relationships and our credit lines with the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. At December 31, 2017, our current assets were $466.6 million and our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were $593.4 million. Given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs, we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient in the foreseeable future.\nDuring 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per common share for the first and second quarters and $0.22 per common share for the third and fourth quarters. These dividends were made pursuant to our existing dividend policy and in consideration of, among other things, earnings, regulatory capital levels, liquidity, asset quality, and the overall payout ratio. We expect that the dividend rate will be reassessed on a quarterly basis by the Board of Directors in accordance with the dividend policy. The payment of cash dividends is subject to regulatory limitations as described under the Supervision and Regulation section of Part I of this report. There is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased.\nOn February 22, 2018, the Board of Directors approved payment of a $0.24 per share dividend on March 16, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 8, 2018. This dividend is consistent with the Company's dividends that were declared and paid in 2017.\nIn September 2002, our Board of Directors approved a plan whereby we would periodically repurchase for cash up to approximately 5% of our shares of common stock in the open market. We purchased an aggregate of 688,442 shares of our stock under this program through December 31, 2009 at a total cost of $14.2 million at an average price of $20.65, which left a balance of 227,242 shares available under the stock repurchase program. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares in 2010 through 2016. In 2017, we purchased an aggregate of 58,341 shares at an average price of $27.56, which leaves a balance of 168,901 shares available under the stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2017. We intend to continue to repurchase our stock from time-to-time depending upon market conditions, but we can make no assurances that we will continue this program or that we will repurchase all of the authorized shares. The table below shows this effect on diluted earnings per share.\n\nOn May 8, 2003, the Company's subsidiary, NCT1, issued trust preferred securities in the principal amount of $8 million. These securities carried an interest rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 3.15% per annum that was initially set at 4.45% adjusted quarterly. The securities had a maturity date of May 15, 2033, and were callable by the Company on or after May 15, 2008. These securities were treated as Tier 1 capital by the Company's regulators for capital adequacy calculations. The Company redeemed these trust preferred securities on August 15, 2017. The interest cost to the Company of the trust preferred securities was $219,000 in 2017.\nOn December 16, 2005, the Company's subsidiary, NST2, issued trust preferred securities in the principal amount of $10 million. These securities carry an interest rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 1.37% per annum that was initially set at 5.86% adjusted quarterly. The securities have a maturity date of March 15, 2036, and are callable by the Company on or after March 15, 2011. These securities are treated as Tier 1 capital by the Company's regulators for capital adequacy calculations. The interest cost to the Company of these securities was $268,000 in 2017. At December 31, 2017, the securities had an interest rate of 2.96%. The\nCompany entered into an interest rate swap in the third quarter of 2017 to hedge the variability in cash flows arising out of its junior subordinated debentures, by swapping the cash flows with an interest rate swap which receives floating and pays fixed. The Company has designated this interest rate swap as a hedging instrument. The interest rate swap effectively fixes the Company's interest payments on the $10 million of junior subordinated debentures held under NST2 at 3.72% through its maturity date.\nOur shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017, was $192.8 million, as compared to $186.7 million at December 31, 2016. The Company earned net income of $13.2 million during 2017 and issued 32,414 shares through the exercise of stock options. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 6.9 million shares of its common stock outstanding.\nWe are subject to minimum capital requirements. Federal banking agencies have adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies. The requirements address both risk-based capital and leverage capital. We believe as of December 31, 2017, that the Company and the Bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements for a well-capitalized\u201d institution by regulatory standards.\nThe table below illustrates the capital requirements in effect in 2017 for the Company and the Bank and the actual capital ratios for each entity that exceed these requirements. Management intends to maintain capital ratios for the Bank in 2018, exceeding the FDIC's new requirements for the well-capitalized\u201d classification. The capital ratios for the Company exceed those for the Bank primarily because the $8 million trust preferred securities offering that the Company completed in the second quarter of 2003 and redeemed in the third quarter of 2017 and another offering of $10 million completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 are included in the Company's capital for regulatory purposes, although they are accounted for as a long-term debt in our financial statements. The trust preferred securities are not accounted for on the Bank's financial statements nor are they included in its capital. As a result, the Company has $10 million and $18 million more in regulatory capital than the Bank at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which explains most of the difference in the capital ratios for the two entities.\n\nSee Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the capital ratios. The requirements for \"well-capitalized\" come from the Prompt Correction Action rules. See Item 1 Supervision and Regulation. These rules apply to the Bank but not to the Company. Under the rules of the Federal Reserve Bank, a bank holding company such as the Company is generally defined to be \"well capitalized\" if its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 8.0% or more and its total risk-based capital ratio is 10.0% or more.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices: The primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates, which could affect the degree and timing of the repricing of our assets and liabilities. In addition, inflation has an impact on our customers' ability to repay their loans.", "item_7_tables": "Table 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
