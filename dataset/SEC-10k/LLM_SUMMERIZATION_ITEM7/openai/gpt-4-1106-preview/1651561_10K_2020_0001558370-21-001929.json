Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion focuses on 2020 and 2019 financial condition and results of operations and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Similar discussion of our 2018 financial condition and results and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOverview\nWe are innovating and redefining the medication safety market and, creating solutions designed to empower pharmacists, providers, and patients to optimize medication regimens. Our advanced technology, MedWise\u2122, predicts and identifies the cause of medication-related problems, including adverse drug events, so healthcare professionals can minimize harm and reduce medication-related risks. Our software and services help improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations and lower healthcare costs. We also believe we have the most extensive clinical tele-pharmacy network in the United States. Our solutions are trusted by health plans and pharmacies nationwide to assist them in meeting value-based payment requirements. Our vision and mission are supported by our industry-recognized leadership team,\nour significant investments and collaborations to advance medication safety-related pharmacotherapy research and its application in clinical practice, and our culture.\nWe operate our business through two segments, CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare, which accounted for 69% and 31% of revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our CareVention HealthCare segment provides our clients, primarily PACE programs, with medication fulfillment services, cloud-based software, pharmacy benefit management solutions, and clinical pharmacist services at the point-of-care. Our MedWise HealthCare segment provides our clients with cloud-based pharmacy software and full-service clinical pharmacy programs.\nCareVention HealthCare\nCareVention HealthCare primarily services PACE, which is a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, sponsored program providing comprehensive medical and social services to adults age 55 and older who need a nursing facility level of care but can live safely in community settings. Our clients include ArchCare Senior Life, Trinity Health, Palm Beach PACE, and St. Paul's PACE. We go to market through a number of different brands, including CareKinesis, Capstone Risk Adjustment Services, PACElogic, TruChart, PeakTPA, PersonifilRx, and Pharmastar.\nOur largest CareVention HealthCare offering is our medication fulfillment services which are built around our novel and proprietary Medication Risk Mitigation Matrix, or MRM Matrix, designed to enable clinicians to increase patient safety, create individualized medication regimens, promote adherence, reduce total medication burden, and eliminate unnecessary prescriptions. Our medication fulfillment and reminder packaging services utilize the MRM Matrix technology to reduce medication-related risk for the high-cost, high-risk PACE population. The CareVention HealthCare suite of offerings also includes risk adjustment services, pharmacy benefit management solutions, cloud-based electronic health records solutions and third-party administration services, which are all specifically tailored to the PACE market.\nThe CareVention HealthCare segment revenue model is primarily based on payments on a per-member per-month, or PMPM, basis, payments on a subscription basis, payments on a transaction basis, and charges and dispensing fees for medication fulfillment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our CareVention HealthCare segment served more than 130 healthcare organizations.\nMedWise HealthCare\nOur MedWise HealthCare segment is primarily comprised of service offerings from our acquisitions of Sinfon\u00edaRx in September 2017 and PrescribeWellness in March 2019. As a result of these acquisitions, we are a leading provider of Medication Therapy Management, or MTM, software and services for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plans and also a leading provider of cloud-based patient engagement software and services to more than 14,000 pharmacies nationwide.\nMore than 280 health plans, including several Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations, Express Scripts, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, and WellCare, utilize our MedWise HealthCare solutions to execute a range of clinical programs. These programs support MTM, Enhanced MTM (a five-year Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Innovation Part D pilot that began January 1, 2017), Medicare Part D Star Ratings, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures, and post-hospital discharge care transitions through a combination of our nearly 30,000 PrescribeWellness network pharmacists and/or our clinical tele-pharmacy call centers across the country employing nearly 400 pharmacists. Within our MedWise HealthCare segment, we offer our cloud-based software and clinical pharmacist services through a number of different brands, including MedWise, Sinfon\u00edaRx, RxCompanion, PrescribeWellness, and DoseMeRx. The MedWise HealthCare segment revenue model is primarily based on payments on a PMPM basis, payments on a subscription basis, and payments on a fee-for-service basis for each clinical intervention.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our MedWise HealthCare segment served more than 280 health plans and approximately 14,000 retail pharmacies.\nOur total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $297.2 million and $284.7 million, respectively. We incurred a net loss of $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and net loss of $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.8 million compared to $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA\" for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, why we present Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net losses to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe face a variety of challenges and risks, which we will need to address and manage as we pursue our growth strategy. In particular, we will need to continue to innovate in the face of a rapidly changing healthcare landscape if we are to remain competitive. We will also need to effectively manage our growth, especially related to our expansion beyond the PACE and post-acute markets to other at-risk providers and payers. Our senior management continuously focuses on these and other challenges, and we believe that our culture of innovation and our history of growth and expansion will contribute to the success of our business. We cannot, however, assure you that we will be successful in addressing and managing the many challenges and risks that we face.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate and manage our business. These metrics are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 297,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 284,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 12,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80,966)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32,436)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48,530)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (150)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,146)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (43)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe monitor the key metrics set forth in the preceding table to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and gauge our cash generation. We discuss Adjusted EBITDA in more detail in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA.\" We also monitor revenue retention rate described as follows.\nNet Revenue Retention\nWe believe that our ability to retain revenue associated with new or existing client relationships is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value we provide to our clients. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as net revenue retention. We calculate our net revenue retention by comparing revenue by client and segment at the end of the most recent calendar year divided by revenue at the end of the prior calendar year from only clients that were contracted with us at the end of the prior calendar year. We believe net revenue retention is a more meaningful metric versus prior disclosures, such as client retention, as this figure captures our cross-sell success, client expansion, changes in pricing, and client churn or downgrades.\nExcluding the impact of the Personica acquisition, we generated net revenue retention of 111% at our PACE clients during 2020, driven by census growth at existing clients and cross-sell revenue. Our MedWise HealthCare segment generated net revenue retention of 73% in 2020 compared to 119% in 2019. The decline in the 2020 MedWise HealthCare net revenue retention was primarily due to consolidation in the health plan industry, which redirected MTM work previously delivered by us, new restrictions related to comprehensive medications reviews completed with caregivers and prescribers, which temporarily slowed patient engagement during the year, and fewer adherence programs resulting from higher adherence rates in 2020 due to health plan actions taken to respond to COVID-19 earlier this year.\nFactors Affecting our Future Performance\nWe believe that our future success will be dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with existing clients, expand our client base, continue to enter new markets and expand our offerings to meet evolving market needs. While these areas present significant opportunities, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results. See the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may impact our future success.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, announced a global health emergency caused by a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, or the COVID-19 outbreak, and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The full impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we are uncertain as to the full magnitude of the impact that the pandemic will have on our financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the global situation and the ramification on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global responses to curb its spread, we are not able to estimate the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for 2021. However, we are dependent on our workforce to sell and deliver our products and services. Social distancing and shelter-in-place directives could impact our ability to deploy our workforce effectively. These same developments may affect the operations of our suppliers and customers, as their own workforces and operations are disrupted by the spread of this virus.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced challenges with revenue growth. The pandemic has delayed the closing of contracts across both our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare segments and, in some cases, shifted project priorities and timelines, which we believe resulted in fewer new business wins relative to our original expectations. Overall census growth for PACE has remained below historical levels, which has affected the Company's CareVention HealthCare segment growth as our segment revenue growth is largely driven by organic census increases at our existing PACE organizations. We are closely monitoring the ongoing pandemic in terms of infection and death rates, the latter of which spiked in the month of May and again increased at the end of 2020, negatively impacting our overall census figures. Our MedWise HealthCare segment also has experienced delays in the timing of implementation and closing of new business, as well as a negative impact from COVID-19 on medication adherence initiatives, which are seasonally weighted toward the second half of the calendar year. The continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change depending on factors such as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. We did not see material delays in scheduled PACE center openings during 2020. Accordingly, we believe that our current backlog of new extension centers and new PACE organizations under contract to open over the next 12 months could represent in excess of $75 million in annual revenue when the centers are operating at full capacity, which typically takes two to three years once a PACE center has opened its doors. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our results and financial position will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and difficult to predict, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken to contain it or address its impact, and the availability and widespread distribution and use of effective vaccines.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisitions\nOn October 5, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Personica, a provider of pharmacy services, including 340B and Medicare Part D administration solutions for PACE. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $10.0 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments; (ii) the issuance of 555,555 shares of our common stock; and (iii) promissory notes, or the Notes, for the payment of (a) $7.5 million in cash, which was paid in January 2021, (b) $5.5 million in cash within two business days following April 1, 2021, and (c) $4 million in cash within two business days following October 5, 2021. We may set-off amounts due under the Notes to the extent we are entitled to indemnification under the related purchase agreement or in respect of adjustments to the purchase price.\nWe account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, based on estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. The results of operations from the acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nFinancing\nOn December 18, 2020, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Western Alliance Bank, or the 2020 Credit Facility, which provides for a $120.0 million secured revolving credit facility, with a $1.0 million sublimit for cash management services and letters of credit and foreign exchange transactions. The 2020 Credit Facility replaced the previous line of credit agreement with Western Alliance Bank, or the 2015 Line of Credit, which matured on December 6, 2020. The 2020 Credit Facility bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% and matures on May 16, 2025. The 2020 Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens, merge or consolidate, make dispositions, pay dividends or make distributions, make investments, pay any subordinated indebtedness, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or make capital expenditures. The 2020 Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants, including (i) maintaining unrestricted cash balances with Western Alliance Bank, plus amounts available for draw under the credit facility of at least $10.0 million at all times, and (ii) maintaining a leverage ratio of less than 3.00:1.00, on a trailing twelve-month basis, measured quarterly. The obligations under the 2020 Credit Facility are secured by all of our Company's assets, as set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement.\nCorporate Reorganization\nEffective January 1, 2020, in order to facilitate the administration, management, and development of our business and minimize the burden on our tax and regulatory reporting obligations, we implemented a reorganization pursuant to which all of our domestic subsidiaries, other than CK Solutions, LLC, merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary CareKinesis, Inc., which had previously changed its legal name on December 20, 2019 to TRHC OpCo, Inc. In the second quarter of 2020, TRHC OpCo, Inc. further changed its name to Tabula Rasa HealthCare Group, Inc., or the TRHC Group. Following such reorganization, our only directly owned subsidiary is TRHC Group, which is the parent of CK Solutions, LLC, three foreign subsidiaries related to the acquisition of DoseMe, and Personica. In conjunction with our reorganization, we now operate our business through two segments, CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is derived from our product sales and service activities under our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare segments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, product sales represented 57% and 48% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, service revenue represented 43% and 52% of our total revenue, respectively.\nCareVention HealthCare\nPACE Product Revenue\nWe provide medication fulfillment pharmacy services to PACE organizations, and, while the majority of medications are routinely filled in order to treat chronic conditions, the mix and quantity of medications can vary. Revenue from medication fulfillment services is generally billed monthly or weekly, depending on whether the PACE organization is contracted with a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), and recognized when medications are delivered and control has passed to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nPACE Solutions\nWe provide services to PACE organizations, and these services primarily include medication safety services and health plan management services, which consist of risk adjustment services, PBM solutions, electronic health records solutions, and third party administration services. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of a fixed monthly fee assessed based on number of members served, or per member per month, a fee for each claim adjudicated, and subscription fees. These fees are recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide PACE services, which occurs when our clients have access to the PACE services. We generally bill for PACE services on a monthly basis as the services are provided.\nMedWise HealthCare\nProduct Revenue\nWe provide COVID-19 test kits to pharmacies and other clients. Revenue from the sale of these products is generally billed when test kits are shipped and is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligations to deliver the test kits and provide the test results. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nMedication Safety Services\nWe provide medication safety services, which include identification of high-risk individuals, medication regimen reviews including patient and prescriber counseling, and targeted interventions to increase adherence and close gaps in care. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of per member per month fees and fees for each medication review and assessment completed. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide medication safety services, which occurs when our clients have access to the medication safety services, and when medication reviews and assessments are completed. We generally bill for the medication safety services on a monthly basis.\nSoftware Subscription and Services\nWe provide software as a service, or SaaS, solutions, which allow for the identification of individuals with high medication-related risk, for patient communication and engagement, for documentation of clinical interventions, for optimizing medication therapy, for targeting adherence improvement, and for precision dosing. Revenues related to these software services primarily consist of monthly subscription fees and are recognized monthly as we meet our performance obligation to provide access to the software. Revenue for implementation and set up services is generally recognized over the contract term as the software services are provided. We generally bill for the software services on a monthly basis.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nProduct Cost\nCost of product revenue includes all costs directly related to the fulfillment and distribution of medications under our CareVention HealthCare offerings. Costs consist primarily of the purchase price of the medications we dispense. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, medication costs represented 79% of our total product costs. In addition to costs incurred to purchase the medications we dispense, other costs include shipping; packaging; expenses associated with operating our medication fulfillment centers, including salaries and related costs, such as stock-based compensation for personnel; technology expenses; direct overhead expenses; and allocated indirect overhead costs. We allocate indirect overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nService Cost\nCost of service revenue includes all costs directly related to servicing our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare service contracts, which primarily consist of labor costs, including stock-based compensation; outside contractors; expenses related to supporting our software platforms; direct overhead expenses; and allocated indirect overhead costs. We allocate indirect overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our research and development functions. This personnel includes software engineers and employees engaged in scientific research, healthcare analytics, and the design and development of new scientific algorithms and the enhancement of our software and technology platforms; fees paid to third-party consultants; costs related to quality assurance and testing; and other allocated facility-related overhead and expenses.\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with obtaining or developing the proprietary software platforms that support our product and service contracts, including third-party contractors and payroll costs for employees directly involved with the software development. Capitalized software development costs are amortized beginning when the software project is substantially complete and the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and applications to increase the functionality and enhance the ease of use of our existing suite of software solutions.\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our research and development efforts to further strengthen and enhance our software solutions and service offerings, but will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term as we expect our revenue to increase at a greater rate than such expenses.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries, commissions, bonuses, and stock-based compensation and employee benefits for sales, marketing, and account management personnel, as well as travel costs related to sales, marketing, and account management activities. Marketing costs also include costs for communication and branding materials, conferences, trade shows, public relations, and allocated overhead.\nWe expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we strategically invest to grow our sales, account management, and marketing infrastructure as we introduce new products and enter new markets, but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, for employees who are responsible for information systems, administration, human resources, finance, strategy, legal and executive management as well as other corporate expenses associated with these functional areas. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand our infrastructure and continue to comply with the requirements applicable to public companies, but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term.\nChange in Fair Value of Acquisition-related Contingent Consideration\nWe classify our acquisition-related contingent consideration as a liability. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date. Any change in the fair value of such acquisition-related contingent consideration is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a change in fair value of the liability. We adjust the carrying value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration until the contingency is finally determined or final payment is made.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Charge\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. When an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, we compare forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted\nfuture cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investment in equipment, our capitalized software, and our acquisition-related intangibles.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is primarily attributable to interest expense associated with our 2026 Convertible Notes, our 2015 Line of Credit and 2020 Credit Facility, the promissory notes related to the Personica acquisition purchase consideration, and our finance lease obligations. It also includes the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our various debt arrangements.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and

31, 2020. New business acquired from the Personica acquisition contributed approximately $1.8 million to the increase. New CareVention HealthCare clients that started services after January 2019 contributed $8.4 million to the increase. Increased medication fulfillment volume from growth in the number of patients served by our existing clients, medication mix of prescriptions filled, and payer mix contributed $11.1 million to the increase. The increase in product revenue was also due to $1.2 million of revenue generated from the sale of COVID-19 test kits in 2020 through our CareVention HealthCare segment and PrescribeWellness pharmacy network.\nService Revenue\nService revenue decreased $10.0 million, or 7%, from $147.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $137.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nService revenues generated by our MedWise HealthCare segment decreased by $11.6 million, or 11%, to $90.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $101.7 million for the same period in 2019. We experienced a $14.6 million decrease in medication safety services driven by the completion of fewer comprehensive medication reviews during the year ended December 31, 2020. The reduction was primarily due to consolidation in the health plan industry, which reduced MTM volumes required by a couple larger clients, as well as new restrictions related to comprehensive medications reviews completed with caregivers and prescribers, which temporarily slowed patient engagement during the year. Also, we experienced fewer adherence programs resulting from higher adherence rates in 2020 due to health plan actions taken to respond to COVID-19 earlier this year. In addition, data analytics fees earned were down $5.5 million due to a new contract with our data aggregation partner, which began in the first quarter of 2020. These decreases were offset by an increase in software subscription and software related services revenue of $8.4 million, which was primarily attributable to the PrescribeWellness acquisition completed on March 5, 2019.\nCareVention HealthCare service revenue increased by $1.7 million, or 4%, to $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. Lower fees earned from our data analytics contract negatively impacted revenue by $4.2 million. The acquisition of Personica in October 2020 contributed $1.7 million to the increase. Excluding these impacts, CareVention HealthCare service revenues increased $4.2 million. The increase was a result of new clients and growth with existing clients added since January 2019.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue increased $14.8 million, or 14%, from $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $117.2 million for the comparable period in 2020. New business acquired from the Personica acquisition contributed approximately $1.7 million to the increase. New CareVention HealthCare clients that started services after January 2019 contributed $4.8 million to the increase. In addition, increased medication volume from growth in the number of patients served by our existing customers, manufacturer price increases, and medication mix of prescriptions filled for our clients contributed approximately $5.0 million to the change. This was partially offset by a decrease in the acquisition cost of medications from our new purchasing agreement with Thrifty Drug Stores of $1.1 million. The increase in cost of product revenue was also due to a $2.0 million increase in distribution charges related to higher shipping volume for the medications we fulfilled and $1.0 million of COVID-19 test kits sold to clients during the year ended December 31, 2020. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to increases in headcount to support our overall growth.\nCost of Service Revenue\nCost of service revenue increased $8.6 million, or 11%, from $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCost of service revenue related to our CareVention HealthCare segment increased $6.0 million, or 23%, to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. Of the total increase, $1.0 million related to the acquisition of Personica in October 2020. The remaining increase was attributable to investments in infrastructure in order to better scale the delivery of third party administrative services into markets outside of PACE.\nCost of service revenue related to our MedWise HealthCare segment increased $2.6 million, or 5%, to $56.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The acquisition of PrescribeWellness contributed $2.4 million to the total increase and primarily consisted of employee compensation and technology costs. Our MedWise HealthCare segment also experienced a $1.8 million increase in fees related to the higher utilization of community pharmacies to deliver clinical intervention services under our EMTM program, which in some cases drives increased levels of engagement in our high-risk target population. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in the use of contracted resources to deliver on medication safety services, primarily MTM, as well as reduced printing and postage expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased $3.6 million, or 16%, from $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was mostly due to a reduction of $1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, primarily related to performance-based equity awards and common stock awarded during 2019. The remaining decrease is primarily attributable to lower payroll costs as a result of the realignment of resources associated with our Company's reorganization in January 2020 to better support our customers and business objectives.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $3.7 million, or 15%, from $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease includes $5.0 million of employee compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel previously included in sales and marketing, who are now dedicated to corporate strategy and executive leadership initiatives and are recorded in general and administrative expenses. The change in allocation resulted from our Company's reorganization in January 2020 to better align resources in order to support the achievement of our business objectives. This decrease was offset by an increase of $1.3 million as a result of the acquisition of PrescribeWellness toward the end of the first quarter of 2019, which primarily related to employee compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $14.5 million, or 28%, from $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $65.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquisitions of Personica and PrescribeWellness contributed $429 thousand to the increase in expenses, which consisted primarily of employee compensation costs, including stock compensation, information technology expenses, business insurance costs, and rent and utilities expenses. Excluding costs related to the acquisitions, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $14.1 million.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation costs of $15.7 million, which included an $8.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to equity awards granted during 2020. The increase in employee compensation costs was also due to the realignment of resources dedicated to service administrative functions to support the achievement of our business objectives as a result of our Company's reorganization in January 2020. The realignment included moving resources accounting for $5.0 million to corporate strategy and executive leadership roles from sales and marketing, and $2.5 million from the transition of key employees, previously included in cost of revenues, to executive roles. Additional headcount to support the overall growth of our operations contributed $1.3 million to the increase in compensation costs, which was offset by a $1.8 million reduction in bonus expense. The remaining increases were due to higher technology-related expenses and business insurance costs. These increases in general and administrative expenses were offset by a decrease in acquisition-related costs of $2.6 million due to the larger acquisition of PrescribeWellness in the first quarter of 2019.\nAcquisition-related Contingent Consideration Expense\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a $2.6 million and $3.8 million charge, respectively, related to the fair value adjustments of our acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we elected to accelerate the payment of the acquisition-related contingent consideration associated with our Cognify acquisition for an aggregate payment of $13.4 million, which was partially satisfied by a cash payment of $6.4 million and partially satisfied by the issuance of 135,434 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $6.9 million. In the first quarter of 2021, we made a final cash payment of $166 thousand in full satisfaction of the remaining acquisition-related contingent consideration liability. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $2.6 million charge to increase the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration primarily due to the accelerated payment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $3.0 million charge to increase the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration primarily due to an amendment of certain definitions used in the calculation of the contingent consideration set forth in the stock purchase agreement, and the decreased discount period to the final measurement date. The Cognify contingent\nconsideration was based on a multiple of the excess of Cognify's 2021 revenues and EBITDA over its 2018 revenues and EBITDA, as defined in the stock purchase agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we also recognized an aggregate $817 thousand charge related to fair value adjustments for the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisition-related contingent considerations, which were all subsequently paid in full during 2019.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Charge\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $5.0 million intangible asset impairment charge related to certain intangible assets obtained from the Medliance acquisition in 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we became aware of changes in circumstances impacting the future performance of our pharmacy cost management services and evaluated the recoverability of the related intangible assets by comparing their carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets to determine if the carrying value is not recoverable. The recoverability test indicated that certain customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets were impaired. As a result, we used an income approach to measure the fair value of the intangible assets and recognized non-cash impairment charges of $3.8 million and $1.2 million to the customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $10.8 million, or 31%, from $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to a $5.3 million increase in the amortization of capitalized software related to new software functionality placed into service since 2019 to support our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare segments. Amortization expense also increased by $2.2 million as a result of changes in the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets, $2.1 million as a result of intangible assets from PrescribeWellness in March 2019, and $625 thousand as a result of intangible assets from the Personica acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2020. Depreciation expense increased by $603 thousand primarily related to the completion of expanded office space at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters, the purchase of additional equipment for our pharmacy in Moorestown, New Jersey, and the completion of our research facility in Lake Nona, Florida during the third quarter of 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $4.7 million from $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in interest expense related to the 2026 Convertible Notes, which were issued in February 2019 and $440 thousand of interest expense on acquisition-related notes payable related to the Personica acquisition on October 4, 2020. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $220 thousand on the 2015 Line of Credit and 2020 Credit Facility.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $5.2 million and $16.2 million, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 6.0% and 33.3%, respectively. The benefit primarily consists of the benefit generated by the Company's losses, the benefit from windfall tax benefits generated from the vesting of restricted stock, disqualifying dispositions, and exercising of nonqualified stock options during the period, offset by other tax expense due to the increase in the Company's valuation allowance.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information about our financial results, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net loss plus certain other expenses, which include interest expense, benefit for income tax, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense, intangible asset impairment charge, severance expense incurred in 2020 in connection with the Company's reorganization, severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018, acquisition-related expense, and stock-based compensation related expense. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is one of the measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance, and we consider it an important supplemental measure of performance. We believe this metric is commonly used by the financial community, and we present it to enhance investors' understanding of our operating performance and cash flows. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations.\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>to prepare and approve our annual budget; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>to develop short- and long-term operational plans. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. As a non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In particular:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash interest income or expense; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect severance-related payments related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect severance-related payments incurred in 2020 in connection with the Company's reorganization; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP financial results and not in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. You should be\naware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss for the periods presented:\nTable 204: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (80,966)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (32,436)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (47,269)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 906\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,168)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,199)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,376)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,802\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,468\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible asset impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 390\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,901\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation related expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,499\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 21,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 37,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,321\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Diluted Net (Loss) Income Per Share, or Adjusted Diluted EPS\nAdjusted Diluted EPS excludes the impact of certain items and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe the exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying operations, results, and trends; allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry; and enables more consistency with our expected capital structure on a going forward basis. Our management uses this measure along with corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as net loss before fair value adjustments for acquisition-related contingent consideration, intangible asset impairment charge, amortization of acquired intangibles, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, severance expense incurred in 2020 in connection with the Company's reorganization, severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018, acquisition-related expense, stock-based compensation related expense, and the tax impact of those items using a normalized tax rate on pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for those items expressed on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue.\nAdjusted Diluted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. In the future, we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following table reconciles net loss per share on a diluted basis, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted Diluted EPS:\nTable 205: <table><tr><td>\n</td>

These noncash items primarily included $45.0 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $32.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $13.6 million of amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts primarily related to the 2026 Convertible Notes, changes in net deferred taxes of $5.3 million, a $5.0 million intangible asset impairment charge, and a $2.6 million change in fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration. The change in operating assets and liabilities, net of the effect from acquisitions, was primarily due to an increase in client claims receivables and an increase in accounts receivable, which was attributable to growth in our CareVention HealthCare segment as a result of new clients and growth in existing clients, as well as timing of client payments. The change in operating assets and liabilities was also due to a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to lower accrued employee compensation costs. The change in operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to payments received related to prior year contract asset balances and non-trade receivable, and an increase in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of vendor payments.\nNet cash used by operating activities was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $32.4 million, $24.5 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisitions, changes in net deferred taxes of $16.4 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $8.8 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $76.3 million. The noncash items primarily included $34.3 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $27.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, $10.9 million of amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts primarily related to the 2026 Convertible Notes, and $3.8 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, Cognify, and DoseMe. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in prepaid and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets and an increase in prepaid information technology expenses. The change in operating assets and liabilities was also due to a decrease in accounts payable as a result of shorter payment terms with our new medication vendor, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of higher accrued employee compensation, contract liabilities related to our performance obligations for our services, and interest expense.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $47.3 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $10.0 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $73.1 million. The noncash items primarily included $49.5 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and Cognify, $16.8 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, and $10.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit of $3.6 million. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to revenues generated as a result of the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify acquisitions, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets related to estimated drug utilization fees in pharmacy cost management services and a decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued contract labor costs to support our MedWise HealthCare services, accrued employee related expenses, and client fund obligations acquired from the Peak PACE and Mediture acquisitions in 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and reflected $6.8 million paid in connection with the acquisition of Personica, net of cash acquired. In addition, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $18.8 million in software development costs for our CareVention Healthcare and MedWise HealthCare technologies. Net cash used in investing activities also consisted of $3.1 million in purchases of property, equipment, and leasehold improvements primarily related to equipment to support the pharmacy at our Moorestown, New Jersey location, improvements for our expanded office space at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters, and improvements for our new call center space in Tucson, Arizona to support our medication safety services.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $180.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and reflected $158.8 million paid in connection with the acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness, net of cash acquired. In addition, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $14.5 million in software development costs for our CareVention and MedWise HealthCare technologies, $7.5 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to equipment and improvements for our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters and our research facility in Lake Nona, Florida, and $1.2 million in connection with the purchase of developed technology to support our MedWise HealthCare services. Net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds received from the repayment of the $1.0 million note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd in 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and reflected $32.2 million, net of cash acquired, paid in connection with the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify. Net cash used in investing activities included $5.6 million of software development costs for our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare technologies. Net cash used in investing activities also included $5.0 million in purchases of property and equipment and in leasehold improvements, primarily related to new pharmacy dispensing equipment, equipment and improvements for our new office space in Tucson, Arizona for Sinfon\u00edaRx, and improvements for our spaces in Austin, Texas and Gainesville, Florida dedicated to our MedWise HealthCare service call centers. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included $1.0 million related to the note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and primarily reflected $10.0 million of borrowings on our 2020 Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of Personica, and $3.9 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was partially offset by $3.8 million of payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the Cognify acquisition, $3.0 million in payments for payroll taxes remitted to taxing authorities on behalf of employees for shares withheld from the net exercise of stock options during 2020, and $1.3 million in payments for debt financing costs.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily reflected gross proceeds of $325.0 million from the issuance of the 2026 Convertible Notes, $65.9 million from the proceeds of the warrant transactions and $3.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially offset by a payment of $101.7 million for the convertible hedge options entered into in connection with the offering of the 2026 Convertible Notes, a payment of $45.0 million to repay the amounts outstanding on the 2015 Line of Credit, $29.1 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisitions, $9.6 million in payments for debt financing costs, and $968 thousand in payments of long-term debt.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted of $45.0 million of borrowings on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line to fund the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify, $3.5 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, and $156 thousand received as a result of a disgorgement related to short swing profits. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was partially offset by $2.9 million in payments for the repurchase of common stock, a $1.6 million payment of contingent purchase price consideration related to our Medliance acquisition, $1.1 million in payments of long-term debt, and $539 thousand in payments for debt financing and costs associated with our common stock offering completed in December 2017.\nFunding Requirements\nOn December 18, 2020, we entered into the 2020 Credit Facility, which provides for a $120 million secured revolving credit facility, and matures on May 16, 2025. We have $109.9 million available for borrowings under our 2020 Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all related financial and operating covenants thereunder as of December 31, 2020. See Note 13 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to the 2020 Credit Facility.\nWe believe that our unrestricted cash of $23.4 million as of December 31, 2020, borrowing capacity under our 2020 Credit Facility, and cash flows from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least March 31, 2022. Our ability to maintain successful operations will depend on, among other things, new business, the retention of clients and the effectiveness of sales and marketing initiatives.\nWe may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financings. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion, or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>than 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>than 5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior subordinated notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 325,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 325,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration payments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related notes payable (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,535\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letter of credit (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 372,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 22,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 335,635\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>Contingent consideration represents the future cash payments as of December 31, 2020 related to our acquisition of Cognify in 2018.

The contract commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of 98% of our total prescription product requirements from Thrifty Drug Stores through September 2023.\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table and described above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe base this management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to: (i) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, (ii) the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities, (iii) the useful lives of long-lived assets (including definite-lived intangible assets), (iv) the evaluation of revenue recognition criteria, (v) the realizability of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets, (vi) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases, and (vii) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of convertible debt instruments and related equity-\nclassified conversion options. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. You should consider your evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations with these policies, judgments, and estimates in mind.\nWhile we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe provide technology-enabled solutions tailored toward the specific needs of healthcare organizations, including payers, providers, and pharmacies. These solutions can be integrated or provided on a standalone basis. Contracts generally have a term of one to five years and in some cases automatically renew at the end of the initial term. In most cases, clients may terminate their contracts with a notice period ranging from 0 to 180 days without cause, thereby limiting the term in which we have enforceable rights and obligations. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected in exchange for the goods or services.\nWe use the practical expedient not to account for significant financing components because the period between recognition and collection does not exceed one year for most of our contracts. We do not disclose the amount of variable consideration that we expect to recognize in future periods as the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of single performance obligation, and the terms of that variable consideration relate specifically to our efforts to transfer the distinct service, or to a specific outcome from transferring the distinct service. Our customers' contracts primarily include monthly fees associated with unspecified membership, claims, or medication safety reviews that fluctuate throughout the contract.\nCareVention HealthCare\nPACE Product Revenue\nWe provide medication fulfillment pharmacy services to PACE organizations, and, while the majority of medications are routinely filled in order to treat chronic conditions, the mix and quantity of medications can vary. Revenue from medication fulfillment services is generally billed monthly or weekly, depending on whether the PACE organization is contracted with a PBM, and recognized when medications are delivered and control has passed to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nPACE Solutions\nWe provide services to PACE organizations, and these services primarily include medication safety services and health plan management services, which consist of risk adjustment services, PBM solutions, electronic health records solutions, and third party administration services. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of a fixed monthly fee assessed based on number of members served, or per member per month, a fee for each claim adjudicated, and subscription fees. These fees are recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide PACE services, which occurs when our clients have access to the PACE services. We generally bill for PACE services on a monthly basis as the services are provided.\nMedWise HealthCare\nProduct Revenue\nWe provide COVID-19 test kits to pharmacies and other clients. Revenue from the sale of these products is generally billed when test kits are shipped and is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligations to deliver the test kits and provide the test results. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nMedication Safety Services\nWe provide medication safety services, which include identification of high-risk individuals, medication regimen reviews including patient and prescriber counseling, and targeted interventions to increase adherence and close gaps in care. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of per member per month fees and fees for each medication review and assessment completed. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide medication safety services, which occurs when our clients have access to the medication safety services, and when medication reviews and assessments are completed. We generally bill for the medication safety services on a monthly basis.\nSoftware Subscription and Services\nWe provide software as a service, or SaaS, solutions, which allow for the identification of individuals with high medication-related risk, for patient communication and engagement, for documentation of clinical interventions, for optimizing medication therapy, for targeting adherence improvement, and for precision dosing. Revenues related to these software services primarily consist of monthly subscription fees and are recognized monthly as we meet our performance obligation to provide access to the software. Revenue for implementation and set up services is generally recognized over the contract term as the software services are provided. We generally bill for the software services on a monthly basis.\nBusiness Combinations and Contingent Consideration\nAcquired businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the net assets acquired at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to contingent consideration are recorded to the balance sheet at the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values. The purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nWe account for contingent consideration in accordance with applicable guidance provided within the business combination accounting rules. As part of our consideration for the SRx, Peak PACE, Cognify and DoseMe acquisitions, we were contractually obligated to pay certain consideration resulting from the outcome of future events. Therefore, we are required to update our underlying assumptions each reporting period, based on new developments, and record such contingent consideration liabilities at fair value until the contingency is resolved. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recognized each reporting period and included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nExamples of critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets and contingent consideration include:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>future expected cash flows from sales and acquired developed technologies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the acquired company's trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company's portfolio; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the probability of meeting the future events; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill consists of the excess purchase price over fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually. GAAP provides an entity an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the quantitative assessment. If this is the case, the quantitative impairment test is required. Factors we generally consider important in our qualitative assessment that could trigger a step-two impairment test include significant underperformance relative to expected operating trends, significant changes in the way assets are used, underutilization of our tangible assets, discontinuance of certain products by us or by our clients, changes in the competitive environment and significant negative industry or economic trends. If it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is not required. If the quantitative impairment test is required, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flows analysis.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill and determined that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than the carrying amount. Accordingly, no impairment loss was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Other Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of property and equipment, software development costs and definite-lived intangible assets. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, we compare forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows.\nAlthough we believe the carrying values of our long-lived assets are currently realizable, future events could cause us to conclude otherwise.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of new accounting standards. As of January 1, 2020, we adopted the following new accounting standards: Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, and Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion focuses on 2020 and 2019 financial condition and results of operations and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Similar discussion of our 2018 financial condition and results and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOverview\nWe are innovating and redefining the medication safety market and, creating solutions designed to empower pharmacists, providers, and patients to optimize medication regimens. Our advanced technology, MedWise\u2122, predicts and identifies the cause of medication-related problems, including adverse drug events, so healthcare professionals can minimize harm and reduce medication-related risks. Our software and services help improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations and lower healthcare costs. We also believe we have the most extensive clinical tele-pharmacy network in the United States. Our solutions are trusted by health plans and pharmacies nationwide to assist them in meeting value-based payment requirements. Our vision and mission are supported by our industry-recognized leadership team,\nour significant investments and collaborations to advance medication safety-related pharmacotherapy research and its application in clinical practice, and our culture.\nWe operate our business through two segments, CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare, which accounted for 69% and 31% of revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our CareVention HealthCare segment provides our clients, primarily PACE programs, with medication fulfillment services, cloud-based software, pharmacy benefit management solutions, and clinical pharmacist services at the point-of-care. Our MedWise HealthCare segment provides our clients with cloud-based pharmacy software and full-service clinical pharmacy programs.\nCareVention HealthCare\nCareVention HealthCare primarily services PACE, which is a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, sponsored program providing comprehensive medical and social services to adults age 55 and older who need a nursing facility level of care but can live safely in community settings. Our clients include ArchCare Senior Life, Trinity Health, Palm Beach PACE, and St. Paul's PACE. We go to market through a number of different brands, including CareKinesis, Capstone Risk Adjustment Services, PACElogic, TruChart, PeakTPA, PersonifilRx, and Pharmastar.\nOur largest CareVention HealthCare offering is our medication fulfillment services which are built around our novel and proprietary Medication Risk Mitigation Matrix, or MRM Matrix, designed to enable clinicians to increase patient safety, create individualized medication regimens, promote adherence, reduce total medication burden, and eliminate unnecessary prescriptions. Our medication fulfillment and reminder packaging services utilize the MRM Matrix technology to reduce medication-related risk for the high-cost, high-risk PACE population. The CareVention HealthCare suite of offerings also includes risk adjustment services, pharmacy benefit management solutions, cloud-based electronic health records solutions and third-party administration services, which are all specifically tailored to the PACE market.\nThe CareVention HealthCare segment revenue model is primarily based on payments on a per-member per-month, or PMPM, basis, payments on a subscription basis, payments on a transaction basis, and charges and dispensing fees for medication fulfillment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our CareVention HealthCare segment served more than 130 healthcare organizations.\nMedWise HealthCare\nOur MedWise HealthCare segment is primarily comprised of service offerings from our acquisitions of Sinfon\u00edaRx in September 2017 and PrescribeWellness in March 2019. As a result of these acquisitions, we are a leading provider of Medication Therapy Management, or MTM, software and services for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plans and also a leading provider of cloud-based patient engagement software and services to more than 14,000 pharmacies nationwide.\nMore than 280 health plans, including several Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations, Express Scripts, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, and WellCare, utilize our MedWise HealthCare solutions to execute a range of clinical programs. These programs support MTM, Enhanced MTM (a five-year Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Innovation Part D pilot that began January 1, 2017), Medicare Part D Star Ratings, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures, and post-hospital discharge care transitions through a combination of our nearly 30,000 PrescribeWellness network pharmacists and/or our clinical tele-pharmacy call centers across the country employing nearly 400 pharmacists. Within our MedWise HealthCare segment, we offer our cloud-based software and clinical pharmacist services through a number of different brands, including MedWise, Sinfon\u00edaRx, RxCompanion, PrescribeWellness, and DoseMeRx. The MedWise HealthCare segment revenue model is primarily based on payments on a PMPM basis, payments on a subscription basis, and payments on a fee-for-service basis for each clinical intervention.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our MedWise HealthCare segment served more than 280 health plans and approximately 14,000 retail pharmacies.\nOur total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $297.2 million and $284.7 million, respectively. We incurred a net loss of $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and net loss of $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.8 million compared to $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA\" for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, why we present Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net losses to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe face a variety of challenges and risks, which we will need to address and manage as we pursue our growth strategy. In particular, we will need to continue to innovate in the face of a rapidly changing healthcare landscape if we are to remain competitive. We will also need to effectively manage our growth, especially related to our expansion beyond the PACE and post-acute markets to other at-risk providers and payers. Our senior management continuously focuses on these and other challenges, and we believe that our culture of innovation and our history of growth and expansion will contribute to the success of our business. We cannot, however, assure you that we will be successful in addressing and managing the many challenges and risks that we face.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate and manage our business. These metrics are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 297,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 284,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 12,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80,966)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32,436)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48,530)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (150)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,146)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (43)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe monitor the key metrics set forth in the preceding table to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and gauge our cash generation. We discuss Adjusted EBITDA in more detail in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA.\" We also monitor revenue retention rate described as follows.\nNet Revenue Retention\nWe believe that our ability to retain revenue associated with new or existing client relationships is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value we provide to our clients. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as net revenue retention. We calculate our net revenue retention by comparing revenue by client and segment at the end of the most recent calendar year divided by revenue at the end of the prior calendar year from only clients that were contracted with us at the end of the prior calendar year. We believe net revenue retention is a more meaningful metric versus prior disclosures, such as client retention, as this figure captures our cross-sell success, client expansion, changes in pricing, and client churn or downgrades.\nExcluding the impact of the Personica acquisition, we generated net revenue retention of 111% at our PACE clients during 2020, driven by census growth at existing clients and cross-sell revenue. Our MedWise HealthCare segment generated net revenue retention of 73% in 2020 compared to 119% in 2019. The decline in the 2020 MedWise HealthCare net revenue retention was primarily due to consolidation in the health plan industry, which redirected MTM work previously delivered by us, new restrictions related to comprehensive medications reviews completed with caregivers and prescribers, which temporarily slowed patient engagement during the year, and fewer adherence programs resulting from higher adherence rates in 2020 due to health plan actions taken to respond to COVID-19 earlier this year.\nFactors Affecting our Future Performance\nWe believe that our future success will be dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with existing clients, expand our client base, continue to enter new markets and expand our offerings to meet evolving market needs. While these areas present significant opportunities, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results. See the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may impact our future success.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, announced a global health emergency caused by a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, or the COVID-19 outbreak, and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The full impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we are uncertain as to the full magnitude of the impact that the pandemic will have on our financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the global situation and the ramification on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global responses to curb its spread, we are not able to estimate the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for 2021. However, we are dependent on our workforce to sell and deliver our products and services. Social distancing and shelter-in-place directives could impact our ability to deploy our workforce effectively. These same developments may affect the operations of our suppliers and customers, as their own workforces and operations are disrupted by the spread of this virus.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced challenges with revenue growth. The pandemic has delayed the closing of contracts across both our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare segments and, in some cases, shifted project priorities and timelines, which we believe resulted in fewer new business wins relative to our original expectations. Overall census growth for PACE has remained below historical levels, which has affected the Company's CareVention HealthCare segment growth as our segment revenue growth is largely driven by organic census increases at our existing PACE organizations. We are closely monitoring the ongoing pandemic in terms of infection and death rates, the latter of which spiked in the month of May and again increased at the end of 2020, negatively impacting our overall census figures. Our MedWise HealthCare segment also has experienced delays in the timing of implementation and closing of new business, as well as a negative impact from COVID-19 on medication adherence initiatives, which are seasonally weighted toward the second half of the calendar year. The continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change depending on factors such as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. We did not see material delays in scheduled PACE center openings during 2020. Accordingly, we believe that our current backlog of new extension centers and new PACE organizations under contract to open over the next 12 months could represent in excess of $75 million in annual revenue when the centers are operating at full capacity, which typically takes two to three years once a PACE center has opened its doors. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our results and financial position will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and difficult to predict, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken to contain it or address its impact, and the availability and widespread distribution and use of effective vaccines.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisitions\nOn October 5, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Personica, a provider of pharmacy services, including 340B and Medicare Part D administration solutions for PACE. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $10.0 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments; (ii) the issuance of 555,555 shares of our common stock; and (iii) promissory notes, or the Notes, for the payment of (a) $7.5 million in cash, which was paid in January 2021, (b) $5.5 million in cash within two business days following April 1, 2021, and (c) $4 million in cash within two business days following October 5, 2021. We may set-off amounts due under the Notes to the extent we are entitled to indemnification under the related purchase agreement or in respect of adjustments to the purchase price.\nWe account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, based on estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. The results of operations from the acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nFinancing\nOn December 18, 2020, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Western Alliance Bank, or the 2020 Credit Facility, which provides for a $120.0 million secured revolving credit facility, with a $1.0 million sublimit for cash management services and letters of credit and foreign exchange transactions. The 2020 Credit Facility replaced the previous line of credit agreement with Western Alliance Bank, or the 2015 Line of Credit, which matured on December 6, 2020. The 2020 Credit Facility bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% and matures on May 16, 2025. The 2020 Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens, merge or consolidate, make dispositions, pay dividends or make distributions, make investments, pay any subordinated indebtedness, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or make capital expenditures. The 2020 Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants, including (i) maintaining unrestricted cash balances with Western Alliance Bank, plus amounts available for draw under the credit facility of at least $10.0 million at all times, and (ii) maintaining a leverage ratio of less than 3.00:1.00, on a trailing twelve-month basis, measured quarterly. The obligations under the 2020 Credit Facility are secured by all of our Company's assets, as set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement.\nCorporate Reorganization\nEffective January 1, 2020, in order to facilitate the administration, management, and development of our business and minimize the burden on our tax and regulatory reporting obligations, we implemented a reorganization pursuant to which all of our domestic subsidiaries, other than CK Solutions, LLC, merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary CareKinesis, Inc., which had previously changed its legal name on December 20, 2019 to TRHC OpCo, Inc. In the second quarter of 2020, TRHC OpCo, Inc. further changed its name to Tabula Rasa HealthCare Group, Inc., or the TRHC Group. Following such reorganization, our only directly owned subsidiary is TRHC Group, which is the parent of CK Solutions, LLC, three foreign subsidiaries related to the acquisition of DoseMe, and Personica. In conjunction with our reorganization, we now operate our business through two segments, CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is derived from our product sales and service activities under our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare segments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, product sales represented 57% and 48% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, service revenue represented 43% and 52% of our total revenue, respectively.\nCareVention HealthCare\nPACE Product Revenue\nWe provide medication fulfillment pharmacy services to PACE organizations, and, while the majority of medications are routinely filled in order to treat chronic conditions, the mix and quantity of medications can vary. Revenue from medication fulfillment services is generally billed monthly or weekly, depending on whether the PACE organization is contracted with a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), and recognized when medications are delivered and control has passed to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nPACE Solutions\nWe provide services to PACE organizations, and these services primarily include medication safety services and health plan management services, which consist of risk adjustment services, PBM solutions, electronic health records solutions, and third party administration services. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of a fixed monthly fee assessed based on number of members served, or per member per month, a fee for each claim adjudicated, and subscription fees. These fees are recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide PACE services, which occurs when our clients have access to the PACE services. We generally bill for PACE services on a monthly basis as the services are provided.\nMedWise HealthCare\nProduct Revenue\nWe provide COVID-19 test kits to pharmacies and other clients. Revenue from the sale of these products is generally billed when test kits are shipped and is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligations to deliver the test kits and provide the test results. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nMedication Safety Services\nWe provide medication safety services, which include identification of high-risk individuals, medication regimen reviews including patient and prescriber counseling, and targeted interventions to increase adherence and close gaps in care. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of per member per month fees and fees for each medication review and assessment completed. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide medication safety services, which occurs when our clients have access to the medication safety services, and when medication reviews and assessments are completed. We generally bill for the medication safety services on a monthly basis.\nSoftware Subscription and Services\nWe provide software as a service, or SaaS, solutions, which allow for the identification of individuals with high medication-related risk, for patient communication and engagement, for documentation of clinical interventions, for optimizing medication therapy, for targeting adherence improvement, and for precision dosing. Revenues related to these software services primarily consist of monthly subscription fees and are recognized monthly as we meet our performance obligation to provide access to the software. Revenue for implementation and set up services is generally recognized over the contract term as the software services are provided. We generally bill for the software services on a monthly basis.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nProduct Cost\nCost of product revenue includes all costs directly related to the fulfillment and distribution of medications under our CareVention HealthCare offerings. Costs consist primarily of the purchase price of the medications we dispense. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, medication costs represented 79% of our total product costs. In addition to costs incurred to purchase the medications we dispense, other costs include shipping; packaging; expenses associated with operating our medication fulfillment centers, including salaries and related costs, such as stock-based compensation for personnel; technology expenses; direct overhead expenses; and allocated indirect overhead costs. We allocate indirect overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nService Cost\nCost of service revenue includes all costs directly related to servicing our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare service contracts, which primarily consist of labor costs, including stock-based compensation; outside contractors; expenses related to supporting our software platforms; direct overhead expenses; and allocated indirect overhead costs. We allocate indirect overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our research and development functions. This personnel includes software engineers and employees engaged in scientific research, healthcare analytics, and the design and development of new scientific algorithms and the enhancement of our software and technology platforms; fees paid to third-party consultants; costs related to quality assurance and testing; and other allocated facility-related overhead and expenses.\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with obtaining or developing the proprietary software platforms that support our product and service contracts, including third-party contractors and payroll costs for employees directly involved with the software development. Capitalized software development costs are amortized beginning when the software project is substantially complete and the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and applications to increase the functionality and enhance the ease of use of our existing suite of software solutions.\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our research and development efforts to further strengthen and enhance our software solutions and service offerings, but will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term as we expect our revenue to increase at a greater rate than such expenses.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries, commissions, bonuses, and stock-based compensation and employee benefits for sales, marketing, and account management personnel, as well as travel costs related to sales, marketing, and account management activities. Marketing costs also include costs for communication and branding materials, conferences, trade shows, public relations, and allocated overhead.\nWe expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we strategically invest to grow our sales, account management, and marketing infrastructure as we introduce new products and enter new markets, but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, for employees who are responsible for information systems, administration, human resources, finance, strategy, legal and executive management as well as other corporate expenses associated with these functional areas. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand our infrastructure and continue to comply with the requirements applicable to public companies, but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term.\nChange in Fair Value of Acquisition-related Contingent Consideration\nWe classify our acquisition-related contingent consideration as a liability. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date. Any change in the fair value of such acquisition-related contingent consideration is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a change in fair value of the liability. We adjust the carrying value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration until the contingency is finally determined or final payment is made.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Charge\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. When an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, we compare forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted\nfuture cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investment in equipment, our capitalized software, and our acquisition-related intangibles.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is primarily attributable to interest expense associated with our 2026 Convertible Notes, our 2015 Line of Credit and 2020 Credit Facility, the promissory notes related to the Personica acquisition purchase consideration, and our finance lease obligations. It also includes the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our various debt arrangements.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and

31, 2020. New business acquired from the Personica acquisition contributed approximately $1.8 million to the increase. New CareVention HealthCare clients that started services after January 2019 contributed $8.4 million to the increase. Increased medication fulfillment volume from growth in the number of patients served by our existing clients, medication mix of prescriptions filled, and payer mix contributed $11.1 million to the increase. The increase in product revenue was also due to $1.2 million of revenue generated from the sale of COVID-19 test kits in 2020 through our CareVention HealthCare segment and PrescribeWellness pharmacy network.\nService Revenue\nService revenue decreased $10.0 million, or 7%, from $147.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $137.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nService revenues generated by our MedWise HealthCare segment decreased by $11.6 million, or 11%, to $90.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $101.7 million for the same period in 2019. We experienced a $14.6 million decrease in medication safety services driven by the completion of fewer comprehensive medication reviews during the year ended December 31, 2020. The reduction was primarily due to consolidation in the health plan industry, which reduced MTM volumes required by a couple larger clients, as well as new restrictions related to comprehensive medications reviews completed with caregivers and prescribers, which temporarily slowed patient engagement during the year. Also, we experienced fewer adherence programs resulting from higher adherence rates in 2020 due to health plan actions taken to respond to COVID-19 earlier this year. In addition, data analytics fees earned were down $5.5 million due to a new contract with our data aggregation partner, which began in the first quarter of 2020. These decreases were offset by an increase in software subscription and software related services revenue of $8.4 million, which was primarily attributable to the PrescribeWellness acquisition completed on March 5, 2019.\nCareVention HealthCare service revenue increased by $1.7 million, or 4%, to $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. Lower fees earned from our data analytics contract negatively impacted revenue by $4.2 million. The acquisition of Personica in October 2020 contributed $1.7 million to the increase. Excluding these impacts, CareVention HealthCare service revenues increased $4.2 million. The increase was a result of new clients and growth with existing clients added since January 2019.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue increased $14.8 million, or 14%, from $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $117.2 million for the comparable period in 2020. New business acquired from the Personica acquisition contributed approximately $1.7 million to the increase. New CareVention HealthCare clients that started services after January 2019 contributed $4.8 million to the increase. In addition, increased medication volume from growth in the number of patients served by our existing customers, manufacturer price increases, and medication mix of prescriptions filled for our clients contributed approximately $5.0 million to the change. This was partially offset by a decrease in the acquisition cost of medications from our new purchasing agreement with Thrifty Drug Stores of $1.1 million. The increase in cost of product revenue was also due to a $2.0 million increase in distribution charges related to higher shipping volume for the medications we fulfilled and $1.0 million of COVID-19 test kits sold to clients during the year ended December 31, 2020. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to increases in headcount to support our overall growth.\nCost of Service Revenue\nCost of service revenue increased $8.6 million, or 11%, from $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCost of service revenue related to our CareVention HealthCare segment increased $6.0 million, or 23%, to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. Of the total increase, $1.0 million related to the acquisition of Personica in October 2020. The remaining increase was attributable to investments in infrastructure in order to better scale the delivery of third party administrative services into markets outside of PACE.\nCost of service revenue related to our MedWise HealthCare segment increased $2.6 million, or 5%, to $56.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The acquisition of PrescribeWellness contributed $2.4 million to the total increase and primarily consisted of employee compensation and technology costs. Our MedWise HealthCare segment also experienced a $1.8 million increase in fees related to the higher utilization of community pharmacies to deliver clinical intervention services under our EMTM program, which in some cases drives increased levels of engagement in our high-risk target population. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in the use of contracted resources to deliver on medication safety services, primarily MTM, as well as reduced printing and postage expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased $3.6 million, or 16%, from $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was mostly due to a reduction of $1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, primarily related to performance-based equity awards and common stock awarded during 2019. The remaining decrease is primarily attributable to lower payroll costs as a result of the realignment of resources associated with our Company's reorganization in January 2020 to better support our customers and business objectives.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $3.7 million, or 15%, from $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease includes $5.0 million of employee compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel previously included in sales and marketing, who are now dedicated to corporate strategy and executive leadership initiatives and are recorded in general and administrative expenses. The change in allocation resulted from our Company's reorganization in January 2020 to better align resources in order to support the achievement of our business objectives. This decrease was offset by an increase of $1.3 million as a result of the acquisition of PrescribeWellness toward the end of the first quarter of 2019, which primarily related to employee compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $14.5 million, or 28%, from $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $65.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquisitions of Personica and PrescribeWellness contributed $429 thousand to the increase in expenses, which consisted primarily of employee compensation costs, including stock compensation, information technology expenses, business insurance costs, and rent and utilities expenses. Excluding costs related to the acquisitions, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $14.1 million.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation costs of $15.7 million, which included an $8.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to equity awards granted during 2020. The increase in employee compensation costs was also due to the realignment of resources dedicated to service administrative functions to support the achievement of our business objectives as a result of our Company's reorganization in January 2020. The realignment included moving resources accounting for $5.0 million to corporate strategy and executive leadership roles from sales and marketing, and $2.5 million from the transition of key employees, previously included in cost of revenues, to executive roles. Additional headcount to support the overall growth of our operations contributed $1.3 million to the increase in compensation costs, which was offset by a $1.8 million reduction in bonus expense. The remaining increases were due to higher technology-related expenses and business insurance costs. These increases in general and administrative expenses were offset by a decrease in acquisition-related costs of $2.6 million due to the larger acquisition of PrescribeWellness in the first quarter of 2019.\nAcquisition-related Contingent Consideration Expense\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a $2.6 million and $3.8 million charge, respectively, related to the fair value adjustments of our acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we elected to accelerate the payment of the acquisition-related contingent consideration associated with our Cognify acquisition for an aggregate payment of $13.4 million, which was partially satisfied by a cash payment of $6.4 million and partially satisfied by the issuance of 135,434 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $6.9 million. In the first quarter of 2021, we made a final cash payment of $166 thousand in full satisfaction of the remaining acquisition-related contingent consideration liability. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $2.6 million charge to increase the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration primarily due to the accelerated payment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $3.0 million charge to increase the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration primarily due to an amendment of certain definitions used in the calculation of the contingent consideration set forth in the stock purchase agreement, and the decreased discount period to the final measurement date. The Cognify contingent\nconsideration was based on a multiple of the excess of Cognify's 2021 revenues and EBITDA over its 2018 revenues and EBITDA, as defined in the stock purchase agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we also recognized an aggregate $817 thousand charge related to fair value adjustments for the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisition-related contingent considerations, which were all subsequently paid in full during 2019.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Charge\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $5.0 million intangible asset impairment charge related to certain intangible assets obtained from the Medliance acquisition in 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we became aware of changes in circumstances impacting the future performance of our pharmacy cost management services and evaluated the recoverability of the related intangible assets by comparing their carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets to determine if the carrying value is not recoverable. The recoverability test indicated that certain customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets were impaired. As a result, we used an income approach to measure the fair value of the intangible assets and recognized non-cash impairment charges of $3.8 million and $1.2 million to the customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $10.8 million, or 31%, from $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to a $5.3 million increase in the amortization of capitalized software related to new software functionality placed into service since 2019 to support our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare segments. Amortization expense also increased by $2.2 million as a result of changes in the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets, $2.1 million as a result of intangible assets from PrescribeWellness in March 2019, and $625 thousand as a result of intangible assets from the Personica acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2020. Depreciation expense increased by $603 thousand primarily related to the completion of expanded office space at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters, the purchase of additional equipment for our pharmacy in Moorestown, New Jersey, and the completion of our research facility in Lake Nona, Florida during the third quarter of 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $4.7 million from $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in interest expense related to the 2026 Convertible Notes, which were issued in February 2019 and $440 thousand of interest expense on acquisition-related notes payable related to the Personica acquisition on October 4, 2020. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $220 thousand on the 2015 Line of Credit and 2020 Credit Facility.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $5.2 million and $16.2 million, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 6.0% and 33.3%, respectively. The benefit primarily consists of the benefit generated by the Company's losses, the benefit from windfall tax benefits generated from the vesting of restricted stock, disqualifying dispositions, and exercising of nonqualified stock options during the period, offset by other tax expense due to the increase in the Company's valuation allowance.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information about our financial results, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net loss plus certain other expenses, which include interest expense, benefit for income tax, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense, intangible asset impairment charge, severance expense incurred in 2020 in connection with the Company's reorganization, severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018, acquisition-related expense, and stock-based compensation related expense. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is one of the measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance, and we consider it an important supplemental measure of performance. We believe this metric is commonly used by the financial community, and we present it to enhance investors' understanding of our operating performance and cash flows. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations.\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u25cf as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; \n \u25cf to prepare and approve our annual budget; and \n \u25cf to develop short- and long-term operational plans. \nAdjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. As a non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In particular:\n \u25cf although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash interest income or expense; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect severance-related payments related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect severance-related payments incurred in 2020 in connection with the Company's reorganization; and \n \u25cf other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP financial results and not in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. You should be\naware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss for the periods presented:\nTable 204: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (80,966)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (32,436)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (47,269)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 906\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,168)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,199)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,376)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,802\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,468\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible asset impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 390\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,901\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation related expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,499\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 21,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 37,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,321\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Diluted Net (Loss) Income Per Share, or Adjusted Diluted EPS\nAdjusted Diluted EPS excludes the impact of certain items and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe the exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying operations, results, and trends; allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry; and enables more consistency with our expected capital structure on a going forward basis. Our management uses this measure along with corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as net loss before fair value adjustments for acquisition-related contingent consideration, intangible asset impairment charge, amortization of acquired intangibles, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, severance expense incurred in 2020 in connection with the Company's reorganization, severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018, acquisition-related expense, stock-based compensation related expense, and the tax impact of those items using a normalized tax rate on pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for those items expressed on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue.\nAdjusted Diluted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. In the future, we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following table reconciles net loss per share on a diluted basis, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted Diluted EPS:\nTable 205: <table><tr><td>\n</td>

entirely or partly in cash. Under this method, the underlying shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS, except to the extent that the average stock price for the reporting period exceeds their conversion price of $69.95 per share. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no impact on diluted EPS from the convertible senior subordinated notes as the conversion price exceeded our average stock price. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe incurred net losses of $81.0 million, $32.4 million, and $47.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, debt service obligations, and strategic business acquisitions. We have funded our operations, working capital needs, and investments with cash generated through operations, issuance of stock, and borrowings under our credit facilities. At December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash of $23.4 million.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nTable 209: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (5,815)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 15,830\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28,734)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (180,925)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (43,808)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 208,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,577\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (18,049)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 21,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,599\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $81.0 million, $2.6 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the Cognify acquisition, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $5.1 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $93.5 million. These noncash items primarily included $45.0 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $32.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $13.6 million of amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts primarily related to the 2026 Convertible Notes, changes in net deferred taxes of $5.3 million, a $5.0 million intangible asset impairment charge, and a $2.6 million change in fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration. The change in operating assets and liabilities, net of the effect from acquisitions, was primarily due to an increase in client claims receivables and an increase in accounts receivable, which was attributable to growth in our CareVention HealthCare segment as a result of new clients and growth in existing clients, as well as timing of client payments. The change in operating assets and liabilities was also due to a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to lower accrued employee compensation costs. The change in operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to payments received related to prior year contract asset balances and non-trade receivable, and an increase in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of vendor payments.\nNet cash used by operating activities was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $32.4 million, $24.5 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisitions, changes in net deferred taxes of $16.4 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $8.8 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $76.3 million. The noncash items primarily included $34.3 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $27.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, $10.9 million of amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts primarily related to the 2026 Convertible Notes, and $3.8 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, Cognify, and DoseMe. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in prepaid and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets and an increase in prepaid information technology expenses. The change in operating assets and liabilities was also due to a decrease in accounts payable as a result of shorter payment terms with our new medication vendor, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of higher accrued employee compensation, contract liabilities related to our performance obligations for our services, and interest expense.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $47.3 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $10.0 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $73.1 million. The noncash items primarily included $49.5 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and Cognify, $16.8 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, and $10.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit of $3.6 million. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to revenues generated as a result of the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify acquisitions, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets related to estimated drug utilization fees in pharmacy cost management services and a decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued contract labor costs to support our MedWise HealthCare services, accrued employee related expenses, and client fund obligations acquired from the Peak PACE and Mediture acquisitions in 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and reflected $6.8 million paid in connection with the acquisition of Personica, net of cash acquired. In addition, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $18.8 million in software development costs for our CareVention Healthcare and MedWise HealthCare technologies. Net cash used in investing activities also consisted of $3.1 million in purchases of property, equipment, and leasehold improvements primarily related to equipment to support the pharmacy at our Moorestown, New Jersey location, improvements for our expanded office space at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters, and improvements for our new call center space in Tucson, Arizona to support our medication safety services.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $180.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and reflected $158.8 million paid in connection with the acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness, net of cash acquired. In addition, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $14.5 million in software development costs for our CareVention and MedWise HealthCare technologies, $7.5 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to equipment and improvements for our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters and our research facility in Lake Nona, Florida, and $1.2 million in connection with the purchase of developed technology to support our MedWise HealthCare services. Net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds received from the repayment of the $1.0 million note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd in 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and reflected $32.2 million, net of cash acquired, paid in connection with the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify. Net cash used in investing activities included $5.6 million of software development costs for our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare technologies. Net cash used in investing activities also included $5.0 million in purchases of property and equipment and in leasehold improvements, primarily related to new pharmacy dispensing equipment, equipment and improvements for our new office space in Tucson, Arizona for Sinfon\u00edaRx, and improvements for our spaces in Austin, Texas and Gainesville, Florida dedicated to our MedWise HealthCare service call centers. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included $1.0 million related to the note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and primarily reflected $10.0 million of borrowings on our 2020 Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of Personica, and $3.9 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was partially offset by $3.8 million of payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the Cognify acquisition, $3.0 million in payments for payroll taxes remitted to taxing authorities on behalf of employees for shares withheld from the net exercise of stock options during 2020, and $1.3 million in payments for debt financing costs.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily reflected gross proceeds of $325.0 million from the issuance of the 2026 Convertible Notes, $65.9 million from the proceeds of the warrant transactions and $3.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially offset by a payment of $101.7 million for the convertible hedge options entered into in connection with the offering of the 2026 Convertible Notes, a payment of $45.0 million to repay the amounts outstanding on the 2015 Line of Credit, $29.1 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisitions, $9.6 million in payments for debt financing costs, and $968 thousand in payments of long-term debt.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted of $45.0 million of borrowings on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line to fund the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify, $3.5 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, and $156 thousand received as a result of a disgorgement related to short swing profits. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was partially offset by $2.9 million in payments for the repurchase of common stock, a $1.6 million payment of contingent purchase price consideration related to our Medliance acquisition, $1.1 million in payments of long-term debt, and $539 thousand in payments for debt financing and costs associated with our common stock offering completed in December 2017.\nFunding Requirements\nOn December 18, 2020, we entered into the 2020 Credit Facility, which provides for a $120 million secured revolving credit facility, and matures on May 16, 2025. We have $109.9 million available for borrowings under our 2020 Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all related financial and operating covenants thereunder as of December 31, 2020. See Note 13 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to the 2020 Credit Facility.\nWe believe that our unrestricted cash of $23.4 million as of December 31, 2020, borrowing capacity under our 2020 Credit Facility, and cash flows from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least March 31, 2022. Our ability to maintain successful operations will depend on, among other things, new business, the retention of clients and the effectiveness of sales and marketing initiatives.\nWe may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financings. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion, or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>than 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>than 5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior subordinated notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 325,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 325,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration payments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related notes payable (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,535\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letter of credit (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 372,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 22,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 335,635\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Contingent consideration represents the future cash payments as of December 31, 2020 related to our acquisition of Cognify in 2018.

The letter of credit renews annually and expires in September 2027. \n (6) Effective December 2018, we entered into a vendor agreement to provide information technology related services that commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of $2.0 million in the first three years of the contract. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $234 thousand was remaining under the contract. In addition, effective January 1, 2020, we entered into an updated agreement with our data aggregation partner for our pharmacy cost management services, which commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of $30 thousand per month for 36 months. \nOur existing office lease agreements provide us with the option to renew and generally provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations.\nIn addition, effective March 2019, we entered into an Affiliated Pharmacy Agreement and Pharmaceutical Program Supply Agreement with Thrifty Drug Stores, Inc., which was replaced on July 1, 2020 by a new Affiliated Pharmacy Agreement and Pharmaceutical Program Supply Agreement, to provide us with the pharmaceutical products that we sell. The contract commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of 98% of our total prescription product requirements from Thrifty Drug Stores through September 2023.\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table and described above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe base this management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to: (i) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, (ii) the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities, (iii) the useful lives of long-lived assets (including definite-lived intangible assets), (iv) the evaluation of revenue recognition criteria, (v) the realizability of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets, (vi) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases, and (vii) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of convertible debt instruments and related equity-\nclassified conversion options. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. You should consider your evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations with these policies, judgments, and estimates in mind.\nWhile we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe provide technology-enabled solutions tailored toward the specific needs of healthcare organizations, including payers, providers, and pharmacies. These solutions can be integrated or provided on a standalone basis. Contracts generally have a term of one to five years and in some cases automatically renew at the end of the initial term. In most cases, clients may terminate their contracts with a notice period ranging from 0 to 180 days without cause, thereby limiting the term in which we have enforceable rights and obligations. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected in exchange for the goods or services.\nWe use the practical expedient not to account for significant financing components because the period between recognition and collection does not exceed one year for most of our contracts. We do not disclose the amount of variable consideration that we expect to recognize in future periods as the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of single performance obligation, and the terms of that variable consideration relate specifically to our efforts to transfer the distinct service, or to a specific outcome from transferring the distinct service. Our customers' contracts primarily include monthly fees associated with unspecified membership, claims, or medication safety reviews that fluctuate throughout the contract.\nCareVention HealthCare\nPACE Product Revenue\nWe provide medication fulfillment pharmacy services to PACE organizations, and, while the majority of medications are routinely filled in order to treat chronic conditions, the mix and quantity of medications can vary. Revenue from medication fulfillment services is generally billed monthly or weekly, depending on whether the PACE organization is contracted with a PBM, and recognized when medications are delivered and control has passed to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nPACE Solutions\nWe provide services to PACE organizations, and these services primarily include medication safety services and health plan management services, which consist of risk adjustment services, PBM solutions, electronic health records solutions, and third party administration services. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of a fixed monthly fee assessed based on number of members served, or per member per month, a fee for each claim adjudicated, and subscription fees. These fees are recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide PACE services, which occurs when our clients have access to the PACE services. We generally bill for PACE services on a monthly basis as the services are provided.\nMedWise HealthCare\nProduct Revenue\nWe provide COVID-19 test kits to pharmacies and other clients. Revenue from the sale of these products is generally billed when test kits are shipped and is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligations to deliver the test kits and provide the test results. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nMedication Safety Services\nWe provide medication safety services, which include identification of high-risk individuals, medication regimen reviews including patient and prescriber counseling, and targeted interventions to increase adherence and close gaps in care. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of per member per month fees and fees for each medication review and assessment completed. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide medication safety services, which occurs when our clients have access to the medication safety services, and when medication reviews and assessments are completed. We generally bill for the medication safety services on a monthly basis.\nSoftware Subscription and Services\nWe provide software as a service, or SaaS, solutions, which allow for the identification of individuals with high medication-related risk, for patient communication and engagement, for documentation of clinical interventions, for optimizing medication therapy, for targeting adherence improvement, and for precision dosing. Revenues related to these software services primarily consist of monthly subscription fees and are recognized monthly as we meet our performance obligation to provide access to the software. Revenue for implementation and set up services is generally recognized over the contract term as the software services are provided. We generally bill for the software services on a monthly basis.\nBusiness Combinations and Contingent Consideration\nAcquired businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the net assets acquired at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to contingent consideration are recorded to the balance sheet at the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values. The purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nWe account for contingent consideration in accordance with applicable guidance provided within the business combination accounting rules. As part of our consideration for the SRx, Peak PACE, Cognify and DoseMe acquisitions, we were contractually obligated to pay certain consideration resulting from the outcome of future events. Therefore, we are required to update our underlying assumptions each reporting period, based on new developments, and record such contingent consideration liabilities at fair value until the contingency is resolved. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recognized each reporting period and included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nExamples of critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets and contingent consideration include:\n \u25cf future expected cash flows from sales and acquired developed technologies; \n \u25cf the acquired company's trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company's portfolio; \n \u25cf the probability of meeting the future events; and \n \u25cf discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows. \nThese estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill consists of the excess purchase price over fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually. GAAP provides an entity an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the quantitative assessment. If this is the case, the quantitative impairment test is required. Factors we generally consider important in our qualitative assessment that could trigger a step-two impairment test include significant underperformance relative to expected operating trends, significant changes in the way assets are used, underutilization of our tangible assets, discontinuance of certain products by us or by our clients, changes in the competitive environment and significant negative industry or economic trends. If it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is not required. If the quantitative impairment test is required, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flows analysis.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill and determined that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than the carrying amount. Accordingly, no impairment loss was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Other Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of property and equipment, software development costs and definite-lived intangible assets. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, we compare forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows.\nAlthough we believe the carrying values of our long-lived assets are currently realizable, future events could cause us to conclude otherwise.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of new accounting standards.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion focuses on 2020 and 2019 financial condition and results of operations and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Similar discussion of our 2018 financial condition and results and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOverview\nWe are innovating and redefining the medication safety market and, creating solutions designed to empower pharmacists, providers, and patients to optimize medication regimens. Our advanced technology, MedWise\u2122, predicts and identifies the cause of medication-related problems, including adverse drug events, so healthcare professionals can minimize harm and reduce medication-related risks. Our software and services help improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations and lower healthcare costs. We also believe we have the most extensive clinical tele-pharmacy network in the United States. Our solutions are trusted by health plans and pharmacies nationwide to assist them in meeting value-based payment requirements. Our vision and mission are supported by our industry-recognized leadership team,\nour significant investments and collaborations to advance medication safety-related pharmacotherapy research and its application in clinical practice, and our culture.\nWe operate our business through two segments, CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare, which accounted for 69% and 31% of revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our CareVention HealthCare segment provides our clients, primarily PACE programs, with medication fulfillment services, cloud-based software, pharmacy benefit management solutions, and clinical pharmacist services at the point-of-care. Our MedWise HealthCare segment provides our clients with cloud-based pharmacy software and full-service clinical pharmacy programs.\nCareVention HealthCare\nCareVention HealthCare primarily services PACE, which is a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, sponsored program providing comprehensive medical and social services to adults age 55 and older who need a nursing facility level of care but can live safely in community settings. Our clients include ArchCare Senior Life, Trinity Health, Palm Beach PACE, and St. Paul's PACE. We go to market through a number of different brands, including CareKinesis, Capstone Risk Adjustment Services, PACElogic, TruChart, PeakTPA, PersonifilRx, and Pharmastar.\nOur largest CareVention HealthCare offering is our medication fulfillment services which are built around our novel and proprietary Medication Risk Mitigation Matrix, or MRM Matrix, designed to enable clinicians to increase patient safety, create individualized medication regimens, promote adherence, reduce total medication burden, and eliminate unnecessary prescriptions. Our medication fulfillment and reminder packaging services utilize the MRM Matrix technology to reduce medication-related risk for the high-cost, high-risk PACE population. The CareVention HealthCare suite of offerings also includes risk adjustment services, pharmacy benefit management solutions, cloud-based electronic health records solutions and third-party administration services, which are all specifically tailored to the PACE market.\nThe CareVention HealthCare segment revenue model is primarily based on payments on a per-member per-month, or PMPM, basis, payments on a subscription basis, payments on a transaction basis, and charges and dispensing fees for medication fulfillment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our CareVention HealthCare segment served more than 130 healthcare organizations.\nMedWise HealthCare\nOur MedWise HealthCare segment is primarily comprised of service offerings from our acquisitions of Sinfon\u00edaRx in September 2017 and PrescribeWellness in March 2019. As a result of these acquisitions, we are a leading provider of Medication Therapy Management, or MTM, software and services for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plans and also a leading provider of cloud-based patient engagement software and services to more than 14,000 pharmacies nationwide.\nMore than 280 health plans, including several Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations, Express Scripts, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, and WellCare, utilize our MedWise HealthCare solutions to execute a range of clinical programs. These programs support MTM, Enhanced MTM (a five-year Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Innovation Part D pilot that began January 1, 2017), Medicare Part D Star Ratings, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures, and post-hospital discharge care transitions through a combination of our nearly 30,000 PrescribeWellness network pharmacists and/or our clinical tele-pharmacy call centers across the country employing nearly 400 pharmacists. Within our MedWise HealthCare segment, we offer our cloud-based software and clinical pharmacist services through a number of different brands, including MedWise, Sinfon\u00edaRx, RxCompanion, PrescribeWellness, and DoseMeRx. The MedWise HealthCare segment revenue model is primarily based on payments on a PMPM basis, payments on a subscription basis, and payments on a fee-for-service basis for each clinical intervention.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our MedWise HealthCare segment served more than 280 health plans and approximately 14,000 retail pharmacies.\nOur total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $297.2 million and $284.7 million, respectively. We incurred a net loss of $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and net loss of $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.8 million compared to $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA\" for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, why we present Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net losses to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe face a variety of challenges and risks, which we will need to address and manage as we pursue our growth strategy. In particular, we will need to continue to innovate in the face of a rapidly changing healthcare landscape if we are to remain competitive. We will also need to effectively manage our growth, especially related to our expansion beyond the PACE and post-acute markets to other at-risk providers and payers. Our senior management continuously focuses on these and other challenges, and we believe that our culture of innovation and our history of growth and expansion will contribute to the success of our business. We cannot, however, assure you that we will be successful in addressing and managing the many challenges and risks that we face.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate and manage our business. These metrics are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry.\n\nWe monitor the key metrics set forth in the preceding table to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and gauge our cash generation. We discuss Adjusted EBITDA in more detail in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA.\" We also monitor revenue retention rate described as follows.\nNet Revenue Retention\nWe believe that our ability to retain revenue associated with new or existing client relationships is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value we provide to our clients. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as net revenue retention. We calculate our net revenue retention by comparing revenue by client and segment at the end of the most recent calendar year divided by revenue at the end of the prior calendar year from only clients that were contracted with us at the end of the prior calendar year. We believe net revenue retention is a more meaningful metric versus prior disclosures, such as client retention, as this figure captures our cross-sell success, client expansion, changes in pricing, and client churn or downgrades.\nExcluding the impact of the Personica acquisition, we generated net revenue retention of 111% at our PACE clients during 2020, driven by census growth at existing clients and cross-sell revenue. Our MedWise HealthCare segment generated net revenue retention of 73% in 2020 compared to 119% in 2019. The decline in the 2020 MedWise HealthCare net revenue retention was primarily due to consolidation in the health plan industry, which redirected MTM work previously delivered by us, new restrictions related to comprehensive medications reviews completed with caregivers and prescribers, which temporarily slowed patient engagement during the year, and fewer adherence programs resulting from higher adherence rates in 2020 due to health plan actions taken to respond to COVID-19 earlier this year.\nFactors Affecting our Future Performance\nWe believe that our future success will be dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with existing clients, expand our client base, continue to enter new markets and expand our offerings to meet evolving market needs. While these areas present significant opportunities, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results. See the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may impact our future success.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, announced a global health emergency caused by a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, or the COVID-19 outbreak, and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The full impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we are uncertain as to the full magnitude of the impact that the pandemic will have on our financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the global situation and the ramification on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global responses to curb its spread, we are not able to estimate the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for 2021. However, we are dependent on our workforce to sell and deliver our products and services. Social distancing and shelter-in-place directives could impact our ability to deploy our workforce effectively. These same developments may affect the operations of our suppliers and customers, as their own workforces and operations are disrupted by the spread of this virus.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced challenges with revenue growth. The pandemic has delayed the closing of contracts across both our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare segments and, in some cases, shifted project priorities and timelines, which we believe resulted in fewer new business wins relative to our original expectations. Overall census growth for PACE has remained below historical levels, which has affected the Company's CareVention HealthCare segment growth as our segment revenue growth is largely driven by organic census increases at our existing PACE organizations. We are closely monitoring the ongoing pandemic in terms of infection and death rates, the latter of which spiked in the month of May and again increased at the end of 2020, negatively impacting our overall census figures. Our MedWise HealthCare segment also has experienced delays in the timing of implementation and closing of new business, as well as a negative impact from COVID-19 on medication adherence initiatives, which are seasonally weighted toward the second half of the calendar year. The continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change depending on factors such as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. We did not see material delays in scheduled PACE center openings during 2020. Accordingly, we believe that our current backlog of new extension centers and new PACE organizations under contract to open over the next 12 months could represent in excess of $75 million in annual revenue when the centers are operating at full capacity, which typically takes two to three years once a PACE center has opened its doors. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our results and financial position will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and difficult to predict, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken to contain it or address its impact, and the availability and widespread distribution and use of effective vaccines.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisitions\nOn October 5, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Personica, a provider of pharmacy services, including 340B and Medicare Part D administration solutions for PACE. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $10.0 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments; (ii) the issuance of 555,555 shares of our common stock; and (iii) promissory notes, or the Notes, for the payment of (a) $7.5 million in cash, which was paid in January 2021, (b) $5.5 million in cash within two business days following April 1, 2021, and (c) $4 million in cash within two business days following October 5, 2021. We may set-off amounts due under the Notes to the extent we are entitled to indemnification under the related purchase agreement or in respect of adjustments to the purchase price.\nWe account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, based on estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. The results of operations from the acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nFinancing\nOn December 18, 2020, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Western Alliance Bank, or the 2020 Credit Facility, which provides for a $120.0 million secured revolving credit facility, with a $1.0 million sublimit for cash management services and letters of credit and foreign exchange transactions. The 2020 Credit Facility replaced the previous line of credit agreement with Western Alliance Bank, or the 2015 Line of Credit, which matured on December 6, 2020. The 2020 Credit Facility bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% and matures on May 16, 2025. The 2020 Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens, merge or consolidate, make dispositions, pay dividends or make distributions, make investments, pay any subordinated indebtedness, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or make capital expenditures. The 2020 Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants, including (i) maintaining unrestricted cash balances with Western Alliance Bank, plus amounts available for draw under the credit facility of at least $10.0 million at all times, and (ii) maintaining a leverage ratio of less than 3.00:1.00, on a trailing twelve-month basis, measured quarterly. The obligations under the 2020 Credit Facility are secured by all of our Company's assets, as set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement.\nCorporate Reorganization\nEffective January 1, 2020, in order to facilitate the administration, management, and development of our business and minimize the burden on our tax and regulatory reporting obligations, we implemented a reorganization pursuant to which all of our domestic subsidiaries, other than CK Solutions, LLC, merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary CareKinesis, Inc., which had previously changed its legal name on December 20, 2019 to TRHC OpCo, Inc. In the second quarter of 2020, TRHC OpCo, Inc. further changed its name to Tabula Rasa HealthCare Group, Inc., or the TRHC Group. Following such reorganization, our only directly owned subsidiary is TRHC Group, which is the parent of CK Solutions, LLC, three foreign subsidiaries related to the acquisition of DoseMe, and Personica. In conjunction with our reorganization, we now operate our business through two segments, CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is derived from our product sales and service activities under our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare segments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, product sales represented 57% and 48% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, service revenue represented 43% and 52% of our total revenue, respectively.\nCareVention HealthCare\nPACE Product Revenue\nWe provide medication fulfillment pharmacy services to PACE organizations, and, while the majority of medications are routinely filled in order to treat chronic conditions, the mix and quantity of medications can vary. Revenue from medication fulfillment services is generally billed monthly or weekly, depending on whether the PACE organization is contracted with a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), and recognized when medications are delivered and control has passed to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nPACE Solutions\nWe provide services to PACE organizations, and these services primarily include medication safety services and health plan management services, which consist of risk adjustment services, PBM solutions, electronic health records solutions, and third party administration services. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of a fixed monthly fee assessed based on number of members served, or per member per month, a fee for each claim adjudicated, and subscription fees. These fees are recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide PACE services, which occurs when our clients have access to the PACE services. We generally bill for PACE services on a monthly basis as the services are provided.\nMedWise HealthCare\nProduct Revenue\nWe provide COVID-19 test kits to pharmacies and other clients. Revenue from the sale of these products is generally billed when test kits are shipped and is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligations to deliver the test kits and provide the test results. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nMedication Safety Services\nWe provide medication safety services, which include identification of high-risk individuals, medication regimen reviews including patient and prescriber counseling, and targeted interventions to increase adherence and close gaps in care. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of per member per month fees and fees for each medication review and assessment completed. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide medication safety services, which occurs when our clients have access to the medication safety services, and when medication reviews and assessments are completed. We generally bill for the medication safety services on a monthly basis.\nSoftware Subscription and Services\nWe provide software as a service, or SaaS, solutions, which allow for the identification of individuals with high medication-related risk, for patient communication and engagement, for documentation of clinical interventions, for optimizing medication therapy, for targeting adherence improvement, and for precision dosing. Revenues related to these software services primarily consist of monthly subscription fees and are recognized monthly as we meet our performance obligation to provide access to the software. Revenue for implementation and set up services is generally recognized over the contract term as the software services are provided. We generally bill for the software services on a monthly basis.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nProduct Cost\nCost of product revenue includes all costs directly related to the fulfillment and distribution of medications under our CareVention HealthCare offerings. Costs consist primarily of the purchase price of the medications we dispense. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, medication costs represented 79% of our total product costs. In addition to costs incurred to purchase the medications we dispense, other costs include shipping; packaging; expenses associated with operating our medication fulfillment centers, including salaries and related costs, such as stock-based compensation for personnel; technology expenses; direct overhead expenses; and allocated indirect overhead costs. We allocate indirect overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nService Cost\nCost of service revenue includes all costs directly related to servicing our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare service contracts, which primarily consist of labor costs, including stock-based compensation; outside contractors; expenses related to supporting our software platforms; direct overhead expenses; and allocated indirect overhead costs. We allocate indirect overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our research and development functions. This personnel includes software engineers and employees engaged in scientific research, healthcare analytics, and the design and development of new scientific algorithms and the enhancement of our software and technology platforms; fees paid to third-party consultants; costs related to quality assurance and testing; and other allocated facility-related overhead and expenses.\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with obtaining or developing the proprietary software platforms that support our product and service contracts, including third-party contractors and payroll costs for employees directly involved with the software development. Capitalized software development costs are amortized beginning when the software project is substantially complete and the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and applications to increase the functionality and enhance the ease of use of our existing suite of software solutions.\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our research and development efforts to further strengthen and enhance our software solutions and service offerings, but will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term as we expect our revenue to increase at a greater rate than such expenses.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries, commissions, bonuses, and stock-based compensation and employee benefits for sales, marketing, and account management personnel, as well as travel costs related to sales, marketing, and account management activities. Marketing costs also include costs for communication and branding materials, conferences, trade shows, public relations, and allocated overhead.\nWe expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we strategically invest to grow our sales, account management, and marketing infrastructure as we introduce new products and enter new markets, but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, for employees who are responsible for information systems, administration, human resources, finance, strategy, legal and executive management as well as other corporate expenses associated with these functional areas. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand our infrastructure and continue to comply with the requirements applicable to public companies, but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term.\nChange in Fair Value of Acquisition-related Contingent Consideration\nWe classify our acquisition-related contingent consideration as a liability. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date. Any change in the fair value of such acquisition-related contingent consideration is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a change in fair value of the liability. We adjust the carrying value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration until the contingency is finally determined or final payment is made.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Charge\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. When an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, we compare forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted\nfuture cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investment in equipment, our capitalized software, and our acquisition-related intangibles.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is primarily attributable to interest expense associated with our 2026 Convertible Notes, our 2015 Line of Credit and 2020 Credit Facility, the promissory notes related to the Personica acquisition purchase consideration, and our finance lease obligations. It also includes the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our various debt arrangements.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue increased $22.5 million, or 16%, from $137.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $159.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. New business acquired from the Personica acquisition contributed approximately $1.8 million to the increase. New CareVention HealthCare clients that started services after January 2019 contributed $8.4 million to the increase. Increased medication fulfillment volume from growth in the number of patients served by our existing clients, medication mix of prescriptions filled, and payer mix contributed $11.1 million to the increase. The increase in product revenue was also due to $1.2 million of revenue generated from the sale of COVID-19 test kits in 2020 through our CareVention HealthCare segment and PrescribeWellness pharmacy network.\nService Revenue\nService revenue decreased $10.0 million, or 7%, from $147.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $137.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nService revenues generated by our MedWise HealthCare segment decreased by $11.6 million, or 11%, to $90.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $101.7 million for the same period in 2019. We experienced a $14.6 million decrease in medication safety services driven by the completion of fewer comprehensive medication reviews during the year ended December 31, 2020. The reduction was primarily due to consolidation in the health plan industry, which reduced MTM volumes required by a couple larger clients, as well as new restrictions related to comprehensive medications reviews completed with caregivers and prescribers, which temporarily slowed patient engagement during the year. Also, we experienced fewer adherence programs resulting from higher adherence rates in 2020 due to health plan actions taken to respond to COVID-19 earlier this year. In addition, data analytics fees earned were down $5.5 million due to a new contract with our data aggregation partner, which began in the first quarter of 2020. These decreases were offset by an increase in software subscription and software related services revenue of $8.4 million, which was primarily attributable to the PrescribeWellness acquisition completed on March 5, 2019.\nCareVention HealthCare service revenue increased by $1.7 million, or 4%, to $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. Lower fees earned from our data analytics contract negatively impacted revenue by $4.2 million. The acquisition of Personica in October 2020 contributed $1.7 million to the increase. Excluding these impacts, CareVention HealthCare service revenues increased $4.2 million. The increase was a result of new clients and growth with existing clients added since January 2019.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue increased $14.8 million, or 14%, from $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $117.2 million for the comparable period in 2020. New business acquired from the Personica acquisition contributed approximately $1.7 million to the increase. New CareVention HealthCare clients that started services after January 2019 contributed $4.8 million to the increase. In addition, increased medication volume from growth in the number of patients served by our existing customers, manufacturer price increases, and medication mix of prescriptions filled for our clients contributed approximately $5.0 million to the change. This was partially offset by a decrease in the acquisition cost of medications from our new purchasing agreement with Thrifty Drug Stores of $1.1 million. The increase in cost of product revenue was also due to a $2.0 million increase in distribution charges related to higher shipping volume for the medications we fulfilled and $1.0 million of COVID-19 test kits sold to clients during the year ended December 31, 2020. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to increases in headcount to support our overall growth.\nCost of Service Revenue\nCost of service revenue increased $8.6 million, or 11%, from $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCost of service revenue related to our CareVention HealthCare segment increased $6.0 million, or 23%, to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. Of the total increase, $1.0 million related to the acquisition of Personica in October 2020. The remaining increase was attributable to investments in infrastructure in order to better scale the delivery of third party administrative services into markets outside of PACE.\nCost of service revenue related to our MedWise HealthCare segment increased $2.6 million, or 5%, to $56.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The acquisition of PrescribeWellness contributed $2.4 million to the total increase and primarily consisted of employee compensation and technology costs. Our MedWise HealthCare segment also experienced a $1.8 million increase in fees related to the higher utilization of community pharmacies to deliver clinical intervention services under our EMTM program, which in some cases drives increased levels of engagement in our high-risk target population. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in the use of contracted resources to deliver on medication safety services, primarily MTM, as well as reduced printing and postage expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased $3.6 million, or 16%, from $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was mostly due to a reduction of $1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, primarily related to performance-based equity awards and common stock awarded during 2019. The remaining decrease is primarily attributable to lower payroll costs as a result of the realignment of resources associated with our Company's reorganization in January 2020 to better support our customers and business objectives.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $3.7 million, or 15%, from $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease includes $5.0 million of employee compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel previously included in sales and marketing, who are now dedicated to corporate strategy and executive leadership initiatives and are recorded in general and administrative expenses. The change in allocation resulted from our Company's reorganization in January 2020 to better align resources in order to support the achievement of our business objectives. This decrease was offset by an increase of $1.3 million as a result of the acquisition of PrescribeWellness toward the end of the first quarter of 2019, which primarily related to employee compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $14.5 million, or 28%, from $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $65.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquisitions of Personica and PrescribeWellness contributed $429 thousand to the increase in expenses, which consisted primarily of employee compensation costs, including stock compensation, information technology expenses, business insurance costs, and rent and utilities expenses. Excluding costs related to the acquisitions, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $14.1 million.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation costs of $15.7 million, which included an $8.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to equity awards granted during 2020. The increase in employee compensation costs was also due to the realignment of resources dedicated to service administrative functions to support the achievement of our business objectives as a result of our Company's reorganization in January 2020. The realignment included moving resources accounting for $5.0 million to corporate strategy and executive leadership roles from sales and marketing, and $2.5 million from the transition of key employees, previously included in cost of revenues, to executive roles. Additional headcount to support the overall growth of our operations contributed $1.3 million to the increase in compensation costs, which was offset by a $1.8 million reduction in bonus expense. The remaining increases were due to higher technology-related expenses and business insurance costs. These increases in general and administrative expenses were offset by a decrease in acquisition-related costs of $2.6 million due to the larger acquisition of PrescribeWellness in the first quarter of 2019.\nAcquisition-related Contingent Consideration Expense\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a $2.6 million and $3.8 million charge, respectively, related to the fair value adjustments of our acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we elected to accelerate the payment of the acquisition-related contingent consideration associated with our Cognify acquisition for an aggregate payment of $13.4 million, which was partially satisfied by a cash payment of $6.4 million and partially satisfied by the issuance of 135,434 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $6.9 million. In the first quarter of 2021, we made a final cash payment of $166 thousand in full satisfaction of the remaining acquisition-related contingent consideration liability. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $2.6 million charge to increase the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration primarily due to the accelerated payment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $3.0 million charge to increase the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration primarily due to an amendment of certain definitions used in the calculation of the contingent consideration set forth in the stock purchase agreement, and the decreased discount period to the final measurement date. The Cognify contingent\nconsideration was based on a multiple of the excess of Cognify's 2021 revenues and EBITDA over its 2018 revenues and EBITDA, as defined in the stock purchase agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we also recognized an aggregate $817 thousand charge related to fair value adjustments for the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisition-related contingent considerations, which were all subsequently paid in full during 2019.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Charge\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $5.0 million intangible asset impairment charge related to certain intangible assets obtained from the Medliance acquisition in 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we became aware of changes in circumstances impacting the future performance of our pharmacy cost management services and evaluated the recoverability of the related intangible assets by comparing their carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets to determine if the carrying value is not recoverable. The recoverability test indicated that certain customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets were impaired. As a result, we used an income approach to measure the fair value of the intangible assets and recognized non-cash impairment charges of $3.8 million and $1.2 million to the customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $10.8 million, or 31%, from $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to a $5.3 million increase in the amortization of capitalized software related to new software functionality placed into service since 2019 to support our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare segments. Amortization expense also increased by $2.2 million as a result of changes in the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets, $2.1 million as a result of intangible assets from PrescribeWellness in March 2019, and $625 thousand as a result of intangible assets from the Personica acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2020. Depreciation expense increased by $603 thousand primarily related to the completion of expanded office space at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters, the purchase of additional equipment for our pharmacy in Moorestown, New Jersey, and the completion of our research facility in Lake Nona, Florida during the third quarter of 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $4.7 million from $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in interest expense related to the 2026 Convertible Notes, which were issued in February 2019 and $440 thousand of interest expense on acquisition-related notes payable related to the Personica acquisition on October 4, 2020. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $220 thousand on the 2015 Line of Credit and 2020 Credit Facility.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $5.2 million and $16.2 million, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 6.0% and 33.3%, respectively. The benefit primarily consists of the benefit generated by the Company's losses, the benefit from windfall tax benefits generated from the vesting of restricted stock, disqualifying dispositions, and exercising of nonqualified stock options during the period, offset by other tax expense due to the increase in the Company's valuation allowance.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information about our financial results, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net loss plus certain other expenses, which include interest expense, benefit for income tax, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense, intangible asset impairment charge, severance expense incurred in 2020 in connection with the Company's reorganization, severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018, acquisition-related expense, and stock-based compensation related expense. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is one of the measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance, and we consider it an important supplemental measure of performance. We believe this metric is commonly used by the financial community, and we present it to enhance investors' understanding of our operating performance and cash flows. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations.\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u25cf as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; \n \u25cf to prepare and approve our annual budget; and \n \u25cf to develop short- and long-term operational plans. \nAdjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. As a non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In particular:\n \u25cf although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash interest income or expense; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect severance-related payments related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect severance-related payments incurred in 2020 in connection with the Company's reorganization; and \n \u25cf other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP financial results and not in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. You should be\naware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss for the periods presented:\n\nAdjusted Diluted Net (Loss) Income Per Share, or Adjusted Diluted EPS\nAdjusted Diluted EPS excludes the impact of certain items and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe the exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying operations, results, and trends; allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry; and enables more consistency with our expected capital structure on a going forward basis. Our management uses this measure along with corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as net loss before fair value adjustments for acquisition-related contingent consideration, intangible asset impairment charge, amortization of acquired intangibles, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, severance expense incurred in 2020 in connection with the Company's reorganization, severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018, acquisition-related expense, stock-based compensation related expense, and the tax impact of those items using a normalized tax rate on pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for those items expressed on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue.\nAdjusted Diluted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. In the future, we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following table reconciles net loss per share on a diluted basis, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted Diluted EPS:\n\n (1) The impact to taxes was calculated using a normalized statutory tax rate applied to pre-tax income or loss adjusted for the respective items above and then subtracting or adding the tax provision or benefit, respectively, as determined for GAAP purposes. \nThe following table reconciles the diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used to calculate net loss per share on a diluted basis for GAAP purposes to the diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used to calculate Adjusted Diluted EPS:\n\n (1) We account for the convertible senior subordinated notes utilizing the Treasury Stock Method as we intend to settle the notes entirely or partly in cash. Under this method, the underlying shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS, except to the extent that the average stock price for the reporting period exceeds their conversion price of $69.95 per share. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no impact on diluted EPS from the convertible senior subordinated notes as the conversion price exceeded our average stock price. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe incurred net losses of $81.0 million, $32.4 million, and $47.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, debt service obligations, and strategic business acquisitions. We have funded our operations, working capital needs, and investments with cash generated through operations, issuance of stock, and borrowings under our credit facilities. At December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash of $23.4 million.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $81.0 million, $2.6 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the Cognify acquisition, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $5.1 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $93.5 million. These noncash items primarily included $45.0 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $32.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $13.6 million of amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts primarily related to the 2026 Convertible Notes, changes in net deferred taxes of $5.3 million, a $5.0 million intangible asset impairment charge, and a $2.6 million change in fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration. The change in operating assets and liabilities, net of the effect from acquisitions, was primarily due to an increase in client claims receivables and an increase in accounts receivable, which was attributable to growth in our CareVention HealthCare segment as a result of new clients and growth in existing clients, as well as timing of client payments. The change in operating assets and liabilities was also due to a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to lower accrued employee compensation costs. The change in operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to payments received related to prior year contract asset balances and non-trade receivable, and an increase in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of vendor payments.\nNet cash used by operating activities was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $32.4 million, $24.5 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisitions, changes in net deferred taxes of $16.4 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $8.8 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $76.3 million. The noncash items primarily included $34.3 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $27.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, $10.9 million of amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts primarily related to the 2026 Convertible Notes, and $3.8 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, Cognify, and DoseMe. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in prepaid and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets and an increase in prepaid information technology expenses. The change in operating assets and liabilities was also due to a decrease in accounts payable as a result of shorter payment terms with our new medication vendor, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of higher accrued employee compensation, contract liabilities related to our performance obligations for our services, and interest expense.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $47.3 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $10.0 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $73.1 million. The noncash items primarily included $49.5 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and Cognify, $16.8 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, and $10.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit of $3.6 million. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to revenues generated as a result of the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify acquisitions, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets related to estimated drug utilization fees in pharmacy cost management services and a decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued contract labor costs to support our MedWise HealthCare services, accrued employee related expenses, and client fund obligations acquired from the Peak PACE and Mediture acquisitions in 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and reflected $6.8 million paid in connection with the acquisition of Personica, net of cash acquired. In addition, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $18.8 million in software development costs for our CareVention Healthcare and MedWise HealthCare technologies. Net cash used in investing activities also consisted of $3.1 million in purchases of property, equipment, and leasehold improvements primarily related to equipment to support the pharmacy at our Moorestown, New Jersey location, improvements for our expanded office space at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters, and improvements for our new call center space in Tucson, Arizona to support our medication safety services.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $180.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and reflected $158.8 million paid in connection with the acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness, net of cash acquired. In addition, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $14.5 million in software development costs for our CareVention and MedWise HealthCare technologies, $7.5 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to equipment and improvements for our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters and our research facility in Lake Nona, Florida, and $1.2 million in connection with the purchase of developed technology to support our MedWise HealthCare services. Net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds received from the repayment of the $1.0 million note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd in 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and reflected $32.2 million, net of cash acquired, paid in connection with the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify. Net cash used in investing activities included $5.6 million of software development costs for our CareVention HealthCare and MedWise HealthCare technologies. Net cash used in investing activities also included $5.0 million in purchases of property and equipment and in leasehold improvements, primarily related to new pharmacy dispensing equipment, equipment and improvements for our new office space in Tucson, Arizona for Sinfon\u00edaRx, and improvements for our spaces in Austin, Texas and Gainesville, Florida dedicated to our MedWise HealthCare service call centers. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included $1.0 million related to the note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and primarily reflected $10.0 million of borrowings on our 2020 Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of Personica, and $3.9 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was partially offset by $3.8 million of payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the Cognify acquisition, $3.0 million in payments for payroll taxes remitted to taxing authorities on behalf of employees for shares withheld from the net exercise of stock options during 2020, and $1.3 million in payments for debt financing costs.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily reflected gross proceeds of $325.0 million from the issuance of the 2026 Convertible Notes, $65.9 million from the proceeds of the warrant transactions and $3.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially offset by a payment of $101.7 million for the convertible hedge options entered into in connection with the offering of the 2026 Convertible Notes, a payment of $45.0 million to repay the amounts outstanding on the 2015 Line of Credit, $29.1 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the Sinfon\u00edaRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisitions, $9.6 million in payments for debt financing costs, and $968 thousand in payments of long-term debt.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted of $45.0 million of borrowings on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line to fund the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify, $3.5 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, and $156 thousand received as a result of a disgorgement related to short swing profits. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was partially offset by $2.9 million in payments for the repurchase of common stock, a $1.6 million payment of contingent purchase price consideration related to our Medliance acquisition, $1.1 million in payments of long-term debt, and $539 thousand in payments for debt financing and costs associated with our common stock offering completed in December 2017.\nFunding Requirements\nOn December 18, 2020, we entered into the 2020 Credit Facility, which provides for a $120 million secured revolving credit facility, and matures on May 16, 2025. We have $109.9 million available for borrowings under our 2020 Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all related financial and operating covenants thereunder as of December 31, 2020. See Note 13 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to the 2020 Credit Facility.\nWe believe that our unrestricted cash of $23.4 million as of December 31, 2020, borrowing capacity under our 2020 Credit Facility, and cash flows from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least March 31, 2022. Our ability to maintain successful operations will depend on, among other things, new business, the retention of clients and the effectiveness of sales and marketing initiatives.\nWe may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financings. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion, or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\n\n (1) Contingent consideration represents the future cash payments as of December 31, 2020 related to our acquisition of Cognify in 2018. See Note 5 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n (2) Acquisition-related notes payable represents the future cash payments as of December 31, 2020 related to promissory notes for the purchase consideration of the Personica acquisition. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n (3) Finance lease obligations represent future lease payments for equipment including interest. \n (4) The operating lease obligations represent future lease payments for office space. \n (5) We are contingently liable for $100 thousand under an outstanding letter of credit related to our lease agreement for our corporate headquarters in Moorestown, New Jersey. The letter of credit renews annually and expires in September 2027. \n (6) Effective December 2018, we entered into a vendor agreement to provide information technology related services that commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of $2.0 million in the first three years of the contract. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $234 thousand was remaining under the contract. In addition, effective January 1, 2020, we entered into an updated agreement with our data aggregation partner for our pharmacy cost management services, which commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of $30 thousand per month for 36 months. \nOur existing office lease agreements provide us with the option to renew and generally provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations.\nIn addition, effective March 2019, we entered into an Affiliated Pharmacy Agreement and Pharmaceutical Program Supply Agreement with Thrifty Drug Stores, Inc., which was replaced on July 1, 2020 by a new Affiliated Pharmacy Agreement and Pharmaceutical Program Supply Agreement, to provide us with the pharmaceutical products that we sell. The contract commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of 98% of our total prescription product requirements from Thrifty Drug Stores through September 2023.\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table and described above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe base this management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to: (i) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, (ii) the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities, (iii) the useful lives of long-lived assets (including definite-lived intangible assets), (iv) the evaluation of revenue recognition criteria, (v) the realizability of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets, (vi) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases, and (vii) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of convertible debt instruments and related equity-\nclassified conversion options. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. You should consider your evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations with these policies, judgments, and estimates in mind.\nWhile we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe provide technology-enabled solutions tailored toward the specific needs of healthcare organizations, including payers, providers, and pharmacies. These solutions can be integrated or provided on a standalone basis. Contracts generally have a term of one to five years and in some cases automatically renew at the end of the initial term. In most cases, clients may terminate their contracts with a notice period ranging from 0 to 180 days without cause, thereby limiting the term in which we have enforceable rights and obligations. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected in exchange for the goods or services.\nWe use the practical expedient not to account for significant financing components because the period between recognition and collection does not exceed one year for most of our contracts. We do not disclose the amount of variable consideration that we expect to recognize in future periods as the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of single performance obligation, and the terms of that variable consideration relate specifically to our efforts to transfer the distinct service, or to a specific outcome from transferring the distinct service. Our customers' contracts primarily include monthly fees associated with unspecified membership, claims, or medication safety reviews that fluctuate throughout the contract.\nCareVention HealthCare\nPACE Product Revenue\nWe provide medication fulfillment pharmacy services to PACE organizations, and, while the majority of medications are routinely filled in order to treat chronic conditions, the mix and quantity of medications can vary. Revenue from medication fulfillment services is generally billed monthly or weekly, depending on whether the PACE organization is contracted with a PBM, and recognized when medications are delivered and control has passed to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nPACE Solutions\nWe provide services to PACE organizations, and these services primarily include medication safety services and health plan management services, which consist of risk adjustment services, PBM solutions, electronic health records solutions, and third party administration services. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of a fixed monthly fee assessed based on number of members served, or per member per month, a fee for each claim adjudicated, and subscription fees. These fees are recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide PACE services, which occurs when our clients have access to the PACE services. We generally bill for PACE services on a monthly basis as the services are provided.\nMedWise HealthCare\nProduct Revenue\nWe provide COVID-19 test kits to pharmacies and other clients. Revenue from the sale of these products is generally billed when test kits are shipped and is recognized as we satisfy our performance obligations to deliver the test kits and provide the test results. We do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nMedication Safety Services\nWe provide medication safety services, which include identification of high-risk individuals, medication regimen reviews including patient and prescriber counseling, and targeted interventions to increase adherence and close gaps in care. Revenue related to these services primarily consists of per member per month fees and fees for each medication review and assessment completed. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation to stand ready to provide medication safety services, which occurs when our clients have access to the medication safety services, and when medication reviews and assessments are completed. We generally bill for the medication safety services on a monthly basis.\nSoftware Subscription and Services\nWe provide software as a service, or SaaS, solutions, which allow for the identification of individuals with high medication-related risk, for patient communication and engagement, for documentation of clinical interventions, for optimizing medication therapy, for targeting adherence improvement, and for precision dosing. Revenues related to these software services primarily consist of monthly subscription fees and are recognized monthly as we meet our performance obligation to provide access to the software. Revenue for implementation and set up services is generally recognized over the contract term as the software services are provided. We generally bill for the software services on a monthly basis.\nBusiness Combinations and Contingent Consideration\nAcquired businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the net assets acquired at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to contingent consideration are recorded to the balance sheet at the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values. The purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nWe account for contingent consideration in accordance with applicable guidance provided within the business combination accounting rules. As part of our consideration for the SRx, Peak PACE, Cognify and DoseMe acquisitions, we were contractually obligated to pay certain consideration resulting from the outcome of future events. Therefore, we are required to update our underlying assumptions each reporting period, based on new developments, and record such contingent consideration liabilities at fair value until the contingency is resolved. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recognized each reporting period and included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nExamples of critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets and contingent consideration include:\n \u25cf future expected cash flows from sales and acquired developed technologies; \n \u25cf the acquired company's trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company's portfolio; \n \u25cf the probability of meeting the future events; and \n \u25cf discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows. \nThese estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill consists of the excess purchase price over fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually. GAAP provides an entity an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the quantitative assessment. If this is the case, the quantitative impairment test is required. Factors we generally consider important in our qualitative assessment that could trigger a step-two impairment test include significant underperformance relative to expected operating trends, significant changes in the way assets are used, underutilization of our tangible assets, discontinuance of certain products by us or by our clients, changes in the competitive environment and significant negative industry or economic trends. If it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is not required. If the quantitative impairment test is required, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flows analysis.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill and determined that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than the carrying amount. Accordingly, no impairment loss was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Other Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of property and equipment, software development costs and definite-lived intangible assets. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, we compare forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows.\nAlthough we believe the carrying values of our long-lived assets are currently realizable, future events could cause us to conclude otherwise.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of new accounting standards.

and 2019. The company aims to redefine medication safety through its MedWise\u2122 technology, which predicts medication-related problems. They operate through two segments: CareVention HealthCare (69% revenue) and MedWise HealthCare (31% revenue). CareVention primarily services the PACE market, offering medication fulfillment and various health-related services. MedWise offers Medication Therapy Management (MTM) and software services to health plans and pharmacies.\n\nKey financial metrics revealed total revenues of $297.2 million for 2020, up from $284.7 million in 2019. There was, however, a net loss of $81.0 million in 2020, widening from a net loss of $32.4 million in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for 2020 was $21.8 million, down from $37.9 million in 2019.\n\nChallenges for the company include the need to innovate in a rapidly changing healthcare environment and manage growth, especially beyond PACE and post-acute markets. The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on revenue growth, delaying contracts and affecting census growth for PACE.\n\nThe company views its ability to retain and grow client relationships, enter new markets, and expand offerings as crucial for future success. The company is closely monitoring the pandemic's impact on its financials, acknowledging uncertainty in their estimates for 2021 due to evolving conditions.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the company's cash flow from operating activities was $4.8 million, despite a significant net loss, due to additions of noncash items. They invested $28.7 million, primarily in software development, and had net cash of $5.9 million from financing activities.\n\nThe company believes its current cash, credit facility, and operating cash flow will fund operations through at least March 31, 2022. They plan to manage expenses and invest in infrastructure, research and development, sales, marketing, and potential strategic acquisitions to enhance growth and value creation."}
