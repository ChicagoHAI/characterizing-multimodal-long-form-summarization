Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report. As used herein, the terms we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to NexPoint Multifamily Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, NexPoint Multifamily Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as the OP,\u201d and to their subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe were formed on November 12, 2013 as a Maryland corporation that intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our Offering to directly or indirectly acquire, own, operate and selectively develop well-located core-plus multifamily properties with a modest value-add component, in large cities and suburban markets of large cities, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. We consider core-plus\u201d multifamily properties to be properties we believe are high quality, yet ones which we also believe possess the ability to increase in value through some event. Examples include properties that have scheduled vacancies or leases rolling over or that would benefit from modest upgrades or renovations that would allow us to increase rents. We expect the size of individual properties that we purchase to vary significantly, but we expect that most of the properties we acquire will have a purchase price between $20 million and $30 million. Our modest value-add component will consist, on average, of investing $1,000 - $4,000 per unit in the first 24 months of ownership, in an effort to add value to the asset's exterior and interior. Our modest value-add program will be implemented at the direction and supervision of our Advisor. In addition, we anticipate incurring average annual capital expenditures of $175,000 to $275,000 per multifamily property in connection with the ongoing operations of our business. Although we will monitor the adequacy of this average, we believe these figures to be sufficient to maintain the properties at a high level in the markets in which we operate. In most cases, we plan to escrow equity at the time we acquire an asset to fund these planned capital expenditures and value-add improvements.\nWe may also directly or indirectly acquire, on an opportunistic basis, core multifamily properties, although we do not expect this to be a substantial portion of our portfolio. We consider core multifamily properties to be properties that we believe are of the highest quality in historically strong markets that are easy to finance and generally do not require upgrades or renovations. We may also seek to invest in multifamily housing debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity in situations where the risk/return correlation is more attractive than investments in common equity. This strategy would be designed to minimize potential losses during market downturns and maximize risk adjusted total returns to our stockholders in all market cycles.\nOn August 12, 2015, the SEC declared effective our Registration Statement to offer a maximum of up to $1.0 billion in shares of common stock in our primary offering and up to $100 million in shares pursuant to our DRIP. We are publicly offering two classes of shares of common stock, Class A shares and Class T shares, in any combination up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different selling commissions, and there will be an ongoing distribution fee with respect to the primary offering of Class T shares. The initial offering price for the shares in the primary offering is $10.00 per Class A share and $9.35 per Class T share. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between our primary offering and our DRIP. We are also offering up to $100 million in shares of common stock pursuant to our DRIP at an initial price of $9.50 per Class A share and $8.88 per Class T share, which is 95% of the primary offering price.\nSubject to certain restrictions and limitations, the Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets. The Advisor and its personnel have no obligation to, but may present us with investment opportunities with a purchase price of less than $10.0 million. The Advisor's investment committee may purchase on our account, without specific prior approval of the Board, properties with a purchase price of $15.0 million or less, so long as the investment in the property would not, if consummated, violate our investment guidelines or any restrictions on indebtedness and the consideration to be paid for such properties does not exceed the fair market value of such properties. Any investment with a purchase price greater than $15.0 million or that, if consummated, would violate our investment guidelines or any restrictions on indebtedness, requires the approval of the Board.\nPursuant to the terms of our Offering, offering proceeds were held in an escrow account until we met the minimum offering amount of $2.0 million. On March 24, 2016, we raised the minimum offering amount and the Offering proceeds held in escrow were released to us. As of March 25, 2016, we had sold approximately 217,391 shares of Class A common stock in our Offering for gross proceeds of $2.0 million, or $9.20 per share, reflecting the fact that selling commissions and dealer manager fees were not paid in connection with the sale. As of December 31, 2015, we had sold 22,223 shares of our common stock to the Advisor for an aggregate purchase price of $200,000, or $9.00 per share, reflecting the fact that selling commissions and dealer manager fees were not paid in connection with the sale. These shares were subsequently renamed as shares of Class A common stock. The Advisor or any affiliate may not sell these shares while the Sponsor remains our sponsor but it may transfer the shares to other affiliates. We will offer shares of our common stock on a continuous basis until August 12, 2017, unless extended. However, in certain states the Offering may continue for only one year unless we renew the offering period for an additional year. We reserve the right to terminate our Offering at any time.\nSubstantially all of our assets will be held by the OP. We are the sole general partner and a limited partner of the OP. The special limited partner of the OP is the Advisor.\nAs we accept subscriptions for shares, we will transfer substantially all of the net proceeds of the Offering to the OP as a capital contribution, however, we will be deemed to have made capital contributions in the amount of the gross offering proceeds received from investors. The OP will be deemed to have simultaneously paid the costs associated with the Offering. If the OP requires additional funds at any time in excess of capital contributions made by us or from borrowing, we will borrow funds from a financial institution or other lender and lend such funds to the OP on the same terms and conditions as would be applicable to our borrowing of such funds. The limited partnership agreement of the OP provides that the OP will be operated in a manner that will enable us to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that the OP will not be classified as a publicly traded partnership\u201d for purposes of Section 7704 of the Code, which classification could result in the OP being taxed as a corporation. We will experience a relative increase in liquidity as additional subscriptions for shares of our common stock are received and a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate our assets.\nWe intend to make an election under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. If we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and may not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our qualification is denied unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our after-tax net income.\nWe will monitor the various qualification tests that we must meet to maintain our status as a REIT. Ownership of our shares will be monitored to ensure that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time after the first taxable year for which we make an election to be taxed as a REIT. We will also determine, on a quarterly basis, that the gross income, asset and distribution tests are met.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have not acquired any real estate investments or commenced material operations. However, as of March 24, 2016, we have accepted contributions of $2.2 million, broken escrow and have commenced material operations. Because we have not acquired any assets, we are not aware of any known trends or uncertainties material to our proposed operations, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, which may reasonably be anticipated to have a material impact on the capital resources and the revenue to be derived from the operation of our future assets.\nThe expenses incurred to date are primarily related to corporate general and administrative expenses, such as Board fees, directors and officers liability insurance and audit fees, that our Advisor has incurred on our behalf. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and for the period from November 12, 2013 (inception) to December 31, 2013, are not indicative of those expected in future periods. As we raise capital, we will make acquisitions of real estate and increase our borrowings, which will have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, or FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably overtime, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or is requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Additionally, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time. An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indicators exist and if the carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.\nHistorical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. However, FFO and MFFO, as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses. Our management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases. The Board, in consultation with our management, may determine that it is in our best interests to begin the process of considering alternatives with respect to a liquidity event (i.e., listing of its common stock on a national exchange, a merger or sale of us or another similar transaction) at such time during our offering stage as the Board can reasonably determine that all of the securities in the Offering will be sold within a reasonable time period (i.e. three to six months). Thus, we will not continuously purchase assets and will have a limited life.\nDue to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after the Offering has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after the Offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after the Offering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.\nOur MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition-related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses are paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which properties are acquired and will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired. MFFO that excludes such costs and expenses would only be comparable to non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activities and have similar operating characteristics as us. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. We view both gains and losses from dispositions of assets and fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance and calculating MFFO. While we are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of on-going operations. As disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report, the purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with those processes, are key operational features of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to investors. Acquisition fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by the Advisor if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares in the Offering, and therefore such fees and expenses may need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows.\nOur management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors. For example, acquisition costs are funded from the proceeds of the Offering and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.\nPresentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of its liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund its cash needs including its ability to make distributions to its stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in\nan offering such as the Offering (unless and until we calculate NAV prior to the close of the Offering) where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value and there is no NAV determination during the offering stage and for a period thereafter. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed. FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining FFO or MFFO. Since we had not begun operations as of the date of this Annual Report, we have not included a calculation of FFO or MFFO.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal demands for funds will be for property and real estate debt acquisitions, either directly or through investment interests, for the payment of operating expenses and distributions, and for the payment of interest on any outstanding indebtedness. Generally, cash needs for items other than property acquisitions will be met from operations, and cash needs for property acquisitions will be funded by our public offering of shares and debt. However, there may be a delay between the sale of our shares and our purchase of properties, which could result in a delay in the benefits to our stockholders, if any, of returns generated from our investment operations. As a result, we may increase leverage above our targeted level on a temporary basis in order to make current investments and then use proceeds from fundraising to lower the leverage. Over time, as we become established and the fundraising effort begins to scale, we do not expect our target leverage ratio to exceed 50% to 60% of the cost of our properties.\nThe Advisor will evaluate potential property acquisitions and engage in negotiations with sellers and lenders on our behalf. After a purchase contract is executed that contains specific terms, the property will not be purchased until the successful completion of due diligence, which includes review of the title insurance commitment, an appraisal and an environmental analysis. In some instances, the proposed acquisition will require the negotiation of final binding agreements, which may include financing documents. During this period, we may decide to temporarily invest any unused proceeds from the Offering in certain investments that could yield lower returns than properties we intend to acquire. These lower returns may affect our ability to make distributions.\nPotential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed modified funds from operations, or MFFO, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in case of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. We have not identified any sources of such financing.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe have not yet commenced material operations.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nOur cash used in investing activities will vary based on how quickly we raise funds in the Offering and how quickly we invest those funds towards acquisitions of real estate. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and for the period from November 12, 2013 (inception) to December 31, 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $0.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the Offering, net of distributions paid to our stockholders and the issuance of notes payable. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $0. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $199,900, which primarily related to a sale of 22,223 shares of our Class A common stock to our Advisor. During the period from November 12, 2013 (inception) to December 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $100, which related to our initial capitalization by an affiliate of our Advisor.\nObligations and Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding obligations or commitments that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIncome Taxes\nWe intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under the Code and intend to operate as such beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nDistributions\nThere were no distributions declared or paid during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWhen we have sufficient cash flow available to pay distributions, we intend to pay monthly distributions to our stockholders. As of the date of this Annual Report, we had no real estate investments. We will not make any real estate investments until we identify investment opportunities and raise sufficient capital pursuant to the Offering to do so. We cannot predict when we will begin to generate sufficient cash flow from these investments to pay distributions as a result of such investments. Because all of our operations will be performed indirectly through the OP, our ability to pay distributions depends on the OP's ability to pay distributions to its partners, including to us. If we do not have enough cash from operations to fund the distributions, we may borrow, issue additional securities or sell assets in order to fund the distributions or make the distributions out of net proceeds from the Offering. We have not established any limit on the amount of proceeds from the Offering that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus, unless our charter provides otherwise, senior liquidation preferences, if any.\nIn addition, the fees, distributions and reimbursements payable to the Advisor depend on various factors, including the assets we acquire, indebtedness incurred, and sales prices of investments sold, and therefore cannot be quantified or reserved for until such fees have been earned. We are required to pay these amounts to the Advisor regardless of the amount of cash we distribute to our stockholders and therefore our ability to make distributions from cash flow, as well as cash flow available for investment, to our stockholders may be negatively impacted.\nDistributions will be paid to our stockholders when and if authorized by the Board and declared by us out of legally available funds. We expect to declare and pay distributions on a monthly basis as of daily record dates. Distributions will be authorized at the discretion of the Board, which will be influenced in part by its intention to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code. We intend to make distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirement and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings; however, it may not always be possible to do so. Each distribution will be accompanied by a notice which sets forth: (a) the record date; (b) the amount per share that will be distributed; (c) the equivalent annualized yield; (d) the amount and percentage of the distributions paid from operations, offering proceeds and other sources; and (e) for those investors participating in the DRIP, a statement that a distribution statement will be provided in lieu of a check. The funds we receive from operations that are available for distribution may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the amount of time required for us to invest the funds received in the Offering;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our operating and interest expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> operating results of our properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the amount of distributions or dividends received by us from our indirect real estate investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our ability to keep our properties occupied;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> our ability to maintain or increase rental rates when renewing or replacing current leases;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> capital expenditures and reserves for such expenditures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the issuance of additional shares; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> financings and refinancings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe must annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, in order to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code. The Board may authorize distributions in excess of this percentage as it deems appropriate. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year, distributions may not reflect our income earned in that particular distribution period, but may be made in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period and may be made in advance of actual receipt of funds in an attempt to make distributions relatively uniform. To allow for such differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses, and the effect of required debt payments, among other things, we could be required to borrow funds from third parties on a short-term basis, issue new securities, or sell assets to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. These methods of obtaining funding could affect future distributions by increasing operating costs and decreasing available cash. In addition, such distributions may constitute a return of capital.\nDistributions in kind will not be permitted, except for:\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> distributions of readily marketable securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> distributions of beneficial interests in a liquidating trust established for our dissolution and the liquidation of our assets in accordance with the terms of our charter; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> distributions of in-kind property, so long as, with respect to such in-kind property, the Board advises each stockholder of the risks associated with direct ownership of the property, offers each stockholder the election of receiving in-kind property distributions, and distributes in- kind property only to those stockholders who accept the directors' offer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur share repurchase program, as described below, may provide eligible stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell shares back to us, subject to restrictions and applicable law, if such repurchases do not impair our capital or operations. Specifically, state securities regulators impose investor suitability standards that establish specific financial thresholds that must be met by any investor in certain illiquid, long-term investments, including REIT shares.\nUntil the NAV pricing date, except with respect to repurchases sought within one year of a stockholder's death or Qualifying Disability (as determined by the applicable governmental agency), common stockholders must hold their shares for at least one year in order to participate in our share repurchase program.\nPrior to the time the Advisor begins calculating NAV, the price per share that we will pay to repurchase shares of our common stock will be as follows:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least one year, the price will be the lower of $9.25 and 92.5% of the amount paid for each such share;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least two years, the price will be the lower of $9.50 and 95.0% of the amount paid for each such share;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least three years, the price will be the lower of $9.75 and 97.5% of the amount paid for each such share;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least four years, the price will be the lower of $10.00 and 100% of the amount paid for each such share;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nin each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of our share repurchase program, we intend to make repurchases, if requested, at least once quarterly. Each stockholder whose repurchase request is granted will receive the repurchase amount within 30 days after the fiscal quarter in which we grant the repurchase request. Subject to the limitations described in the prospectus, we also will repurchase shares upon the request of the estate, heir or beneficiary, as applicable, of a deceased stockholder. We will limit the number of shares repurchased pursuant to our share repurchase program in any calendar year to 5% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year. In addition, funds available for our share repurchase program are limited or described below and may not be sufficient to accommodate all requests. Due to these limitations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.\nFunding for the share repurchase program will be derived from proceeds we maintain from the sale of shares under the DRIP and other operating funds, if any, as our Board, in its sole discretion, may reserve for this purpose. We cannot guarantee that the funds set aside for the share repurchase program will be sufficient to accommodate all requests made each year. However, a stockholder may withdraw its request at any time or ask that we honor the request when funds are available. Pending repurchase requests will be honored on a pro rata basis.\nWhether the Advisor has begun NAV calculations or not, the share repurchase program will terminate immediately if our shares are listed on any national securities exchange. In addition, the Board may amend, suspend (in whole or in part) or terminate the share repurchase program at any time upon 30 days' notice. Further, the Board reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any requests for repurchases.\nDistribution Reinvestment Plan\nWe have adopted the DRIP. The following is a summary of the DRIP.\nInvestment of Distributions\nWe have adopted a DRIP pursuant to which our stockholders may elect to purchase shares of our common stock with our distributions. Distributions on Class A shares will be reinvested in Class A shares and distributions on Class T shares will be reinvested in Class T shares. We have the discretion to extend the offering period for the shares being offered under the DRIP beyond the termination of our primary offering until we have sold all the shares allocated to the DRIP. We also may offer shares under the DRIP pursuant to a new registration statement. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between our primary offering and the DRIP. Any shares issued pursuant to the DRIP are subject to registration and renewal in any state in which such shares are offered and the offering of such shares is not exempt under applicable laws and regulations. Until the NAV pricing date, we will offer shares under our DRIP at $9.50 per Class A Share and $8.88 per Class T Share, which is 95% of the primary offering price. Thereafter, we will offer shares under our DRIP at per share NAV.\nNo dealer manager fees or selling commissions or, with respect to Class T shares, distribution fees, will be paid with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the DRIP; therefore, we will retain all of the proceeds from the reinvestment of distributions.\nPursuant to the terms of the DRIP, the reinvestment agent, which currently is us, will act on behalf of participants to reinvest the cash distributions they receive from us. Stockholders participating in the DRIP may purchase fractional shares. If sufficient shares are not available for issuance under the DRIP, the reinvestment agent will remit excess cash distributions to the participants. Participants purchasing shares pursuant to the DRIP will have the same rights as stockholders with respect to shares purchased under the DRIP and will be treated in the same manner as if such shares were issued pursuant to the primary offering.\nElection to Participate or Terminate Participation\nA stockholder may become a participant in the DRIP by making a written election to participate on his or her subscription agreement at the time he or she subscribes for shares. Any stockholder who has not previously elected to participate in the DRIP may so elect at any time by delivering to the reinvestment agent a completed enrollment form or other written authorization required by the reinvestment agent. Participation in the DRIP will commence with the next distribution payable after receipt of the participant's notice, provided it is received at least ten days prior to the last day of the fiscal quarter, month or other period to which the distribution relates.\nSome brokers may determine not to offer their clients the opportunity to participate in the DRIP. Any prospective investor who wishes to participate in the DRIP should consult with his or her broker as to the broker's position regarding participation in the DRIP.\nWe reserve the right to prohibit qualified retirement plans and other benefit plan investors\u201d (as defined in ERISA) from participating in the DRIP if such participation would cause our underlying assets to constitute plan assets\u201d of qualified retirement plans. A material change shall include any anticipated or actual decrease in net worth or annual gross income or any other change in circumstances that would cause the stockholder to fail to meet the suitability standards set forth in our prospectus for the stockholder's initial purchase of shares of common stock.\nEach stockholder electing to participate in the DRIP shall notify the reinvestment agent if any time during his or her participation in the DRIP, there is any material change in the stockholder's financial condition or inaccuracy of any representation under the subscription agreement for such stockholder's initial purchase of our shares.\nSubscribers should note that affirmative action in the form of written notice to the reinvestment agent must be taken to withdraw from participation in the DRIP. A withdrawal from participation in the DRIP will be effective with respect to distributions for a distribution period only if written notice of termination is received at least ten days prior to the end of such distribution period. In addition, a transfer of shares prior to the date our shares are listed for trading on a national securities exchange, which we have no intent to do at this time and which may never occur, will terminate participation in the DRIP with respect to such transferred shares as of the first day of the distribution period in which the transfer is effective, unless the transferee demonstrates to the reinvestment agent that the transferee meets the requirements for participation in the plan and affirmatively elects to participate in the DRIP by providing to the reinvestment agent an executed enrollment form or other written authorization required by the reinvestment agent.\nOffers and sales of shares pursuant to the DRIP must be registered in every state in which such offers and sales are made and the offering of such shares is not exempt under applicable laws and regulations. Generally, such registrations are for a period of one year. Thus, we may have to stop selling shares pursuant to the DRIP in any states in which our registration is not renewed or extended.\nReports to Participants\nWithin 90 days after the end of each calendar year, the reinvestment agent will mail to each participant a statement of account describing, as to such participant, the distributions received, the number of shares purchased, the purchase price for such shares and the total shares purchased on behalf of the participant during the prior year pursuant to the DRIP.\nExcluded Distributions\nThe Board may designate that certain cash or other distributions attributable to net sales proceeds will be excluded from distributions that may be reinvested in shares under the DRIP, or Excluded Distributions. Accordingly, if proceeds attributable to the potential sale transaction described above are distributed to stockholders as an Excluded Distribution, such amounts may not be reinvested in our shares pursuant to the DRIP. The determination of whether all or part of a distribution will be deemed to be an Excluded Distribution is separate and unrelated to our requirement to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income. In its initial determination of whether to make a distribution and the amount of the distribution, the Board will consider, among other factors, our cash position and our distribution requirements as a REIT. Once the Board determines to make the distribution, it will then consider whether all or part of the distribution will be deemed to be an Excluded Distribution. In most instances, we expect that the Board would not deem any of the distribution an Excluded Distribution. In that event, the amount distributed to participants in the DRIP will be reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. If all or a portion of the distribution is deemed an Excluded Distribution, the distribution will be made to all stockholders, however, the excluded portion will not be reinvested. As a result, we would not be able to use any of the Excluded Distribution to assist in meeting future distributions and the stockholders would not be able to use the distribution to purchase additional shares of our common stock through the DRIP. We currently do not have any planned Excluded Distributions, which will only be made, if at all, in addition to, not in lieu of, regular distributions.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nTaxable participants will incur tax liability even though they have elected not to receive their distributions in cash but rather to have their distributions reinvested under the DRIP. In addition, to the extent our stockholders purchase shares through the DRIP at a discount to their fair market value, they will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving an additional distribution equal to the amount of the discount. Until such time as we calculate NAV, we will sell shares pursuant to the DRIP at $9.50 per Class A Share and $8.88 per Class T Share, which is 95% of the primary offering price, and expect the Board to estimate the fair value of a share of our common stock to be $10.00, the offering price in the primary offering. Additionally, at least until our offering stage is complete, we expect that no secondary trading market for our shares will develop. Therefore, at least until we calculate NAV, participants in the DRIP will be treated as having received a distribution of $10.00 for each $9.50 per Class A Share and/or $8.88 per Class T Share reinvested by them under the DRIP. Our stockholders will be taxed on the amount of such distribution (including the discount from fair market value) as a dividend to the extent such distribution is from current or accumulated earnings and profits, unless we have designated all or a portion of the dividend as a capital gain dividend. Tax information regarding each participant's participation in the DRIP will be provided to each participant at least annually.\nAmendment, Suspension and Termination\nWe reserve the right to amend any aspect of, suspend, or terminate the DRIP for any reason at any time upon ten days' written notice to participants. The reinvestment agent also reserves the right to terminate a participant's individual participation in the DRIP (without terminating the DRIP generally), by sending ten days' prior written notice of termination to the terminated participant. Notices to a DRIP participant may be given by letter addressed to the participant at the participant's last address of record with the reinvestment agent or by providing the relevant information in a press release or a report filed by the company with the SEC.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with the Advisor and its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, the Advisor or its affiliates for acquisition and advisory fees and expenses, organization and offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution fees, reimbursement of certain operating costs, and possibly disposition fees. Refer to Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. It is at least reasonably possible that these estimates could change in the near term. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that will require our management to exercise their business judgment or make significant estimates:\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of the OP. The financial statements of the OP are prepared using accounting policies consistent with our policies. All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nReal Estate Investments\nUpon acquisition, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 805, Business Combinations, the purchase price of a property is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets. The purchase price allocation is based on management's estimate of the property's as-if\u201d vacant fair value. The as-if\u201d vacant fair value is calculated by using all available information such as the replacement cost of such asset, appraisals, property condition reports, market data and other related information. The allocation of the purchase price to intangible lease assets represents the value associated with the in-place leases, which may include lost rent, leasing commissions, legal and other related costs.\nIf any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value and the face value of the debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt assumed. Costs associated with the acquisition of a property, including acquisition fees paid, are expensed as incurred.\nReal estate assets, including land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and intangible lease assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs associated with the development and improvement of the Company's real estate assets are capitalized as incurred, Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred. Real estate-related depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as described in the following table:\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> Land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Not depreciated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Buildings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Furniture, fixtures, and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intangible lease assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6 months\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment\nReal estate assets that are determined to be held and used will be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, and the Company will evaluate the recoverability of such real estate asset based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such real estate asset, and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the real estate asset. If impaired, the real estate asset will be written down to its estimated fair value.\nFair Value Measures and Financial Instruments\nFrom time to time, the Company records certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Real estate assets may be stated at fair value if they become impaired in a given period and may be stated at fair value if they are held for sale and the fair value of such assets is below historical cost. Additionally, the Company will record derivative financial instruments at fair value. The Company also uses fair value metrics to evaluate the carrying values of its real estate assets and for the disclosure of certain financial instruments.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 3 inputs are the unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumption, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on input from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company will utilize an independent third party to perform the allocation of value analysis for each property acquisition and also to perform the market valuations on interest rate caps and has established policies, as described above, processes and procedures intended to ensure that the valuation methodologies for investments and interest rate caps are fair and consistent as of the measurement date.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's primary operations will consist of rental income earned from its tenants under lease agreements with terms of one year or less. Rental income is recognized when earned. This policy effectively results in rental income recognition on the straight-line method over the related terms of the leases. Resident reimbursements and other income consist of charges billed to tenants for utilities, carport and garage rental, pets, administrative, application and other fees and are recognized when earned.\nOrganization and Offering Expenses\nOrganization and offering expenses include all expenses (other than selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and the distribution fee) to be paid by us in connection with the Offering. Organization and offering expenses include, but are not limited to: (i) legal, accounting, printing, mailing and filing fees; (ii) charges of our escrow agent; and (iii) due diligence expense reimbursements to participating broker-dealers.\nOrganization expenses will be expensed to us as incurred at the time that the Minimum Offering Requirement is achieved. Offering costs incurred by the Advisor and its affiliates on our behalf prior to that time are deferred and will be paid from the proceeds of the Offering. These costs will be treated as a reduction of the total proceeds. We will reimburse the Advisor and its affiliates for organization and offering expenses it incurs on our behalf, but only to the extent the reimbursement would not exceed 1.0% of the gross offering proceeds.\nAcquisition Costs\nAcquisition costs include costs incurred to acquire properties. The amount of acquisition costs incurred depends on the specific circumstances of each closing and are one-time costs associated with each acquisition. We may pay the Advisor an acquisition fee equal to 1.0% of the purchase price of each asset acquired, excluding any acquisition expenses.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company amortizes the fair value of stock-based compensation awards to expense over the vesting period and records any dividend equivalents earned as dividends for financial reporting purposes. Stock-based compensation awards are valued at the fair value on the date of grant and amortized as an expense over the vesting period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have elected to opt out\u201d of such extended transition period. Therefore, we intend to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the applicable dates on which the adoption of standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of such extended transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topics 205 and 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08\u201d). The updated guidance revised the definition of a discontinued operation by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity are classified as held for sale or disposed of by sale or by means other than a sale, such as an abandonment. Examples of a strategic shift could include a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment, or other major parts of an entity. In addition, ASU 2014-08 requires expanded disclosures for discontinued operations so users of the financial statements will be provided with more information about the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of discontinued operations. The Company implemented the provisions of ASU 2014-08 as of January 1, 2015.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018. The Company has not yet determined the impact of the new standard on its current policies for revenue recognition.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU No. 2014-15\u201d), which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption being permitted. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-15 as of January 1, 2017, and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01\u201d). The amendments in ASU No. 2015-01 eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Although the amendment will eliminate the requirements for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-01 as of January 1, 2016, and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. ASU 2015-02 also significantly changes how to evaluate voting rights for entities that are not similar to limited partnerships when determining whether the entity is a VIE, which may affect entities for which the decision making rights are conveyed through a contractual arrangement. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-02 as of January 1, 2016. The Company has not yet determined the impact of the new standard on its current policies for consolidation.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest ( ASU No. 2015-03\u201d), which changes the way reporting enterprises record debt issuance costs. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements ( ASU No. 2015-15\u201d). ASU 2015-15 supplements the requirements of ASU 2015-03 by allowing an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs related to a line of credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of January 1, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standards to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which changes certain recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU requires all equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or resulting in consolidation, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, amends the presentation requirements for changes in the fair value of financial liabilities, requires presentation of financial instruments by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nInflation\nConsistent with the multifamily property focus, we anticipate that the leases we enter into for multifamily apartment homes will be for a term of one year or less. These terms provide us with maximum flexibility to implement rental increases when the market will bear such increases and may provide us with a hedge against inflation.\nREIT Tax Election\nWe intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under the Code and intend to operate as such beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nValuation Guidelines; Calculation of NAV\nUntil April 11, 2016, the date that the amendments to FINRA Rule 2340 take effect (or earlier if the Board determines it is in our best interest), we expect to use $10.00 and $9.35 as the estimated NAV per Class A share and Class T share, respectively. Following such date, if we have not yet disclosed an estimated NAV per share, then our stockholders' customer account statements will include a value per share that is equal to the public offering price less all up-front underwriting compensation and certain organization and offering expenses. If we provide an estimated NAV prior to the conclusion of the Offering, the Board may determine to modify the public offering price, including the price at which shares are offered through our DRIP, to reflect the estimated per share NAV. We are not required to provide an estimated NAV based on the value of our assets until a date no later than 150 days following the second anniversary of the date we break escrow in the Offering. Prior to providing an estimated NAV based on a valuation of our assets, the per share values that we report will not reflect the proceeds our stockholders would receive upon liquidation or upon the sale of their shares. Furthermore, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us, or any liquidating distribution of our assets, then such assets, or the proceeds therefrom, will be distributed between the holders of Class A shares and Class T shares ratably in proportion to the respective NAV for each class until the NAV for each class has been paid. The NAV will be calculated on a company-wide basis, with any adjustments to Class A or Class T shares made subsequent to such company-wide calculation. For purposes of calculating NAV, we intend to use the most recent price paid to acquire the applicable class of shares in the primary Offering (ignoring purchase price discounts for certain categories of purchasers) as the estimated per share value of our shares until the Board determines our NAV. Each holder of shares of a particular class of common stock will be entitled to receive, ratably with each other holder of shares of such class, that portion of such aggregate assets available for distribution as the number of outstanding shares of such class held by such holder bears to the total number of outstanding shares of such class then outstanding. If we provide an estimated NAV prior to the conclusion of the Offering, the Board may determine to modify the public offering price to reflect the estimated per share NAV.\nPrior to 150 days following the second anniversary of the date we break escrow in the Offering (or earlier if the Board so directs or applicable regulations require), we are required to provide an initial estimated NAV per share of each class of our common stock based on the value of our assets. We will provide an update of the initial estimated NAV as of the end of each completed fiscal quarter (or fiscal year, in the case of a quarter ending at a fiscal year-end) thereafter. Once we are required to provide an estimated NAV per share, our NAV will be determined by the Board based on the input of the Advisor, our audit committee and, if engaged by the Board, one or more independent valuation firms. We intend to base our calculation of estimated NAV on the values of our assets and liabilities, without ascribing additional value to our enterprise or the going concern of our business. We expect that the values of our assets and liabilities will reflect the specific terms of our investments and our indebtedness, as well as conditions prevailing in the real estate, credit and broader financial markets. In addition, on a quarterly basis, management will update our NAV to reflect changes in the fair value of our indebtedness, estimated property disposition costs (including estimates of fees payable to the Advisor), and our other net assets and liabilities. In general, we expect to report our quarterly estimated NAV in filings with the SEC and on our website.\nSubsequent Events\nStatus of Our Offering\nAs of March 25, 2016, we had sold approximately 217,391 shares of Class A common stock in our initial public offering for gross proceeds of $2.0 million, or $9.20 per share, reflecting the fact that selling commissions and dealer manager fees were not paid in connection with the sale. On March 24, 2016, we released $2.0 million that was held in escrow, thus satisfying the Minimum Offering Requirement to break escrow and allow us to commence material operations.\nIssuance of Restricted Stock to Our Independent Directors\nPursuant to our restricted share plan, upon the initial release from escrow of $2.0 million, each of our two independent directors, John Pons and D. Kirk McAllaster, Jr., received a grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Class A common stock. The shares of restricted Class A common stock vest in equal amounts annually over a four-year period following the first anniversary of the date of grant in increments of 25% per annum.\nAmendment to Escrow Agreement\nOn January 20, 2016, upon unanimous approval of the Board, including its independent directors, the Company amended the escrow agreement with the Dealer Manager and UMB Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the Escrow Agent\u201d), which reduced the Minimum Offering Requirement from $10.0 million to $2.0 million in gross offering proceeds prior to the release to us by the Escrow Agent. The proceeds from residents of the State of Pennsylvania and the State of Washington will remain in the escrow account until total subscriptions (including amounts previously disbursed to us and the amounts then held in the escrow account) equal or exceed $50 million and $20 million, respectively.\nAmendment to Dealer Manager Agreement\nOn March 23, 2016, upon unanimous approval of the Board, including its independent directors, the Company amended the Dealer Manager Agreement with the Dealer Manager which reduced dealer manager fees on Class A and Class T common shares from 3.0% to 1.0% and reduced the reimbursement to our Advisor of organization and offering expenses from 1.5% to 1.0% of gross offering proceeds.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report. As used herein, the terms we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to NexPoint Multifamily Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, NexPoint Multifamily Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as the OP,\u201d and to their subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe were formed on November 12, 2013 as a Maryland corporation that intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our Offering to directly or indirectly acquire, own, operate and selectively develop well-located core-plus multifamily properties with a modest value-add component, in large cities and suburban markets of large cities, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. We consider core-plus\u201d multifamily properties to be properties we believe are high quality, yet ones which we also believe possess the ability to increase in value through some event. Examples include properties that have scheduled vacancies or leases rolling over or that would benefit from modest upgrades or renovations that would allow us to increase rents. We expect the size of individual properties that we purchase to vary significantly, but we expect that most of the properties we acquire will have a purchase price between $20 million and $30 million. Our modest value-add component will consist, on average, of investing $1,000 - $4,000 per unit in the first 24 months of ownership, in an effort to add value to the asset's exterior and interior. Our modest value-add program will be implemented at the direction and supervision of our Advisor. In addition, we anticipate incurring average annual capital expenditures of $175,000 to $275,000 per multifamily property in connection with the ongoing operations of our business. Although we will monitor the adequacy of this average, we believe these figures to be sufficient to maintain the properties at a high level in the markets in which we operate. In most cases, we plan to escrow equity at the time we acquire an asset to fund these planned capital expenditures and value-add improvements.\nWe may also directly or indirectly acquire, on an opportunistic basis, core multifamily properties, although we do not expect this to be a substantial portion of our portfolio. We consider core multifamily properties to be properties that we believe are of the highest quality in historically strong markets that are easy to finance and generally do not require upgrades or renovations. We may also seek to invest in multifamily housing debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity in situations where the risk/return correlation is more attractive than investments in common equity. This strategy would be designed to minimize potential losses during market downturns and maximize risk adjusted total returns to our stockholders in all market cycles.\nOn August 12, 2015, the SEC declared effective our Registration Statement to offer a maximum of up to $1.0 billion in shares of common stock in our primary offering and up to $100 million in shares pursuant to our DRIP. We are publicly offering two classes of shares of common stock, Class A shares and Class T shares, in any combination up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different selling commissions, and there will be an ongoing distribution fee with respect to the primary offering of Class T shares. The initial offering price for the shares in the primary offering is $10.00 per Class A share and $9.35 per Class T share. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between our primary offering and our DRIP. We are also offering up to $100 million in shares of common stock pursuant to our DRIP at an initial price of $9.50 per Class A share and $8.88 per Class T share, which is 95% of the primary offering price.\nSubject to certain restrictions and limitations, the Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets. The Advisor and its personnel have no obligation to, but may present us with investment opportunities with a purchase price of less than $10.0 million. The Advisor's investment committee may purchase on our account, without specific prior approval of the Board, properties with a purchase price of $15.0 million or less, so long as the investment in the property would not, if consummated, violate our investment guidelines or any restrictions on indebtedness and the consideration to be paid for such properties does not exceed the fair market value of such properties. Any investment with a purchase price greater than $15.0 million or that, if consummated, would violate our investment guidelines or any restrictions on indebtedness, requires the approval of the Board.\nPursuant to the terms of our Offering, offering proceeds were held in an escrow account until we met the minimum offering amount of $2.0 million. On March 24, 2016, we raised the minimum offering amount and the Offering proceeds held in escrow were released to us. As of March 25, 2016, we had sold approximately 217,391 shares of Class A common stock in our Offering for gross proceeds of $2.0 million, or $9.20 per share, reflecting the fact that selling commissions and dealer manager fees were not paid in connection with the sale. As of December 31, 2015, we had sold 22,223 shares of our common stock to the Advisor for an aggregate purchase price of $200,000, or $9.00 per share, reflecting the fact that selling commissions and dealer manager fees were not paid in connection with the sale. These shares were subsequently renamed as shares of Class A common stock. The Advisor or any affiliate may not sell these shares while the Sponsor remains our sponsor but it may transfer the shares to other affiliates. We will offer shares of our common stock on a continuous basis until August 12, 2017, unless extended. However, in certain states the Offering may continue for only one year unless we renew the offering period for an additional year. We reserve the right to terminate our Offering at any time.\nSubstantially all of our assets will be held by the OP. We are the sole general partner and a limited partner of the OP. The special limited partner of the OP is the Advisor.\nAs we accept subscriptions for shares, we will transfer substantially all of the net proceeds of the Offering to the OP as a capital contribution, however, we will be deemed to have made capital contributions in the amount of the gross offering proceeds received from investors. The OP will be deemed to have simultaneously paid the costs associated with the Offering. If the OP requires additional funds at any time in excess of capital contributions made by us or from borrowing, we will borrow funds from a financial institution or other lender and lend such funds to the OP on the same terms and conditions as would be applicable to our borrowing of such funds. The limited partnership agreement of the OP provides that the OP will be operated in a manner that will enable us to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that the OP will not be classified as a publicly traded partnership\u201d for purposes of Section 7704 of the Code, which classification could result in the OP being taxed as a corporation. We will experience a relative increase in liquidity as additional subscriptions for shares of our common stock are received and a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate our assets.\nWe intend to make an election under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. If we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and may not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our qualification is denied unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our after-tax net income.\nWe will monitor the various qualification tests that we must meet to maintain our status as a REIT. Ownership of our shares will be monitored to ensure that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time after the first taxable year for which we make an election to be taxed as a REIT. We will also determine, on a quarterly basis, that the gross income, asset and distribution tests are met.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have not acquired any real estate investments or commenced material operations. However, as of March 24, 2016, we have accepted contributions of $2.2 million, broken escrow and have commenced material operations. Because we have not acquired any assets, we are not aware of any known trends or uncertainties material to our proposed operations, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, which may reasonably be anticipated to have a material impact on the capital resources and the revenue to be derived from the operation of our future assets.\nThe expenses incurred to date are primarily related to corporate general and administrative expenses, such as Board fees, directors and officers liability insurance and audit fees, that our Advisor has incurred on our behalf. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and for the period from November 12, 2013 (inception) to December 31, 2013, are not indicative of those expected in future periods. As we raise capital, we will make acquisitions of real estate and increase our borrowings, which will have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, or FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably overtime, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or is requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Additionally, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time. An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indicators exist and if the carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.\nHistorical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. However, FFO and MFFO, as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses. Our management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases. The Board, in consultation with our management, may determine that it is in our best interests to begin the process of considering alternatives with respect to a liquidity event (i.e., listing of its common stock on a national exchange, a merger or sale of us or another similar transaction) at such time during our offering stage as the Board can reasonably determine that all of the securities in the Offering will be sold within a reasonable time period (i.e. three to six months). Thus, we will not continuously purchase assets and will have a limited life.\nDue to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after the Offering has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after the Offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after the Offering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.\nOur MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition-related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses are paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which properties are acquired and will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired. MFFO that excludes such costs and expenses would only be comparable to non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activities and have similar operating characteristics as us. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. We view both gains and losses from dispositions of assets and fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance and calculating MFFO. While we are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of on-going operations. As disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report, the purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with those processes, are key operational features of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to investors. Acquisition fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by the Advisor if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares in the Offering, and therefore such fees and expenses may need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows.\nOur management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors. For example, acquisition costs are funded from the proceeds of the Offering and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.\nPresentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of its liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund its cash needs including its ability to make distributions to its stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in\nan offering such as the Offering (unless and until we calculate NAV prior to the close of the Offering) where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value and there is no NAV determination during the offering stage and for a period thereafter. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed. FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining FFO or MFFO. Since we had not begun operations as of the date of this Annual Report, we have not included a calculation of FFO or MFFO.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal demands for funds will be for property and real estate debt acquisitions, either directly or through investment interests, for the payment of operating expenses and distributions, and for the payment of interest on any outstanding indebtedness. Generally, cash needs for items other than property acquisitions will be met from operations, and cash needs for property acquisitions will be funded by our public offering of shares and debt. However, there may be a delay between the sale of our shares and our purchase of properties, which could result in a delay in the benefits to our stockholders, if any, of returns generated from our investment operations. As a result, we may increase leverage above our targeted level on a temporary basis in order to make current investments and then use proceeds from fundraising to lower the leverage. Over time, as we become established and the fundraising effort begins to scale, we do not expect our target leverage ratio to exceed 50% to 60% of the cost of our properties.\nThe Advisor will evaluate potential property acquisitions and engage in negotiations with sellers and lenders on our behalf. After a purchase contract is executed that contains specific terms, the property will not be purchased until the successful completion of due diligence, which includes review of the title insurance commitment, an appraisal and an environmental analysis. In some instances, the proposed acquisition will require the negotiation of final binding agreements, which may include financing documents. During this period, we may decide to temporarily invest any unused proceeds from the Offering in certain investments that could yield lower returns than properties we intend to acquire. These lower returns may affect our ability to make distributions.\nPotential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed modified funds from operations, or MFFO, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in case of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. We have not identified any sources of such financing.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe have not yet commenced material operations.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nOur cash used in investing activities will vary based on how quickly we raise funds in the Offering and how quickly we invest those funds towards acquisitions of real estate. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and for the period from November 12, 2013 (inception) to December 31, 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $0.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the Offering, net of distributions paid to our stockholders and the issuance of notes payable. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $0. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $199,900, which primarily related to a sale of 22,223 shares of our Class A common stock to our Advisor. During the period from November 12, 2013 (inception) to December 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $100, which related to our initial capitalization by an affiliate of our Advisor.\nObligations and Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding obligations or commitments that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIncome Taxes\nWe intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under the Code and intend to operate as such beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nDistributions\nThere were no distributions declared or paid during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWhen we have sufficient cash flow available to pay distributions, we intend to pay monthly distributions to our stockholders. As of the date of this Annual Report, we had no real estate investments. We will not make any real estate investments until we identify investment opportunities and raise sufficient capital pursuant to the Offering to do so. We cannot predict when we will begin to generate sufficient cash flow from these investments to pay distributions as a result of such investments. Because all of our operations will be performed indirectly through the OP, our ability to pay distributions depends on the OP's ability to pay distributions to its partners, including to us. If we do not have enough cash from operations to fund the distributions, we may borrow, issue additional securities or sell assets in order to fund the distributions or make the distributions out of net proceeds from the Offering. We have not established any limit on the amount of proceeds from the Offering that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus, unless our charter provides otherwise, senior liquidation preferences, if any.\nIn addition, the fees, distributions and reimbursements payable to the Advisor depend on various factors, including the assets we acquire, indebtedness incurred, and sales prices of investments sold, and therefore cannot be quantified or reserved for until such fees have been earned. We are required to pay these amounts to the Advisor regardless of the amount of cash we distribute to our stockholders and therefore our ability to make distributions from cash flow, as well as cash flow available for investment, to our stockholders may be negatively impacted.\nDistributions will be paid to our stockholders when and if authorized by the Board and declared by us out of legally available funds. We expect to declare and pay distributions on a monthly basis as of daily record dates. Distributions will be authorized at the discretion of the Board, which will be influenced in part by its intention to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code. We intend to make distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirement and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings; however, it may not always be possible to do so. Each distribution will be accompanied by a notice which sets forth: (a) the record date; (b) the amount per share that will be distributed; (c) the equivalent annualized yield; (d) the amount and percentage of the distributions paid from operations, offering proceeds and other sources; and (e) for those investors participating in the DRIP, a statement that a distribution statement will be provided in lieu of a check. The funds we receive from operations that are available for distribution may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:\n \u00b7 the amount of time required for us to invest the funds received in the Offering; \n \u00b7 our operating and interest expenses; \n \u00b7 operating results of our properties; \n \u00b7 the amount of distributions or dividends received by us from our indirect real estate investments; \n \u00b7 our ability to keep our properties occupied; \n \u00b7 our ability to maintain or increase rental rates when renewing or replacing current leases; \n \u00b7 capital expenditures and reserves for such expenditures; \n \u00b7 the issuance of additional shares; and \n \u00b7 financings and refinancings. \nWe must annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, in order to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code. The Board may authorize distributions in excess of this percentage as it deems appropriate. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year, distributions may not reflect our income earned in that particular distribution period, but may be made in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period and may be made in advance of actual receipt of funds in an attempt to make distributions relatively uniform. To allow for such differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses, and the effect of required debt payments, among other things, we could be required to borrow funds from third parties on a short-term basis, issue new securities, or sell assets to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. These methods of obtaining funding could affect future distributions by increasing operating costs and decreasing available cash. In addition, such distributions may constitute a return of capital.\nDistributions in kind will not be permitted, except for:\n \u00b7 distributions of readily marketable securities; \n \u00b7 distributions of beneficial interests in a liquidating trust established for our dissolution and the liquidation of our assets in accordance with the terms of our charter; or \n \u00b7 distributions of in-kind property, so long as, with respect to such in-kind property, the Board advises each stockholder of the risks associated with direct ownership of the property, offers each stockholder the election of receiving in-kind property distributions, and distributes in- kind property only to those stockholders who accept the directors' offer. \nShare Repurchase Program\nOur share repurchase program, as described below, may provide eligible stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell shares back to us, subject to restrictions and applicable law, if such repurchases do not impair our capital or operations. Specifically, state securities regulators impose investor suitability standards that establish specific financial thresholds that must be met by any investor in certain illiquid, long-term investments, including REIT shares.\nUntil the NAV pricing date, except with respect to repurchases sought within one year of a stockholder's death or Qualifying Disability (as determined by the applicable governmental agency), common stockholders must hold their shares for at least one year in order to participate in our share repurchase program.\nPrior to the time the Advisor begins calculating NAV, the price per share that we will pay to repurchase shares of our common stock will be as follows:\n \u00b7 for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least one year, the price will be the lower of $9.25 and 92.5% of the amount paid for each such share; \n \u00b7 for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least two years, the price will be the lower of $9.50 and 95.0% of the amount paid for each such share; \n \u00b7 for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least three years, the price will be the lower of $9.75 and 97.5% of the amount paid for each such share; \n \u00b7 for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least four years, the price will be the lower of $10.00 and 100% of the amount paid for each such share; \nin each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of our share repurchase program, we intend to make repurchases, if requested, at least once quarterly. Each stockholder whose repurchase request is granted will receive the repurchase amount within 30 days after the fiscal quarter in which we grant the repurchase request. Subject to the limitations described in the prospectus, we also will repurchase shares upon the request of the estate, heir or beneficiary, as applicable, of a deceased stockholder. We will limit the number of shares repurchased pursuant to our share repurchase program in any calendar year to 5% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year. In addition, funds available for our share repurchase program are limited or described below and may not be sufficient to accommodate all requests. Due to these limitations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.\nFunding for the share repurchase program will be derived from proceeds we maintain from the sale of shares under the DRIP and other operating funds, if any, as our Board, in its sole discretion, may reserve for this purpose. We cannot guarantee that the funds set aside for the share repurchase program will be sufficient to accommodate all requests made each year. However, a stockholder may withdraw its request at any time or ask that we honor the request when funds are available. Pending repurchase requests will be honored on a pro rata basis.\nWhether the Advisor has begun NAV calculations or not, the share repurchase program will terminate immediately if our shares are listed on any national securities exchange. In addition, the Board may amend, suspend (in whole or in part) or terminate the share repurchase program at any time upon 30 days' notice. Further, the Board reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any requests for repurchases.\nDistribution Reinvestment Plan\nWe have adopted the DRIP. The following is a summary of the DRIP.\nInvestment of Distributions\nWe have adopted a DRIP pursuant to which our stockholders may elect to purchase shares of our common stock with our distributions. Distributions on Class A shares will be reinvested in Class A shares and distributions on Class T shares will be reinvested in Class T shares. We have the discretion to extend the offering period for the shares being offered under the DRIP beyond the termination of our primary offering until we have sold all the shares allocated to the DRIP. We also may offer shares under the DRIP pursuant to a new registration statement. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between our primary offering and the DRIP. Any shares issued pursuant to the DRIP are subject to registration and renewal in any state in which such shares are offered and the offering of such shares is not exempt under applicable laws and regulations. Until the NAV pricing date, we will offer shares under our DRIP at $9.50 per Class A Share and $8.88 per Class T Share, which is 95% of the primary offering price. Thereafter, we will offer shares under our DRIP at per share NAV.\nNo dealer manager fees or selling commissions or, with respect to Class T shares, distribution fees, will be paid with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the DRIP; therefore, we will retain all of the proceeds from the reinvestment of distributions.\nPursuant to the terms of the DRIP, the reinvestment agent, which currently is us, will act on behalf of participants to reinvest the cash distributions they receive from us. Stockholders participating in the DRIP may purchase fractional shares. If sufficient shares are not available for issuance under the DRIP, the reinvestment agent will remit excess cash distributions to the participants. Participants purchasing shares pursuant to the DRIP will have the same rights as stockholders with respect to shares purchased under the DRIP and will be treated in the same manner as if such shares were issued pursuant to the primary offering.\nElection to Participate or Terminate Participation\nA stockholder may become a participant in the DRIP by making a written election to participate on his or her subscription agreement at the time he or she subscribes for shares. Any stockholder who has not previously elected to participate in the DRIP may so elect at any time by delivering to the reinvestment agent a completed enrollment form or other written authorization required by the reinvestment agent. Participation in the DRIP will commence with the next distribution payable after receipt of the participant's notice, provided it is received at least ten days prior to the last day of the fiscal quarter, month or other period to which the distribution relates.\nSome brokers may determine not to offer their clients the opportunity to participate in the DRIP. Any prospective investor who wishes to participate in the DRIP should consult with his or her broker as to the broker's position regarding participation in the DRIP.\nWe reserve the right to prohibit qualified retirement plans and other benefit plan investors\u201d (as defined in ERISA) from participating in the DRIP if such participation would cause our underlying assets to constitute plan assets\u201d of qualified retirement plans. A material change shall include any anticipated or actual decrease in net worth or annual gross income or any other change in circumstances that would cause the stockholder to fail to meet the suitability standards set forth in our prospectus for the stockholder's initial purchase of shares of common stock.\nEach stockholder electing to participate in the DRIP shall notify the reinvestment agent if any time during his or her participation in the DRIP, there is any material change in the stockholder's financial condition or inaccuracy of any representation under the subscription agreement for such stockholder's initial purchase of our shares.\nSubscribers should note that affirmative action in the form of written notice to the reinvestment agent must be taken to withdraw from participation in the DRIP. A withdrawal from participation in the DRIP will be effective with respect to distributions for a distribution period only if written notice of termination is received at least ten days prior to the end of such distribution period. In addition, a transfer of shares prior to the date our shares are listed for trading on a national securities exchange, which we have no intent to do at this time and which may never occur, will terminate participation in the DRIP with respect to such transferred shares as of the first day of the distribution period in which the transfer is effective, unless the transferee demonstrates to the reinvestment agent that the transferee meets the requirements for participation in the plan and affirmatively elects to participate in the DRIP by providing to the reinvestment agent an executed enrollment form or other written authorization required by the reinvestment agent.\nOffers and sales of shares pursuant to the DRIP must be registered in every state in which such offers and sales are made and the offering of such shares is not exempt under applicable laws and regulations. Generally, such registrations are for a period of one year. Thus, we may have to stop selling shares pursuant to the DRIP in any states in which our registration is not renewed or extended.\nReports to Participants\nWithin 90 days after the end of each calendar year, the reinvestment agent will mail to each participant a statement of account describing, as to such participant, the distributions received, the number of shares purchased, the purchase price for such shares and the total shares purchased on behalf of the participant during the prior year pursuant to the DRIP.\nExcluded Distributions\nThe Board may designate that certain cash or other distributions attributable to net sales proceeds will be excluded from distributions that may be reinvested in shares under the DRIP, or Excluded Distributions. Accordingly, if proceeds attributable to the potential sale transaction described above are distributed to stockholders as an Excluded Distribution, such amounts may not be reinvested in our shares pursuant to the DRIP. The determination of whether all or part of a distribution will be deemed to be an Excluded Distribution is separate and unrelated to our requirement to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income. In its initial determination of whether to make a distribution and the amount of the distribution, the Board will consider, among other factors, our cash position and our distribution requirements as a REIT. Once the Board determines to make the distribution, it will then consider whether all or part of the distribution will be deemed to be an Excluded Distribution. In most instances, we expect that the Board would not deem any of the distribution an Excluded Distribution. In that event, the amount distributed to participants in the DRIP will be reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. If all or a portion of the distribution is deemed an Excluded Distribution, the distribution will be made to all stockholders, however, the excluded portion will not be reinvested. As a result, we would not be able to use any of the Excluded Distribution to assist in meeting future distributions and the stockholders would not be able to use the distribution to purchase additional shares of our common stock through the DRIP. We currently do not have any planned Excluded Distributions, which will only be made, if at all, in addition to, not in lieu of, regular distributions.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nTaxable participants will incur tax liability even though they have elected not to receive their distributions in cash but rather to have their distributions reinvested under the DRIP. In addition, to the extent our stockholders purchase shares through the DRIP at a discount to their fair market value, they will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving an additional distribution equal to the amount of the discount. Until such time as we calculate NAV, we will sell shares pursuant to the DRIP at $9.50 per Class A Share and $8.88 per Class T Share, which is 95% of the primary offering price, and expect the Board to estimate the fair value of a share of our common stock to be $10.00, the offering price in the primary offering. Additionally, at least until our offering stage is complete, we expect that no secondary trading market for our shares will develop. Therefore, at least until we calculate NAV, participants in the DRIP will be treated as having received a distribution of $10.00 for each $9.50 per Class A Share and/or $8.88 per Class T Share reinvested by them under the DRIP. Our stockholders will be taxed on the amount of such distribution (including the discount from fair market value) as a dividend to the extent such distribution is from current or accumulated earnings and profits, unless we have designated all or a portion of the dividend as a capital gain dividend. Tax information regarding each participant's participation in the DRIP will be provided to each participant at least annually.\nAmendment, Suspension and Termination\nWe reserve the right to amend any aspect of, suspend, or terminate the DRIP for any reason at any time upon ten days' written notice to participants. The reinvestment agent also reserves the right to terminate a participant's individual participation in the DRIP (without terminating the DRIP generally), by sending ten days' prior written notice of termination to the terminated participant. Notices to a DRIP participant may be given by letter addressed to the participant at the participant's last address of record with the reinvestment agent or by providing the relevant information in a press release or a report filed by the company with the SEC.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with the Advisor and its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, the Advisor or its affiliates for acquisition and advisory fees and expenses, organization and offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution fees, reimbursement of certain operating costs, and possibly disposition fees. Refer to Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. It is at least reasonably possible that these estimates could change in the near term. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that will require our management to exercise their business judgment or make significant estimates:\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of the OP. The financial statements of the OP are prepared using accounting policies consistent with our policies. All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nReal Estate Investments\nUpon acquisition, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 805, Business Combinations, the purchase price of a property is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets. The purchase price allocation is based on management's estimate of the property's as-if\u201d vacant fair value. The as-if\u201d vacant fair value is calculated by using all available information such as the replacement cost of such asset, appraisals, property condition reports, market data and other related information. The allocation of the purchase price to intangible lease assets represents the value associated with the in-place leases, which may include lost rent, leasing commissions, legal and other related costs.\nIf any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value and the face value of the debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt assumed. Costs associated with the acquisition of a property, including acquisition fees paid, are expensed as incurred.\nReal estate assets, including land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and intangible lease assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs associated with the development and improvement of the Company's real estate assets are capitalized as incurred, Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred. Real estate-related depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as described in the following table:\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> Land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Not depreciated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Buildings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Furniture, fixtures, and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intangible lease assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6 months\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment\nReal estate assets that are determined to be held and used will be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, and the Company will evaluate the recoverability of such real estate asset based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such real estate asset, and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the real estate asset. If impaired, the real estate asset will be written down to its estimated fair value.\nFair Value Measures and Financial Instruments\nFrom time to time, the Company records certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Real estate assets may be stated at fair value if they become impaired in a given period and may be stated at fair value if they are held for sale and the fair value of such assets is below historical cost. Additionally, the Company will record derivative financial instruments at fair value. The Company also uses fair value metrics to evaluate the carrying values of its real estate assets and for the disclosure of certain financial instruments.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\n \u00b7 Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. \n \u00b7 Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. \n \u00b7 Level 3 inputs are the unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumption, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on input from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. \nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company will utilize an independent third party to perform the allocation of value analysis for each property acquisition and also to perform the market valuations on interest rate caps and has established policies, as described above, processes and procedures intended to ensure that the valuation methodologies for investments and interest rate caps are fair and consistent as of the measurement date.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's primary operations will consist of rental income earned from its tenants under lease agreements with terms of one year or less. Rental income is recognized when earned. This policy effectively results in rental income recognition on the straight-line method over the related terms of the leases. Resident reimbursements and other income consist of charges billed to tenants for utilities, carport and garage rental, pets, administrative, application and other fees and are recognized when earned.\nOrganization and Offering Expenses\nOrganization and offering expenses include all expenses (other than selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and the distribution fee) to be paid by us in connection with the Offering. Organization and offering expenses include, but are not limited to: (i) legal, accounting, printing, mailing and filing fees; (ii) charges of our escrow agent; and (iii) due diligence expense reimbursements to participating broker-dealers.\nOrganization expenses will be expensed to us as incurred at the time that the Minimum Offering Requirement is achieved. Offering costs incurred by the Advisor and its affiliates on our behalf prior to that time are deferred and will be paid from the proceeds of the Offering. These costs will be treated as a reduction of the total proceeds. We will reimburse the Advisor and its affiliates for organization and offering expenses it incurs on our behalf, but only to the extent the reimbursement would not exceed 1.0% of the gross offering proceeds.\nAcquisition Costs\nAcquisition costs include costs incurred to acquire properties. The amount of acquisition costs incurred depends on the specific circumstances of each closing and are one-time costs associated with each acquisition. We may pay the Advisor an acquisition fee equal to 1.0% of the purchase price of each asset acquired, excluding any acquisition expenses.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company amortizes the fair value of stock-based compensation awards to expense over the vesting period and records any dividend equivalents earned as dividends for financial reporting purposes. Stock-based compensation awards are valued at the fair value on the date of grant and amortized as an expense over the vesting period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have elected to opt out\u201d of such extended transition period. Therefore, we intend to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the applicable dates on which the adoption of standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of such extended transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topics 205 and 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08\u201d). The updated guidance revised the definition of a discontinued operation by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity are classified as held for sale or disposed of by sale or by means other than a sale, such as an abandonment. Examples of a strategic shift could include a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment, or other major parts of an entity. In addition, ASU 2014-08 requires expanded disclosures for discontinued operations so users of the financial statements will be provided with more information about the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of discontinued operations. The Company implemented the provisions of ASU 2014-08 as of January 1, 2015.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018. The Company has not yet determined the impact of the new standard on its current policies for revenue recognition.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU No. 2014-15\u201d), which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption being permitted. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-15 as of January 1, 2017, and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01\u201d). The amendments in ASU No. 2015-01 eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Although the amendment will eliminate the requirements for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-01 as of January 1, 2016, and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. ASU 2015-02 also significantly changes how to evaluate voting rights for entities that are not similar to limited partnerships when determining whether the entity is a VIE, which may affect entities for which the decision making rights are conveyed through a contractual arrangement. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-02 as of January 1, 2016. The Company has not yet determined the impact of the new standard on its current policies for consolidation.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest ( ASU No. 2015-03\u201d), which changes the way reporting enterprises record debt issuance costs. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements ( ASU No. 2015-15\u201d). ASU 2015-15 supplements the requirements of ASU 2015-03 by allowing an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs related to a line of credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of January 1, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standards to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which changes certain recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU requires all equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or resulting in consolidation, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, amends the presentation requirements for changes in the fair value of financial liabilities, requires presentation of financial instruments by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nInflation\nConsistent with the multifamily property focus, we anticipate that the leases we enter into for multifamily apartment homes will be for a term of one year or less. These terms provide us with maximum flexibility to implement rental increases when the market will bear such increases and may provide us with a hedge against inflation.\nREIT Tax Election\nWe intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under the Code and intend to operate as such beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nValuation Guidelines; Calculation of NAV\nUntil April 11, 2016, the date that the amendments to FINRA Rule 2340 take effect (or earlier if the Board determines it is in our best interest), we expect to use $10.00 and $9.35 as the estimated NAV per Class A share and Class T share, respectively. Following such date, if we have not yet disclosed an estimated NAV per share, then our stockholders' customer account statements will include a value per share that is equal to the public offering price less all up-front underwriting compensation and certain organization and offering expenses. If we provide an estimated NAV prior to the conclusion of the Offering, the Board may determine to modify the public offering price, including the price at which shares are offered through our DRIP, to reflect the estimated per share NAV. We are not required to provide an estimated NAV based on the value of our assets until a date no later than 150 days following the second anniversary of the date we break escrow in the Offering. Prior to providing an estimated NAV based on a valuation of our assets, the per share values that we report will not reflect the proceeds our stockholders would receive upon liquidation or upon the sale of their shares. Furthermore, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us, or any liquidating distribution of our assets, then such assets, or the proceeds therefrom, will be distributed between the holders of Class A shares and Class T shares ratably in proportion to the respective NAV for each class until the NAV for each class has been paid. The NAV will be calculated on a company-wide basis, with any adjustments to Class A or Class T shares made subsequent to such company-wide calculation. For purposes of calculating NAV, we intend to use the most recent price paid to acquire the applicable class of shares in the primary Offering (ignoring purchase price discounts for certain categories of purchasers) as the estimated per share value of our shares until the Board determines our NAV. Each holder of shares of a particular class of common stock will be entitled to receive, ratably with each other holder of shares of such class, that portion of such aggregate assets available for distribution as the number of outstanding shares of such class held by such holder bears to the total number of outstanding shares of such class then outstanding. If we provide an estimated NAV prior to the conclusion of the Offering, the Board may determine to modify the public offering price to reflect the estimated per share NAV.\nPrior to 150 days following the second anniversary of the date we break escrow in the Offering (or earlier if the Board so directs or applicable regulations require), we are required to provide an initial estimated NAV per share of each class of our common stock based on the value of our assets. We will provide an update of the initial estimated NAV as of the end of each completed fiscal quarter (or fiscal year, in the case of a quarter ending at a fiscal year-end) thereafter. Once we are required to provide an estimated NAV per share, our NAV will be determined by the Board based on the input of the Advisor, our audit committee and, if engaged by the Board, one or more independent valuation firms. We intend to base our calculation of estimated NAV on the values of our assets and liabilities, without ascribing additional value to our enterprise or the going concern of our business. We expect that the values of our assets and liabilities will reflect the specific terms of our investments and our indebtedness, as well as conditions prevailing in the real estate, credit and broader financial markets. In addition, on a quarterly basis, management will update our NAV to reflect changes in the fair value of our indebtedness, estimated property disposition costs (including estimates of fees payable to the Advisor), and our other net assets and liabilities. In general, we expect to report our quarterly estimated NAV in filings with the SEC and on our website.\nSubsequent Events\nStatus of Our Offering\nAs of March 25, 2016, we had sold approximately 217,391 shares of Class A common stock in our initial public offering for gross proceeds of $2.0 million, or $9.20 per share, reflecting the fact that selling commissions and dealer manager fees were not paid in connection with the sale. On March 24, 2016, we released $2.0 million that was held in escrow, thus satisfying the Minimum Offering Requirement to break escrow and allow us to commence material operations.\nIssuance of Restricted Stock to Our Independent Directors\nPursuant to our restricted share plan, upon the initial release from escrow of $2.0 million, each of our two independent directors, John Pons and D. Kirk McAllaster, Jr., received a grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Class A common stock. The shares of restricted Class A common stock vest in equal amounts annually over a four-year period following the first anniversary of the date of grant in increments of 25% per annum.\nAmendment to Escrow Agreement\nOn January 20, 2016, upon unanimous approval of the Board, including its independent directors, the Company amended the escrow agreement with the Dealer Manager and UMB Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the Escrow Agent\u201d), which reduced the Minimum Offering Requirement from $10.0 million to $2.0 million in gross offering proceeds prior to the release to us by the Escrow Agent. The proceeds from residents of the State of Pennsylvania and the State of Washington will remain in the escrow account until total subscriptions (including amounts previously disbursed to us and the amounts then held in the escrow account) equal or exceed $50 million and $20 million, respectively.\nAmendment to Dealer Manager Agreement\nOn March 23, 2016, upon unanimous approval of the Board, including its independent directors, the Company amended the Dealer Manager Agreement with the Dealer Manager which reduced dealer manager fees on Class A and Class T common shares from 3.0% to 1.0% and reduced the reimbursement to our Advisor of organization and offering expenses from 1.5% to 1.0% of gross offering proceeds.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report. As used herein, the terms we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to NexPoint Multifamily Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, NexPoint Multifamily Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as the OP,\u201d and to their subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe were formed on November 12, 2013 as a Maryland corporation that intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our Offering to directly or indirectly acquire, own, operate and selectively develop well-located core-plus multifamily properties with a modest value-add component, in large cities and suburban markets of large cities, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. We consider core-plus\u201d multifamily properties to be properties we believe are high quality, yet ones which we also believe possess the ability to increase in value through some event. Examples include properties that have scheduled vacancies or leases rolling over or that would benefit from modest upgrades or renovations that would allow us to increase rents. We expect the size of individual properties that we purchase to vary significantly, but we expect that most of the properties we acquire will have a purchase price between $20 million and $30 million. Our modest value-add component will consist, on average, of investing $1,000 - $4,000 per unit in the first 24 months of ownership, in an effort to add value to the asset's exterior and interior. Our modest value-add program will be implemented at the direction and supervision of our Advisor. In addition, we anticipate incurring average annual capital expenditures of $175,000 to $275,000 per multifamily property in connection with the ongoing operations of our business. Although we will monitor the adequacy of this average, we believe these figures to be sufficient to maintain the properties at a high level in the markets in which we operate. In most cases, we plan to escrow equity at the time we acquire an asset to fund these planned capital expenditures and value-add improvements.\nWe may also directly or indirectly acquire, on an opportunistic basis, core multifamily properties, although we do not expect this to be a substantial portion of our portfolio. We consider core multifamily properties to be properties that we believe are of the highest quality in historically strong markets that are easy to finance and generally do not require upgrades or renovations. We may also seek to invest in multifamily housing debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity in situations where the risk/return correlation is more attractive than investments in common equity. This strategy would be designed to minimize potential losses during market downturns and maximize risk adjusted total returns to our stockholders in all market cycles.\nOn August 12, 2015, the SEC declared effective our Registration Statement to offer a maximum of up to $1.0 billion in shares of common stock in our primary offering and up to $100 million in shares pursuant to our DRIP. We are publicly offering two classes of shares of common stock, Class A shares and Class T shares, in any combination up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different selling commissions, and there will be an ongoing distribution fee with respect to the primary offering of Class T shares. The initial offering price for the shares in the primary offering is $10.00 per Class A share and $9.35 per Class T share. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between our primary offering and our DRIP. We are also offering up to $100 million in shares of common stock pursuant to our DRIP at an initial price of $9.50 per Class A share and $8.88 per Class T share, which is 95% of the primary offering price.\nSubject to certain restrictions and limitations, the Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets. The Advisor and its personnel have no obligation to, but may present us with investment opportunities with a purchase price of less than $10.0 million. The Advisor's investment committee may purchase on our account, without specific prior approval of the Board, properties with a purchase price of $15.0 million or less, so long as the investment in the property would not, if consummated, violate our investment guidelines or any restrictions on indebtedness and the consideration to be paid for such properties does not exceed the fair market value of such properties. Any investment with a purchase price greater than $15.0 million or that, if consummated, would violate our investment guidelines or any restrictions on indebtedness, requires the approval of the Board.\nPursuant to the terms of our Offering, offering proceeds were held in an escrow account until we met the minimum offering amount of $2.0 million. On March 24, 2016, we raised the minimum offering amount and the Offering proceeds held in escrow were released to us. As of March 25, 2016, we had sold approximately 217,391 shares of Class A common stock in our Offering for gross proceeds of $2.0 million, or $9.20 per share, reflecting the fact that selling commissions and dealer manager fees were not paid in connection with the sale. As of December 31, 2015, we had sold 22,223 shares of our common stock to the Advisor for an aggregate purchase price of $200,000, or $9.00 per share, reflecting the fact that selling commissions and dealer manager fees were not paid in connection with the sale. These shares were subsequently renamed as shares of Class A common stock. The Advisor or any affiliate may not sell these shares while the Sponsor remains our sponsor but it may transfer the shares to other affiliates. We will offer shares of our common stock on a continuous basis until August 12, 2017, unless extended. However, in certain states the Offering may continue for only one year unless we renew the offering period for an additional year. We reserve the right to terminate our Offering at any time.\nSubstantially all of our assets will be held by the OP. We are the sole general partner and a limited partner of the OP. The special limited partner of the OP is the Advisor.\nAs we accept subscriptions for shares, we will transfer substantially all of the net proceeds of the Offering to the OP as a capital contribution, however, we will be deemed to have made capital contributions in the amount of the gross offering proceeds received from investors. The OP will be deemed to have simultaneously paid the costs associated with the Offering. If the OP requires additional funds at any time in excess of capital contributions made by us or from borrowing, we will borrow funds from a financial institution or other lender and lend such funds to the OP on the same terms and conditions as would be applicable to our borrowing of such funds. The limited partnership agreement of the OP provides that the OP will be operated in a manner that will enable us to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that the OP will not be classified as a publicly traded partnership\u201d for purposes of Section 7704 of the Code, which classification could result in the OP being taxed as a corporation. We will experience a relative increase in liquidity as additional subscriptions for shares of our common stock are received and a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate our assets.\nWe intend to make an election under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. If we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and may not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our qualification is denied unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our after-tax net income.\nWe will monitor the various qualification tests that we must meet to maintain our status as a REIT. Ownership of our shares will be monitored to ensure that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time after the first taxable year for which we make an election to be taxed as a REIT. We will also determine, on a quarterly basis, that the gross income, asset and distribution tests are met.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have not acquired any real estate investments or commenced material operations. However, as of March 24, 2016, we have accepted contributions of $2.2 million, broken escrow and have commenced material operations. Because we have not acquired any assets, we are not aware of any known trends or uncertainties material to our proposed operations, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, which may reasonably be anticipated to have a material impact on the capital resources and the revenue to be derived from the operation of our future assets.\nThe expenses incurred to date are primarily related to corporate general and administrative expenses, such as Board fees, directors and officers liability insurance and audit fees, that our Advisor has incurred on our behalf. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and for the period from November 12, 2013 (inception) to December 31, 2013, are not indicative of those expected in future periods. As we raise capital, we will make acquisitions of real estate and increase our borrowings, which will have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, or FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably overtime, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or is requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Additionally, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time. An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indicators exist and if the carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.\nHistorical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. However, FFO and MFFO, as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses. Our management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases. The Board, in consultation with our management, may determine that it is in our best interests to begin the process of considering alternatives with respect to a liquidity event (i.e., listing of its common stock on a national exchange, a merger or sale of us or another similar transaction) at such time during our offering stage as the Board can reasonably determine that all of the securities in the Offering will be sold within a reasonable time period (i.e. three to six months). Thus, we will not continuously purchase assets and will have a limited life.\nDue to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after the Offering has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after the Offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after the Offering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.\nOur MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition-related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses are paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which properties are acquired and will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired. MFFO that excludes such costs and expenses would only be comparable to non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activities and have similar operating characteristics as us. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. We view both gains and losses from dispositions of assets and fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance and calculating MFFO. While we are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of on-going operations. As disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report, the purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with those processes, are key operational features of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to investors. Acquisition fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by the Advisor if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares in the Offering, and therefore such fees and expenses may need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows.\nOur management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors. For example, acquisition costs are funded from the proceeds of the Offering and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.\nPresentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of its liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund its cash needs including its ability to make distributions to its stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in\nan offering such as the Offering (unless and until we calculate NAV prior to the close of the Offering) where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value and there is no NAV determination during the offering stage and for a period thereafter. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed. FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining FFO or MFFO. Since we had not begun operations as of the date of this Annual Report, we have not included a calculation of FFO or MFFO.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal demands for funds will be for property and real estate debt acquisitions, either directly or through investment interests, for the payment of operating expenses and distributions, and for the payment of interest on any outstanding indebtedness. Generally, cash needs for items other than property acquisitions will be met from operations, and cash needs for property acquisitions will be funded by our public offering of shares and debt. However, there may be a delay between the sale of our shares and our purchase of properties, which could result in a delay in the benefits to our stockholders, if any, of returns generated from our investment operations. As a result, we may increase leverage above our targeted level on a temporary basis in order to make current investments and then use proceeds from fundraising to lower the leverage. Over time, as we become established and the fundraising effort begins to scale, we do not expect our target leverage ratio to exceed 50% to 60% of the cost of our properties.\nThe Advisor will evaluate potential property acquisitions and engage in negotiations with sellers and lenders on our behalf. After a purchase contract is executed that contains specific terms, the property will not be purchased until the successful completion of due diligence, which includes review of the title insurance commitment, an appraisal and an environmental analysis. In some instances, the proposed acquisition will require the negotiation of final binding agreements, which may include financing documents. During this period, we may decide to temporarily invest any unused proceeds from the Offering in certain investments that could yield lower returns than properties we intend to acquire. These lower returns may affect our ability to make distributions.\nPotential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed modified funds from operations, or MFFO, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in case of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. We have not identified any sources of such financing.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe have not yet commenced material operations.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nOur cash used in investing activities will vary based on how quickly we raise funds in the Offering and how quickly we invest those funds towards acquisitions of real estate. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and for the period from November 12, 2013 (inception) to December 31, 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $0.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the Offering, net of distributions paid to our stockholders and the issuance of notes payable. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $0. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $199,900, which primarily related to a sale of 22,223 shares of our Class A common stock to our Advisor. During the period from November 12, 2013 (inception) to December 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $100, which related to our initial capitalization by an affiliate of our Advisor.\nObligations and Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding obligations or commitments that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIncome Taxes\nWe intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under the Code and intend to operate as such beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nDistributions\nThere were no distributions declared or paid during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWhen we have sufficient cash flow available to pay distributions, we intend to pay monthly distributions to our stockholders. As of the date of this Annual Report, we had no real estate investments. We will not make any real estate investments until we identify investment opportunities and raise sufficient capital pursuant to the Offering to do so. We cannot predict when we will begin to generate sufficient cash flow from these investments to pay distributions as a result of such investments. Because all of our operations will be performed indirectly through the OP, our ability to pay distributions depends on the OP's ability to pay distributions to its partners, including to us. If we do not have enough cash from operations to fund the distributions, we may borrow, issue additional securities or sell assets in order to fund the distributions or make the distributions out of net proceeds from the Offering. We have not established any limit on the amount of proceeds from the Offering that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus, unless our charter provides otherwise, senior liquidation preferences, if any.\nIn addition, the fees, distributions and reimbursements payable to the Advisor depend on various factors, including the assets we acquire, indebtedness incurred, and sales prices of investments sold, and therefore cannot be quantified or reserved for until such fees have been earned. We are required to pay these amounts to the Advisor regardless of the amount of cash we distribute to our stockholders and therefore our ability to make distributions from cash flow, as well as cash flow available for investment, to our stockholders may be negatively impacted.\nDistributions will be paid to our stockholders when and if authorized by the Board and declared by us out of legally available funds. We expect to declare and pay distributions on a monthly basis as of daily record dates. Distributions will be authorized at the discretion of the Board, which will be influenced in part by its intention to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code. We intend to make distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirement and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings; however, it may not always be possible to do so. Each distribution will be accompanied by a notice which sets forth: (a) the record date; (b) the amount per share that will be distributed; (c) the equivalent annualized yield; (d) the amount and percentage of the distributions paid from operations, offering proceeds and other sources; and (e) for those investors participating in the DRIP, a statement that a distribution statement will be provided in lieu of a check. The funds we receive from operations that are available for distribution may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:\n \u00b7 the amount of time required for us to invest the funds received in the Offering; \n \u00b7 our operating and interest expenses; \n \u00b7 operating results of our properties; \n \u00b7 the amount of distributions or dividends received by us from our indirect real estate investments; \n \u00b7 our ability to keep our properties occupied; \n \u00b7 our ability to maintain or increase rental rates when renewing or replacing current leases; \n \u00b7 capital expenditures and reserves for such expenditures; \n \u00b7 the issuance of additional shares; and \n \u00b7 financings and refinancings. \nWe must annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, in order to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code. The Board may authorize distributions in excess of this percentage as it deems appropriate. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year, distributions may not reflect our income earned in that particular distribution period, but may be made in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period and may be made in advance of actual receipt of funds in an attempt to make distributions relatively uniform. To allow for such differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses, and the effect of required debt payments, among other things, we could be required to borrow funds from third parties on a short-term basis, issue new securities, or sell assets to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. These methods of obtaining funding could affect future distributions by increasing operating costs and decreasing available cash. In addition, such distributions may constitute a return of capital.\nDistributions in kind will not be permitted, except for:\n \u00b7 distributions of readily marketable securities; \n \u00b7 distributions of beneficial interests in a liquidating trust established for our dissolution and the liquidation of our assets in accordance with the terms of our charter; or \n \u00b7 distributions of in-kind property, so long as, with respect to such in-kind property, the Board advises each stockholder of the risks associated with direct ownership of the property, offers each stockholder the election of receiving in-kind property distributions, and distributes in- kind property only to those stockholders who accept the directors' offer. \nShare Repurchase Program\nOur share repurchase program, as described below, may provide eligible stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell shares back to us, subject to restrictions and applicable law, if such repurchases do not impair our capital or operations. Specifically, state securities regulators impose investor suitability standards that establish specific financial thresholds that must be met by any investor in certain illiquid, long-term investments, including REIT shares.\nUntil the NAV pricing date, except with respect to repurchases sought within one year of a stockholder's death or Qualifying Disability (as determined by the applicable governmental agency), common stockholders must hold their shares for at least one year in order to participate in our share repurchase program.\nPrior to the time the Advisor begins calculating NAV, the price per share that we will pay to repurchase shares of our common stock will be as follows:\n \u00b7 for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least one year, the price will be the lower of $9.25 and 92.5% of the amount paid for each such share; \n \u00b7 for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least two years, the price will be the lower of $9.50 and 95.0% of the amount paid for each such share; \n \u00b7 for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least three years, the price will be the lower of $9.75 and 97.5% of the amount paid for each such share; \n \u00b7 for stockholders who have continuously held their shares of our common stock for at least four years, the price will be the lower of $10.00 and 100% of the amount paid for each such share; \nin each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of our share repurchase program, we intend to make repurchases, if requested, at least once quarterly. Each stockholder whose repurchase request is granted will receive the repurchase amount within 30 days after the fiscal quarter in which we grant the repurchase request. Subject to the limitations described in the prospectus, we also will repurchase shares upon the request of the estate, heir or beneficiary, as applicable, of a deceased stockholder. We will limit the number of shares repurchased pursuant to our share repurchase program in any calendar year to 5% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year. In addition, funds available for our share repurchase program are limited or described below and may not be sufficient to accommodate all requests. Due to these limitations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.\nFunding for the share repurchase program will be derived from proceeds we maintain from the sale of shares under the DRIP and other operating funds, if any, as our Board, in its sole discretion, may reserve for this purpose. We cannot guarantee that the funds set aside for the share repurchase program will be sufficient to accommodate all requests made each year. However, a stockholder may withdraw its request at any time or ask that we honor the request when funds are available. Pending repurchase requests will be honored on a pro rata basis.\nWhether the Advisor has begun NAV calculations or not, the share repurchase program will terminate immediately if our shares are listed on any national securities exchange. In addition, the Board may amend, suspend (in whole or in part) or terminate the share repurchase program at any time upon 30 days' notice. Further, the Board reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any requests for repurchases.\nDistribution Reinvestment Plan\nWe have adopted the DRIP. The following is a summary of the DRIP.\nInvestment of Distributions\nWe have adopted a DRIP pursuant to which our stockholders may elect to purchase shares of our common stock with our distributions. Distributions on Class A shares will be reinvested in Class A shares and distributions on Class T shares will be reinvested in Class T shares. We have the discretion to extend the offering period for the shares being offered under the DRIP beyond the termination of our primary offering until we have sold all the shares allocated to the DRIP. We also may offer shares under the DRIP pursuant to a new registration statement. We reserve the right to reallocate the shares of common stock we are offering between our primary offering and the DRIP. Any shares issued pursuant to the DRIP are subject to registration and renewal in any state in which such shares are offered and the offering of such shares is not exempt under applicable laws and regulations. Until the NAV pricing date, we will offer shares under our DRIP at $9.50 per Class A Share and $8.88 per Class T Share, which is 95% of the primary offering price. Thereafter, we will offer shares under our DRIP at per share NAV.\nNo dealer manager fees or selling commissions or, with respect to Class T shares, distribution fees, will be paid with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the DRIP; therefore, we will retain all of the proceeds from the reinvestment of distributions.\nPursuant to the terms of the DRIP, the reinvestment agent, which currently is us, will act on behalf of participants to reinvest the cash distributions they receive from us. Stockholders participating in the DRIP may purchase fractional shares. If sufficient shares are not available for issuance under the DRIP, the reinvestment agent will remit excess cash distributions to the participants. Participants purchasing shares pursuant to the DRIP will have the same rights as stockholders with respect to shares purchased under the DRIP and will be treated in the same manner as if such shares were issued pursuant to the primary offering.\nElection to Participate or Terminate Participation\nA stockholder may become a participant in the DRIP by making a written election to participate on his or her subscription agreement at the time he or she subscribes for shares. Any stockholder who has not previously elected to participate in the DRIP may so elect at any time by delivering to the reinvestment agent a completed enrollment form or other written authorization required by the reinvestment agent. Participation in the DRIP will commence with the next distribution payable after receipt of the participant's notice, provided it is received at least ten days prior to the last day of the fiscal quarter, month or other period to which the distribution relates.\nSome brokers may determine not to offer their clients the opportunity to participate in the DRIP. Any prospective investor who wishes to participate in the DRIP should consult with his or her broker as to the broker's position regarding participation in the DRIP.\nWe reserve the right to prohibit qualified retirement plans and other benefit plan investors\u201d (as defined in ERISA) from participating in the DRIP if such participation would cause our underlying assets to constitute plan assets\u201d of qualified retirement plans. A material change shall include any anticipated or actual decrease in net worth or annual gross income or any other change in circumstances that would cause the stockholder to fail to meet the suitability standards set forth in our prospectus for the stockholder's initial purchase of shares of common stock.\nEach stockholder electing to participate in the DRIP shall notify the reinvestment agent if any time during his or her participation in the DRIP, there is any material change in the stockholder's financial condition or inaccuracy of any representation under the subscription agreement for such stockholder's initial purchase of our shares.\nSubscribers should note that affirmative action in the form of written notice to the reinvestment agent must be taken to withdraw from participation in the DRIP. A withdrawal from participation in the DRIP will be effective with respect to distributions for a distribution period only if written notice of termination is received at least ten days prior to the end of such distribution period. In addition, a transfer of shares prior to the date our shares are listed for trading on a national securities exchange, which we have no intent to do at this time and which may never occur, will terminate participation in the DRIP with respect to such transferred shares as of the first day of the distribution period in which the transfer is effective, unless the transferee demonstrates to the reinvestment agent that the transferee meets the requirements for participation in the plan and affirmatively elects to participate in the DRIP by providing to the reinvestment agent an executed enrollment form or other written authorization required by the reinvestment agent.\nOffers and sales of shares pursuant to the DRIP must be registered in every state in which such offers and sales are made and the offering of such shares is not exempt under applicable laws and regulations. Generally, such registrations are for a period of one year. Thus, we may have to stop selling shares pursuant to the DRIP in any states in which our registration is not renewed or extended.\nReports to Participants\nWithin 90 days after the end of each calendar year, the reinvestment agent will mail to each participant a statement of account describing, as to such participant, the distributions received, the number of shares purchased, the purchase price for such shares and the total shares purchased on behalf of the participant during the prior year pursuant to the DRIP.\nExcluded Distributions\nThe Board may designate that certain cash or other distributions attributable to net sales proceeds will be excluded from distributions that may be reinvested in shares under the DRIP, or Excluded Distributions. Accordingly, if proceeds attributable to the potential sale transaction described above are distributed to stockholders as an Excluded Distribution, such amounts may not be reinvested in our shares pursuant to the DRIP. The determination of whether all or part of a distribution will be deemed to be an Excluded Distribution is separate and unrelated to our requirement to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income. In its initial determination of whether to make a distribution and the amount of the distribution, the Board will consider, among other factors, our cash position and our distribution requirements as a REIT. Once the Board determines to make the distribution, it will then consider whether all or part of the distribution will be deemed to be an Excluded Distribution. In most instances, we expect that the Board would not deem any of the distribution an Excluded Distribution. In that event, the amount distributed to participants in the DRIP will be reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. If all or a portion of the distribution is deemed an Excluded Distribution, the distribution will be made to all stockholders, however, the excluded portion will not be reinvested. As a result, we would not be able to use any of the Excluded Distribution to assist in meeting future distributions and the stockholders would not be able to use the distribution to purchase additional shares of our common stock through the DRIP. We currently do not have any planned Excluded Distributions, which will only be made, if at all, in addition to, not in lieu of, regular distributions.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nTaxable participants will incur tax liability even though they have elected not to receive their distributions in cash but rather to have their distributions reinvested under the DRIP. In addition, to the extent our stockholders purchase shares through the DRIP at a discount to their fair market value, they will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving an additional distribution equal to the amount of the discount. Until such time as we calculate NAV, we will sell shares pursuant to the DRIP at $9.50 per Class A Share and $8.88 per Class T Share, which is 95% of the primary offering price, and expect the Board to estimate the fair value of a share of our common stock to be $10.00, the offering price in the primary offering. Additionally, at least until our offering stage is complete, we expect that no secondary trading market for our shares will develop. Therefore, at least until we calculate NAV, participants in the DRIP will be treated as having received a distribution of $10.00 for each $9.50 per Class A Share and/or $8.88 per Class T Share reinvested by them under the DRIP. Our stockholders will be taxed on the amount of such distribution (including the discount from fair market value) as a dividend to the extent such distribution is from current or accumulated earnings and profits, unless we have designated all or a portion of the dividend as a capital gain dividend. Tax information regarding each participant's participation in the DRIP will be provided to each participant at least annually.\nAmendment, Suspension and Termination\nWe reserve the right to amend any aspect of, suspend, or terminate the DRIP for any reason at any time upon ten days' written notice to participants. The reinvestment agent also reserves the right to terminate a participant's individual participation in the DRIP (without terminating the DRIP generally), by sending ten days' prior written notice of termination to the terminated participant. Notices to a DRIP participant may be given by letter addressed to the participant at the participant's last address of record with the reinvestment agent or by providing the relevant information in a press release or a report filed by the company with the SEC.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with the Advisor and its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, the Advisor or its affiliates for acquisition and advisory fees and expenses, organization and offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution fees, reimbursement of certain operating costs, and possibly disposition fees. Refer to Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. It is at least reasonably possible that these estimates could change in the near term. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that will require our management to exercise their business judgment or make significant estimates:\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of the OP. The financial statements of the OP are prepared using accounting policies consistent with our policies. All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nReal Estate Investments\nUpon acquisition, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 805, Business Combinations, the purchase price of a property is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets. The purchase price allocation is based on management's estimate of the property's as-if\u201d vacant fair value. The as-if\u201d vacant fair value is calculated by using all available information such as the replacement cost of such asset, appraisals, property condition reports, market data and other related information. The allocation of the purchase price to intangible lease assets represents the value associated with the in-place leases, which may include lost rent, leasing commissions, legal and other related costs.\nIf any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value and the face value of the debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt assumed. Costs associated with the acquisition of a property, including acquisition fees paid, are expensed as incurred.\nReal estate assets, including land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and intangible lease assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs associated with the development and improvement of the Company's real estate assets are capitalized as incurred, Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred. Real estate-related depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as described in the following table:\n\nImpairment\nReal estate assets that are determined to be held and used will be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, and the Company will evaluate the recoverability of such real estate asset based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such real estate asset, and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the real estate asset. If impaired, the real estate asset will be written down to its estimated fair value.\nFair Value Measures and Financial Instruments\nFrom time to time, the Company records certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Real estate assets may be stated at fair value if they become impaired in a given period and may be stated at fair value if they are held for sale and the fair value of such assets is below historical cost. Additionally, the Company will record derivative financial instruments at fair value. The Company also uses fair value metrics to evaluate the carrying values of its real estate assets and for the disclosure of certain financial instruments.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\n \u00b7 Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. \n \u00b7 Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. \n \u00b7 Level 3 inputs are the unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumption, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on input from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. \nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company will utilize an independent third party to perform the allocation of value analysis for each property acquisition and also to perform the market valuations on interest rate caps and has established policies, as described above, processes and procedures intended to ensure that the valuation methodologies for investments and interest rate caps are fair and consistent as of the measurement date.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's primary operations will consist of rental income earned from its tenants under lease agreements with terms of one year or less. Rental income is recognized when earned. This policy effectively results in rental income recognition on the straight-line method over the related terms of the leases. Resident reimbursements and other income consist of charges billed to tenants for utilities, carport and garage rental, pets, administrative, application and other fees and are recognized when earned.\nOrganization and Offering Expenses\nOrganization and offering expenses include all expenses (other than selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and the distribution fee) to be paid by us in connection with the Offering. Organization and offering expenses include, but are not limited to: (i) legal, accounting, printing, mailing and filing fees; (ii) charges of our escrow agent; and (iii) due diligence expense reimbursements to participating broker-dealers.\nOrganization expenses will be expensed to us as incurred at the time that the Minimum Offering Requirement is achieved. Offering costs incurred by the Advisor and its affiliates on our behalf prior to that time are deferred and will be paid from the proceeds of the Offering. These costs will be treated as a reduction of the total proceeds. We will reimburse the Advisor and its affiliates for organization and offering expenses it incurs on our behalf, but only to the extent the reimbursement would not exceed 1.0% of the gross offering proceeds.\nAcquisition Costs\nAcquisition costs include costs incurred to acquire properties. The amount of acquisition costs incurred depends on the specific circumstances of each closing and are one-time costs associated with each acquisition. We may pay the Advisor an acquisition fee equal to 1.0% of the purchase price of each asset acquired, excluding any acquisition expenses.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company amortizes the fair value of stock-based compensation awards to expense over the vesting period and records any dividend equivalents earned as dividends for financial reporting purposes. Stock-based compensation awards are valued at the fair value on the date of grant and amortized as an expense over the vesting period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have elected to opt out\u201d of such extended transition period. Therefore, we intend to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the applicable dates on which the adoption of standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of such extended transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topics 205 and 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08\u201d). The updated guidance revised the definition of a discontinued operation by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity are classified as held for sale or disposed of by sale or by means other than a sale, such as an abandonment. Examples of a strategic shift could include a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment, or other major parts of an entity. In addition, ASU 2014-08 requires expanded disclosures for discontinued operations so users of the financial statements will be provided with more information about the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of discontinued operations. The Company implemented the provisions of ASU 2014-08 as of January 1, 2015.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018. The Company has not yet determined the impact of the new standard on its current policies for revenue recognition.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU No. 2014-15\u201d), which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption being permitted. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-15 as of January 1, 2017, and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items ( ASU 2015-01\u201d). The amendments in ASU No. 2015-01 eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Although the amendment will eliminate the requirements for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-01 as of January 1, 2016, and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. ASU 2015-02 also significantly changes how to evaluate voting rights for entities that are not similar to limited partnerships when determining whether the entity is a VIE, which may affect entities for which the decision making rights are conveyed through a contractual arrangement. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-02 as of January 1, 2016. The Company has not yet determined the impact of the new standard on its current policies for consolidation.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest ( ASU No. 2015-03\u201d), which changes the way reporting enterprises record debt issuance costs. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements ( ASU No. 2015-15\u201d). ASU 2015-15 supplements the requirements of ASU 2015-03 by allowing an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs related to a line of credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of January 1, 2016. The Company does not expect the new standards to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which changes certain recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU requires all equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or resulting in consolidation, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, amends the presentation requirements for changes in the fair value of financial liabilities, requires presentation of financial instruments by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nInflation\nConsistent with the multifamily property focus, we anticipate that the leases we enter into for multifamily apartment homes will be for a term of one year or less. These terms provide us with maximum flexibility to implement rental increases when the market will bear such increases and may provide us with a hedge against inflation.\nREIT Tax Election\nWe intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under the Code and intend to operate as such beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or the first year in which we commence material operations, if later. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nValuation Guidelines; Calculation of NAV\nUntil April 11, 2016, the date that the amendments to FINRA Rule 2340 take effect (or earlier if the Board determines it is in our best interest), we expect to use $10.00 and $9.35 as the estimated NAV per Class A share and Class T share, respectively. Following such date, if we have not yet disclosed an estimated NAV per share, then our stockholders' customer account statements will include a value per share that is equal to the public offering price less all up-front underwriting compensation and certain organization and offering expenses. If we provide an estimated NAV prior to the conclusion of the Offering, the Board may determine to modify the public offering price, including the price at which shares are offered through our DRIP, to reflect the estimated per share NAV. We are not required to provide an estimated NAV based on the value of our assets until a date no later than 150 days following the second anniversary of the date we break escrow in the Offering. Prior to providing an estimated NAV based on a valuation of our assets, the per share values that we report will not reflect the proceeds our stockholders would receive upon liquidation or upon the sale of their shares. Furthermore, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us, or any liquidating distribution of our assets, then such assets, or the proceeds therefrom, will be distributed between the holders of Class A shares and Class T shares ratably in proportion to the respective NAV for each class until the NAV for each class has been paid. The NAV will be calculated on a company-wide basis, with any adjustments to Class A or Class T shares made subsequent to such company-wide calculation. For purposes of calculating NAV, we intend to use the most recent price paid to acquire the applicable class of shares in the primary Offering (ignoring purchase price discounts for certain categories of purchasers) as the estimated per share value of our shares until the Board determines our NAV. Each holder of shares of a particular class of common stock will be entitled to receive, ratably with each other holder of shares of such class, that portion of such aggregate assets available for distribution as the number of outstanding shares of such class held by such holder bears to the total number of outstanding shares of such class then outstanding. If we provide an estimated NAV prior to the conclusion of the Offering, the Board may determine to modify the public offering price to reflect the estimated per share NAV.\nPrior to 150 days following the second anniversary of the date we break escrow in the Offering (or earlier if the Board so directs or applicable regulations require), we are required to provide an initial estimated NAV per share of each class of our common stock based on the value of our assets. We will provide an update of the initial estimated NAV as of the end of each completed fiscal quarter (or fiscal year, in the case of a quarter ending at a fiscal year-end) thereafter. Once we are required to provide an estimated NAV per share, our NAV will be determined by the Board based on the input of the Advisor, our audit committee and, if engaged by the Board, one or more independent valuation firms. We intend to base our calculation of estimated NAV on the values of our assets and liabilities, without ascribing additional value to our enterprise or the going concern of our business. We expect that the values of our assets and liabilities will reflect the specific terms of our investments and our indebtedness, as well as conditions prevailing in the real estate, credit and broader financial markets. In addition, on a quarterly basis, management will update our NAV to reflect changes in the fair value of our indebtedness, estimated property disposition costs (including estimates of fees payable to the Advisor), and our other net assets and liabilities. In general, we expect to report our quarterly estimated NAV in filings with the SEC and on our website.\nSubsequent Events\nStatus of Our Offering\nAs of March 25, 2016, we had sold approximately 217,391 shares of Class A common stock in our initial public offering for gross proceeds of $2.0 million, or $9.20 per share, reflecting the fact that selling commissions and dealer manager fees were not paid in connection with the sale. On March 24, 2016, we released $2.0 million that was held in escrow, thus satisfying the Minimum Offering Requirement to break escrow and allow us to commence material operations.\nIssuance of Restricted Stock to Our Independent Directors\nPursuant to our restricted share plan, upon the initial release from escrow of $2.0 million, each of our two independent directors, John Pons and D. Kirk McAllaster, Jr., received a grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Class A common stock. The shares of restricted Class A common stock vest in equal amounts annually over a four-year period following the first anniversary of the date of grant in increments of 25% per annum.\nAmendment to Escrow Agreement\nOn January 20, 2016, upon unanimous approval of the Board, including its independent directors, the Company amended the escrow agreement with the Dealer Manager and UMB Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the Escrow Agent\u201d), which reduced the Minimum Offering Requirement from $10.0 million to $2.0 million in gross offering proceeds prior to the release to us by the Escrow Agent. The proceeds from residents of the State of Pennsylvania and the State of Washington will remain in the escrow account until total subscriptions (including amounts previously disbursed to us and the amounts then held in the escrow account) equal or exceed $50 million and $20 million, respectively.\nAmendment to Dealer Manager Agreement\nOn March 23, 2016, upon unanimous approval of the Board, including its independent directors, the Company amended the Dealer Manager Agreement with the Dealer Manager which reduced dealer manager fees on Class A and Class T common shares from 3.0% to 1.0% and reduced the reimbursement to our Advisor of organization and offering expenses from 1.5% to 1.0% of gross offering proceeds.", "item_7_tables": "Table 117: <table> <tr> <td> Land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Not depreciated\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Buildings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Furniture, fixtures, and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intangible lease assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6 months\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "**Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) Summary for NexPoint Multifamily Realty Trust, Inc.**\n\n**Overview:**\nNexPoint Multifamily Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, aims to qualify as a real estate investment trust (REIT) starting with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016, or when material operations commence if that is later. The corporation is focused on acquiring, owning, operating, and selectively developing core-plus multifamily properties, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. Most properties are expected to be in the $20 million to $30 million price range, with value-add components through modest upgrades or renovations to increase rent. An average investment of $1,000 - $4,000 per unit will be made within the first 24 months of ownership for these improvements.\n\n**Offering:**\nA Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC allowed for up to $1.0 billion in common stock offering and up to $100 million through a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP). Two classes of common stock (Class A and Class T) offered at $10.00 and $9.35 per share, respectively, initially with DRIP shares at slightly lower prices. The offering could be extended until August 12, 2017.\n\n**Operations and Investment Strategy:**\nThe company's Advisor oversees day-to-day operations and portfolio management, with property purchases up to $15.0 million allowed without specific Board approval, provided they meet investment guidelines. Investments greater than $15.0 million or those breaching guidelines require Board approval.\n\nOn March 24, 2016, the company met its minimum offering amount, raised $2.0 million, broke escrow, and commenced material operations. The company had not acquired real estate investments or started material operations as of the report\u2019s date.\n\n**Financial Analysis:**\n\n- **Non-GAAP Measurements:** FFO (Funds from Operations) and MFFO (Modified Funds from Operations) are provided as supplemental performance measures, despite not being equivalent to net income as per GAAP.\n\n- **Liquidity and Capital Resources:** The company's principal funding needs stem from property acquisitions. Operating expenses and distributions may be funded from operations or loan proceeds.\n\n- **Cash Flows:** The company had not begun material operations, hence had no reportable cash flow from operations or investing activities as of the report\u2019s date.\n\n- **Income Taxes:** NexPoint plans to operate as a REIT, typically not subject to federal income tax on income distributed to stockholders.\n\n- **Distributions:** No distributions were declared or paid during the reported period.\n\n- **Accounting Policies:** Various critical accounting policies, including consolidation principles, revenue recognition, and fair value measurements, are outlined.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Offering Status:** Over 217,000 shares sold, grossing $2.0 million, allowing the company to commence material operations.\n\n- **Restricted Stock Issue:** Independent directors were granted restricted stock, vesting annually over a four-year period.\n\n- **Amendments:** Changes to the escrow requirement and dealer manager agreement were made, reducing the Minimum Offering Requirement to $2.0 million and adjusting fees and reimbursements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNexPoint Multifamily Realty Trust, Inc. is in its early stages, primarily focusing on acquiring and operating multifamily real estate. It had successfully raised enough capital to initiate material operations and had outlined its financial strategy, including management by its Advisor and Board of Directors."}
