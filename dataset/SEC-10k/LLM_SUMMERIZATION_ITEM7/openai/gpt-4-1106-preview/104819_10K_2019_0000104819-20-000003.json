MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIntroduction\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Management's Discussion and Analysis) analyzes the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Washington Gas. This discussion follows the format permitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2) of Form 10-K, in light of Washington Gas' status as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AltaGas as permitted under General Instruction I(1) of Form 10-K. It includes management's narrative analysis of results of operations and reasons for material changes. This narrative discusses past financial results and potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage them. Except where the content clearly indicates otherwise, Washington Gas,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the \"Company\" refers to Washington Gas Light Company.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis is designed to provide an understanding of our operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with the company's financial statements and the Notes to Financial Statements.\nExecutive Overview\nWashington Gas has one operating segment that engages in its core business of delivering and selling natural gas under tariffs approved by regulatory commissions in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. Net income was $99.8 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a net loss of $35.4 million for the same period ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income was mainly from $58.0 million increase in operating revenues driven by the impact of rate cases, accelerated pipe replacement programs and customer growth, and a $159.5 million decrease in operation and maintenance due to the lower merger commitments and related costs.\nFactors critical to the success of Washington Gas include: (i) operating a safe and reliable natural gas distribution system; (ii) having sufficient natural gas supplies to meet customer demands; (iii) being competitive with other sources of energy such as electricity, fuel oil and propane; (iv) having access to sources of liquidity; (v) recovering the costs and expenses of this business in the rates charged to customers, and (vi) earning a fair, just and reasonable rate of return on invested capital.\nResults of Operations\nOur chief operating decision maker utilizes the non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, as the primary measure of profit and loss in assessing the results of operations. We believe that our use of EBITDA enhances the ability to evaluate Washington Gas' performance because it excludes interest and income tax expense, which are affected by corporate-wide strategies of AltaGas such as capital financing. It also excludes depreciation and amortization which do not affect cash flows.\nEBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of our operating performance than, net income.\nThe following table reconciles EBITDA to net income for the calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2018 mainly driven by the impact of rate cases, accelerated pipe replacement programs, customer growth and other increases from conservation programs, recovery of various costs, and increases from interruptible and special contracts. We also utilize the non-GAAP measure of net revenues, calculated as revenues less the associated cost of energy and applicable revenue taxes, to assist in the analysis of profitability. The cost of the natural gas commodity (as adjusted for Asset Optimization sharing) and revenue taxes are included in the rates that Washington Gas charges to customers as reflected in operating revenues. Accordingly, changes in the cost of gas and revenue taxes associated with sales made to customers generally have no direct effect on utility net revenues, operating income or net income. Net revenues should not be considered an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of our operating performance than, operating revenues. Additionally, net revenues may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The table above reconciles net revenues to operating revenues for the reporting periods as part of the reconciliation of operating revenues to EBITDA. Net revenues increased by $36.2 million in the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 compared to calendar year 2018.\nThe following are the main drivers noted above for the increase in operating revenues, as well as the additional drivers for the increase in net revenues:\nImpact of rate cases. $16.2 million increase due to new base rates in Maryland, effective December 2018. Refer to Rates and Regulatory Matters\u201d for further discussion of these matters.\nAccelerated replacement programs. $11.7 million increase due to approved accelerated replacement programs that were in place with an associated surcharge mechanism to recover the cost, including a return, on those capital investments.\nCustomer growth. $6.3 million increase due to customer growth. At the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, average active customer meters increased by approximately 12,000 over the number of average active customer meters for the same period of 2018, contributing to the increase. Adding new customers directly drives earnings growth through additional distribution revenues.\nAsset optimization. $11.0 million decrease due to asset optimization. We recorded a net gain of $18.5 million including an unrealized gain of $5.4 million associated with our energy-related derivatives for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net gain of $29.5 million including an unrealized gain of $7.6 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018.\nEstimated effects of weather and consumption patterns. Weather, when measured by HDDs, was 7.9% and 2.5% warmer than normal for the calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, driving lower net revenues of $3.0 million. In the District of Columbia, where Washington Gas does not have a billing mechanism or financial instruments to offset the effects of weather, the comparatively warmer weather for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a negative variance to net revenues. Natural gas consumption patterns may be affected by shifts in weather patterns in which customer heating usage may not correlate highly with average historical levels of usage per heating degree days that occur. Natural gas consumption patterns may also be affected by non-weather related factors such as customer conservation. Refer to the section entitled \"Weather Risk\" for a discussion of billing mechanisms in Maryland and Virginia, which are designed to eliminate the net revenue effects of variations in customer usage caused by weather and other factors such as conservation.\nOther. $16.0 million increase from conservation programs, recovery of various costs, and increases from interruptible and special contracts.\nOperation and Maintenance Expenses\nOperating and maintenance expenses decreased $159.5 million in calendar year 2019 compared to calendar year 2018. The decrease was mainly driven by lower Merger commitments and related costs, offset by higher employee labor costs and benefits, corporate shared service cost paid to AltaGas after the Merger, and higher cost on safety and reliability activities including leak repair and mitigation.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe $6.2 million increase between calendar year 2019 and 2018 represented higher depreciation expense on capital additions.\nOther income (expense)\nThe $14.6 million increase in other income (expenses) for the calendar year 2019 compared to the calendar year 2018 was mainly driven by $13.5 million expense for charitable contributions as part of the Merger commitments that were recorded in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate for calendar year 2019 was 16.0% compared to 54.8% for calendar year 2018. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to adjustments related to the amortization of excess deferred taxes. Refer to Note 9 - Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements for details.\nStatistical Information\nKey gas delivery, weather and meter statistics are shown in the table below for the calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas Deliveries, Weather and Meter Statistics\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Calendar Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended September 30,\n</td> <td>Increase (decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>Calendar\nYear 2019\nvs.\n</td> <td>Three Months 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2018\nvs.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas Sales and Deliveries (millions of therms)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm\n</td> <td>1,410.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,461.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>473.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>441.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,455.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,269.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interruptible\n</td> <td>259.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric generation\n</td> <td>67.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(105.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>93.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deliveries\n</td> <td>1,773.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,917.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>565.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>545.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,886.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,602.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(144.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>284.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Degree Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Actual\n</td> <td>3,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(268\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Normal\n</td> <td>3,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent colder (warmer) than normal\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(21.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average active customer meters\n</td> <td>1,189,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,177,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,181,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,167,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,173,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,155,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending active customer meters\n</td> <td>1,192,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,184,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,184,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,169,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,177,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,163,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New customer meters added\n</td> <td>11,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(457\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGas Service to Firm Customers\nThe volume of gas delivered to firm customers is highly sensitive to weather variability as a large portion of the natural gas delivered by Washington Gas is used for space heating. Washington Gas' rates are based on an assumption of normal weather. The tariffs in the Maryland and Virginia jurisdictions include provisions that consider the effects of the RNA and the WNA/CRA mechanisms, respectively, that are designed to, among other things, eliminate the effect on net revenues of variations in weather from normal levels (refer to the section entitled Weather Risk\u201d for a further discussion of these mechanisms and other weather-related instruments included in our weather protection strategy).\nDuring the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, the comparison in natural gas deliveries to firm customers primarily reflects 7.9% warmer than normal weather when measured by HDDs, compared to 2.5% warmer than normal weather for the prior year. We also had an increase in average active customer meters of approximately 12,000 during the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the prior year.\nMany customers choose to buy the natural gas commodity from unregulated third-party marketers, rather than purchase the natural gas commodity and delivery service from Washington Gas on a bundled basis. This does not affect Washington Gas' net income because Washington Gas charges its customers the cost of gas without any mark-up. Of Washington Gas' 1.2 million\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nactive customers at December 31, 2019, approximately 171,000 customers purchased their natural gas commodity from unregulated third-party marketers.\nGas Service to Interruptible Customers\nWashington Gas must curtail or interrupt service to this class of customer when the demand by firm customers exceeds specified levels. Therm deliveries to interruptible customers increased by 13.9 million therms during the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased demand in 2019.\nIn the District of Columbia, the effect on net income of any changes in delivered volumes and prices to interruptible customers is limited by margin-sharing arrangements that are included in Washington Gas' firm rate designs. Rates for interruptible customers in Maryland and Virginia are based on a traditional cost of service approach. In Virginia, Washington Gas retains a majority of the margins earned on interruptible gas and delivery sales. Washington Gas shares actual non-gas margins from interruptible sales service customers that are in excess of delivery service rates. In Maryland, Washington Gas retains a defined amount of revenues based on a set threshold. Effective December 2018, Washington Gas no longer shares interruptible margins in Maryland.\nGas Service for Electric Generation\nWashington Gas delivers natural gas for use at two electric generation facilities in Maryland that are each owned by companies independent of WGL. During the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, deliveries to these customers decreased by 105.8 million therms from the calendar year 2018. Washington Gas shares with firm customers a significant majority of the margins earned from natural gas deliveries to these customers. Therefore, changes in the volume of interruptible gas deliveries to these customers do not materially affect either net revenues or net income.\nCost of Gas\nWashington Gas' cost of natural gas purchased includes both fixed and variable components. Washington Gas pays fixed costs or demand charges\u201d to pipeline companies for system capacity needed to transport and store natural gas. Washington Gas pays variable costs, or the cost of the natural gas commodity itself, to natural gas producers and suppliers. Variations in the utility's cost of gas expense result from changes in gas sales volumes, the price of the gas purchased and the level of gas costs collected through the operation of firm gas cost recovery mechanisms. Under these regulated recovery mechanisms, Washington Gas records cost of gas expense equal to the cost of gas recovered from customers and included in revenues. The difference between the firm gas costs incurred and the gas costs recovered from customers is deferred on the balance sheet as an amount to be collected from or refunded to customers in future periods. Therefore, increases or decreases in the cost of gas associated with sales made to firm customers have no direct effect on Washington Gas' net revenues and net income. Changes in the cost of gas can cause significant variations in Washington Gas' cash provided by or used in operating activities. Washington Gas receives from or pays to its customers in the District of Columbia and Virginia, carrying costs associated with under-collected or over-collected gas costs recovered from its customers using short-term interest rates. Additionally, included in Utility cost of gas\u201d for Washington Gas are the net margins associated with our asset optimization program. To the extent these amounts are shared with customers, they are a reduction to the cost of gas invoiced to customers. Refer to the section entitled Market Risk\u201d for a further discussion of Washington Gas' optimization program.\nThe average commodity cost of gas invoiced to Washington Gas (excluding the cost and related volumes applicable to asset optimization) were $0.28, $0.37, $0.30, and $0.27 per therm for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, three months ended December 31, 2018, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral Factors Affecting Liquidity\nWashington Gas generally meets its liquidity and capital needs through cash on hand, retained earnings, the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, and equity infusions from its parent holding companies, routed through Wrangler. Access to short-term debt markets is necessary for funding our short-term liquidity requirements, the most significant of which include buying natural gas and pipeline capacity, and financing both accounts receivable and storage gas inventory. We have accessed long-term capital markets primarily to fund capital expenditures and retire long-term debt. Under the Merger commitments agreed to by AltaGas and Washington Gas during the Merger and other rules imposed by regulatory commissions or laws in Washington Gas' service territory, the Company is prohibited and/or restricted in its ability to make advances or issue loans to an affiliate or parent holding company without prior regulatory commission approval.\nOur plans provide sufficient liquidity to satisfy our financial obligations. Generally, pursuant to its Merger commitments, Washington Gas can make dividend payments in the ordinary course of business unless any of the following regulatory\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nlimitations apply: (i) Washington Gas will not pay extraordinary dividends to its parent for three years from the date of the Merger close, (ii) Washington Gas will not pay dividends to its parent company if Washington Gas' senior unsecured debt rating is below investment grade or (iii) Washington Gas will not make a dividend payment to its parent company if the payment would result in its equity level to drop below 48%. At December 31, 2019, we had no significant restrictions on our cash balances or retained earnings that would affect the payment of dividends.\nShort-Term Cash Requirements and Related Financing\nWashington Gas has seasonal short-term cash requirements to fund the purchase of storage gas inventory in advance of the winter heating season. The Company collects the cost of gas under cost recovery mechanisms approved by our regulators.\nIn the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year, Washington Gas' large sales volumes cause its cash requirements to peak when combined storage inventory, accounts receivable, and unbilled revenues are at their highest levels. In the second and third quarters of each calendar year, after the heating season, Washington Gas typically experiences a seasonal net loss due to reduced demand for natural gas. During this period, large amounts of Washington Gas' current assets are converted to cash.\nWashington Gas uses short-term debt in the form of commercial paper or unsecured short-term bank loans to fund seasonal cash requirements. Our policy is to maintain back-up bank credit facilities in an amount equal to or greater than our expected maximum commercial paper position. In December 2019, we classified $100.0 million commercial paper balance as \"Long-term debt\" on Washington Gas' balance sheets due to its ability and intent to refinance these balances on a long-term basis.\nOn July 19, 2019, Washington Gas entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a term of five years, plus two one-year extension options, available with the bank group's approval (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility amended and restated Washington Gas' prior $350 million credit facility and permits Washington Gas to borrow up to $450 million with an option to increase the facility by an additional $100 million with the bank group's approval, for a total potential maximum borrowing of $550 million. The interest rate of loans made under the credit facilities will be a fluctuating rate per annum that will be set using certain parameters at the time each loan is made. Bank credit balances available to Washington Gas under the existing credit facility, net of commercial paper balances were $50.0 million and $54.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLong-Term Cash Requirements and Related Financing\nThe primary drivers of our long-term cash requirements are capital expenditures and long-term debt maturities. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to adding new utility customers and system supply and maintaining the safety and reliability of Washington Gas' distribution system.\nSecurity Ratings\nOn December 11, 2019, Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P) revised its outlook on AltaGas from negative to stable, and raised the senior unsecured debt credit rating for Washington Gas from BBB+ to A- and its outlook from negative to stable. Washington Gas has ring fencing measures in place that financially separate Washington Gas from WGL, AltaGas and its affiliates as a way to protect its consumers from financial instability or bankruptcy that may be experienced by Washington Gas' parents or affiliates. S&P views the ring-fencing provisions sufficient to insulate Washington Gas from AltaGas and its other subsidiaries to warrant three-notches of ratings separation between Washington Gas and AltaGas. The credit rating for Washington Gas' commercial paper remained at A-2.\nOn January 30, 2020, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) downgraded the ratings of Washington Gas' senior unsecured debt credit rating to A3 from A2 and its commercial paper rating to P-2 from P-1. The outlook for Washington Gas is stable. Moody's affirmed the ratings of WGL's Baa1 for senior unsecured rating and P-2 commercial paper rating and changed its outlook to stable from negative.\nThe table below reflects the credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of Washington Gas as of December 31, 2019.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nUnder the terms of Washington Gas' revolving credit agreements and private placement notes, the ratio of consolidated financial indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0 (65.0%). At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Washington Gas' ratios of consolidated financial indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization were 52% and 47%, respectively. In addition, Washington Gas is required to inform lenders of changes in corporate existence, financial conditions, litigation and environmental warranties that might have a material effect on debt ratings. The failure to inform the lenders' agent of material changes in these areas might constitute default under the agreements. Additionally, failure to pay principal or interest on any other indebtedness may be deemed a default under our credit agreements. A default, if not remedied, may lead to a suspension of further loans and/or acceleration in which obligations become immediately due and payable. In addition, certain of the credit facilities of Washington Gas contain cross-default provisions. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our revolving credit facilities, term loan facility, and private placement notes.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes Washington Gas' net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Calendar Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n(Unaudited)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n(Unaudited)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>Calendar year\n</td> <td>Three Months\n</td> <td>Fiscal year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\nvs. 2018\n</td> <td>2018\nvs. 2017\n</td> <td>2018\nvs. 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(94.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(85.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>448.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(229.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(433.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(440.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(126.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(75.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(389.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(403.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nWashington Gas' cash flows from operating activities principally reflect gas sales and deliveries and the cost of operations. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $203.3 million for the calendar year 2019, a $147.0 million increase from calendar year 2018. The increase was mainly driven by decreased cash payments for Merger commitments and related costs due to the Merger in 2018.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities was $219.4 million in the calendar year 2019 compared to $448.8 million in 2018. The $219.4 million cash flows from financing activities in 2019 was mainly driven by $298.5 million proceeds from issuance of medium-term note in September 2019, $103.5 million net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, offset by $50.0 million long-term debt repayment and $100.7 million in dividend payments on preferred and common stocks. Additionally, we paid $28.7 million to redeem three outstanding series of preferred stock in December 2019. The $448.8 million cash flows from financing activities in 2018 was mainly driven by $402.7 million capital infusion from our parent company, $134.0 million net proceeds from short-term borrowings, offset by $50 million long-term debt repayment and $90.8 million dividend payments on preferred and common stocks in 2018.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7.

In addition, there are certain regulatory commitments that were and will be expensed as the costs are incurred, including the hiring of damage prevention trainers in each jurisdiction for a total of $2.4 million over 5 years; investing up to $70.0 million over a 10 year period to further extend natural gas service; and spending $8.0 million for leak mitigation within 3 years after the Merger close.\nThe table above reflects fixed and variable obligations. Certain of these estimates reflect likely purchases under various contracts and may differ from minimum future contractual commitments disclosed in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nFor commitments related to Washington Gas' pension and post-retirement benefit plans, refer to Note 10 - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk\nWholesale Credit Risk\nWashington Gas enters into transactions with wholesale counterparties for the purpose of meeting firm ratepayer commitments, to optimize the value of its long-term capacity assets, and for hedging natural gas costs. Certain wholesale suppliers that sell natural gas to Washington Gas may have relatively low credit ratings or may not be rated by major credit rating agencies. In the event of a counterparty's failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas or fulfill its payment obligations, Washington Gas may incur losses that would typically be passed through to its sales customers under the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; however, Washington Gas may be at risk for financial loss to the extent these losses are not passed through to its customers.\nWashington Gas operates under an existing wholesale counterparty credit policy that is designed to mitigate credit risks through requirements for credit enhancements including, but not limited to, letters of credit, parent guarantees and cash collateral when deemed necessary. In accordance with this policy, Washington Gas has obtained credit enhancements from certain of its counterparties. If certain counterparties or their guarantors meet the policy's creditworthiness criteria, Washington Gas may grant unsecured credit to those counterparties or their guarantors. The creditworthiness of all counterparties is continuously monitored.\nThe following table provides information on our credit exposure, net of collateral, to wholesale counterparties as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Exposure to Wholesale Counterparties (In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating(a)\n</td> <td>Exposure\nBefore Credit\nCollateral(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Offsetting Credit\nCollateral Held(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nExposure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nCounterparties\nGreater Than\n10%(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Exposure of\nCounterparties\nGreater Than 10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Grade\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Investment Grade\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>No External Ratings\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Investment grade is primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty. If the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher-rated entity (e.g., its parent), it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor. Included in Investment grade\u201d are counterparties with a minimum Standard & Poor's or Moody's Investor Service rating of BBB- or Baa3, respectively.\n(b) Includes the net of all open positions on energy-related derivatives subject to mark-to-market accounting requirements and the net receivable/payable for the realized transactions. Amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that contractual netting arrangements are in place.\n(c) Represents cash deposits and letters of credit received from counterparties, not adjusted for probability of default.\n(d) Using a percentage of the net exposure.\nRetail Credit Risk\nWashington Gas is at risk of non-payment of utility bills by customers. To manage this customer credit risk, Washington Gas may require cash deposits from high risk customers to cover payment of their bills until the requirements for the deposit refunds are met. Base rates include a provision for recovery of uncollectible accounts based on historical levels of charge offs of accounts receivable. Washington Gas also has a provision in its Gas Administrative Charge mechanism that includes an\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nallowance for commodity amounts included in uncollectible accounts. In addition, Washington Gas has a POR program in Maryland and the District of Columbia, whereby it purchases receivables from participating energy marketers at approved discount rates, which incorporates the risk of non-payment by the retail customers for these receivables.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity price risk, weather risk and interest-rate risk. The following discussion describes these risks and our management of them.\nPrice Risk\nWashington Gas faces price risk associated with the purchase and sale of natural gas. Washington Gas generally recovers the cost of the natural gas to serve customers through gas cost recovery mechanisms as approved in jurisdictional tariffs; therefore, a change in the price of natural gas generally has no direct effect on Washington Gas' net income. However, Washington Gas is responsible for following competitive and reasonable practices in purchasing natural gas for its customers.\nTo manage price risk associated with its natural gas supply to its firm customers, Washington Gas: (i) actively manages its gas supply portfolio to balance sales and delivery obligations; (ii) injects natural gas into storage during the summer months when prices are generally lower, and withdraws that gas during the winter heating season when prices are generally higher and (iii) enters into hedging contracts and other contracts that may qualify as derivative instruments related to the sale and purchase of natural gas.\nWashington Gas executes commodity-related physical and financial contracts in the form of forward, futures and option contracts as part of an asset optimization program that is managed by its internal staff. Under this program, Washington Gas realizes value from its long-term natural gas transportation and storage capacity resources when they are not being fully used to serve utility customers. Regulatory sharing mechanisms in all three jurisdictions allow the profit from these transactions to be shared between Washington Gas' customers and shareholders.\nThe following two tables summarize the changes in the fair value of our net assets (liabilities) associated with the energy-related derivatives during the calendar year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in Fair Value of Energy-Related Derivatives\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets (liabilities) at January 1, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(106.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net fair value of contracts entered into during the period\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other changes in net fair value\n</td> <td>27.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized net settlement of derivatives\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(91.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\nRoll Forward of Energy-Related Derivatives\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets (liabilities) at January 1, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(106.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recorded to income\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recorded to regulatory assets/liabilities\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized net settlement of derivatives\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(91.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe maturity dates in calendar years of our net assets (liabilities) associated with the energy-related derivatives recorded at fair value at December 31, 2019, is summarized in the following table based on the level of the fair value calculation under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7.

Weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered by Washington Gas. Weather patterns tend to be more volatile during shoulder\u201d months within our calendar year in which Washington Gas is going into or coming out of the winter heating season. During the shoulder months within quarters ending June 30 (particularly in April and May) and December 31 (particularly in October and November), customer heating usage may not highly correlate with historical levels or with the level of heating degree days that occur, particularly when weather patterns experienced are not consistently cold or warm.\nWashington Gas does not have a weather related instrument or billing adjustment mechanism in the District of Columbia and as a result, its revenues are volume driven and current rates are based upon an assumption of normal weather. Without weather protection strategies, variations from normal weather will cause our earnings to increase or decrease depending on the weather pattern.\nBilling Adjustment Mechanisms. In Maryland, Washington Gas has an RNA billing mechanism that is designed to stabilize the level of net revenues collected from Maryland customers by eliminating the effect of deviations in customer usage caused by variations in weather from normal levels and other factors such as conservation. In Virginia, Washington Gas has a WNA billing adjustment mechanism that is designed to eliminate the effect of variations in weather from normal levels on utility net revenues for residential, commercial and industrial and group metered apartment customers. Additionally, in Virginia, as part of the CARE plan, Washington Gas has a CRA mechanism that eliminates the effect of conservation for residential customers.\nInterest-Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest-rate risk associated with our short-term and long-term financing. Washington Gas has previously utilized derivative instruments in order to reduce its exposure to the risk of interest-rate volatility, with resulting gains and losses typically being recovered through each jurisdiction's overall allowed rate of return.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, Washington Gas had outstanding commercial paper and project financing of $399.5 million and $311.5 million, respectively. The carrying amount of commercial paper and project financing approximates their fair value. At December 31, 2019, a change of 100 basis points in the underlying average interest rate for our commercial paper would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately $2.3 million.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, Washington Gas had outstanding fixed-rate MTNs and other long-term debt of $1,330.9 million and $1,035.0 million, respectively, excluding current maturities and commercial paper. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of Washington Gas' fixed-rate debt was $1,480.8 million. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that fair value would increase by approximately $77.3 million or decrease by approximately $71.6 million if interest rates were to decline or increase by 10%, respectively, from current market levels. In general, such an increase or decrease in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if Washington Gas were to reacquire some or all of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity.\nAt December 31, 2019, a total of $1,202.5 million, or approximately 89.3% of the face amount of Washington Gas' outstanding long-term debt, excluding current maturities and commercial paper, have make-whole call options which would require us to pay a premium over the face amount if we were to exercise them.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7.

Refer to the section \"Accelerated Pipe Replacement Programs\" above for a discussion of regulatory matters associated with those programs.\nDistrict of Columbia Jurisdiction\nPROJECTpipes 2 Plan. On December 7, 2018, Washington Gas filed a request with the PSC of DC for approval of the PROJECTpipes 2 Plan, the second phase of Washington Gas' APRP, to cover the period from October 1, 2019 through December 31, 2024. The PROJECTpipes 2 Plan seeks to address relatively higher risk pipe associated with an aging infrastructure by replacing pipe materials and components, as well as adding new features to enhance the safety of Washington Gas' system, with an estimated total cost of $305.3 million. On September 5, 2019, the PSC of DC issued an order extending the original PROJECTpipes an additional six months through March 31, 2020, in an amount not to exceed $12.5 million. On September 13, 2019, Washington Gas submitted a revised five year final annual project list. The parties are engaged in settlement negotiations, as directed by the PSC of DC. On February 14, 2020, a final settlement conference report was submitted, and the PSC of DC continues to review the PROJECTpipes 2 Plan.\nDistrict of Columbia 2020 Rate Case. On January 13, 2020, Washington Gas filed an application for authority to increase charges for gas service in the District of Columbia. The requested rates are designed to collect approximately $35.2 million in total annual revenues. Of the approximate $35.2 million revenue increase requested, $9.1 million represents costs collected through the PROJECTpipes surcharge; therefore, the incremental amount of the base rate increase is approximately $26.1 million. The Company requests that new rates be implemented by January 1, 2021.\nMaryland Jurisdiction\nMaryland Rate Case 2019. On April 22, 2019, Washington Gas filed an application with the PSC of MD to increase its base rates for natural gas service, generating $30.8 million in additional annual revenue. The revenue increase represented an increase in base rates of $35.9 million, of which approximately $5.0 million relates to costs being collected through the monthly STRIDE surcharges for system upgrades. The filing also requested an increase to the Company's return on equity from 9.7% to 10.4%. The Company also proposed a Safety Response Tracker to reconcile leak management expenses above or below the test year level on an annual basis outside of a base rate case. On August 30, 2019 Washington Gas, the Staff of the PSC of MD, the Maryland Office of People's Counsel and the Apartment & Office Building Association of Metropolitan Washington submitted a Stipulation and Settlement designed to generate an additional $27.0 million in base rates. The Stipulation stated an overall rate of return of 7.42%, established a return on equity of 9.70%, and stated a common equity ratio of 53.5% for the Company's hypothetical capital structure. The Stipulation and Settlement did not adopt the proposed Safety Response Tracker. On October\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n15, 2019 the PSC of MD issued Final Order No. 89303 which accepted the Stipulation and Settlement without change. Pursuant to Order No. 89303 Washington Gas's revised base rates went into effect for service rendered on or after October 15, 2019.\nMaryland Rate Case 2018. On May 15, 2018, Washington Gas filed an application with the PSC of MD to increase its base rates for natural gas service, generating $41.3 million in additional annual revenue. The PSC of MD granted the Company $28.6 million in new revenues and increased the Company's return on equity to 9.7%. On January 10, 2019, Washington Gas filed an application for rehearing with the PSC of MD, alleging two errors in the agency's final order. On June 25, 2019, the PSC of MD issued an order granting in part and denying in part Washington Gas' application for a rehearing, resulting in an additional $0.5 million increase in annual distribution revenues.\nMaryland Show-Cause Order. Following the NTSB hearing that examined the August 10, 2016, explosion and fire at an apartment complex in Silver Spring, Maryland, on September 5, 2019, the PSC of MD ordered the Company, within 30 days, to (i) provide a detailed response to the NTSB's probable cause findings, and (ii) provide evidence regarding the status of a 2003 mercury regulator replacement program, and if the program was not completed, to show cause why the Commission should not impose a civil penalty on the Company. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.\nVirginia Jurisdiction\nApplication for the SAVE Act Plan Rider. On September 3, 2019, Washington Gas filed with the SCC of VA an application for approval of the SAVE Plan Rider for Calendar Year 2020 of its annual adjustment of its Commission-approved SAVE Act under which the Company's 2020 SAVE Plan Rider is reconciled and adjusted. Washington Gas proposed to invest approximately $132 million over calendar year 2020 to continue work on previously approved distribution and transmission system accelerated replacement programs. Public comments were due by October 31, 2019. The SCC of VA issued an Order on November 26, 2019, approving a SAVE Rider for 2020 in the amount of approximately $13.8 million. The SAVE Rider rates approved by the Commission reflect an investment of approximately $127 million over the 12-month period beginning on January 1, 2020.\nVirginia Rate Case - 2018. On July 31, 2018, Washington Gas filed an application with the SCC of VA to increase its base rates for natural gas service by $37.6 million, which includes $14.7 million of revenue associated with natural gas pipeline replacement initiatives previously approved by the SCC of VA and paid by customers through a monthly rider. Additionally, the requested revenue increase incorporated the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). Interim rates became effective, subject to refund, for usage in the January 2019 billing cycle. On September 16, 2019, the HE issued a report that made certain recommendations, to which the Company responded on October 21, 2019. Thereafter, on December 20, 2019, the SCC of VA issued a Final Order that accepted some of the HE's findings and either rejected or made adjustments to others. The Final Order included approval of (i) an increase in base rates of $13.2 million to reflect the transfer of $101.9 million of SAVE investment from the SAVE Rider to rate base (no additional revenue increase); and (ii) amortization of unprotected plant-related and non-plant-related excess deferred income tax over 8 years.\nFor the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, Washington Gas made the following pre-tax adjustments based on the HE's recommendations and Commission's Final Order: (i) reduced Operating revenues-Utility\u201d by $7.9 million to accrue additional amounts of liability subject to refund; (ii) reduced Operating revenues-Utility\u201d by $9.0 million associated with the revised amortization of the Tax Act liability; and (iii) wrote off $2.0 million in Regulatory Assets - Other\u201d and charged to Operation and maintenance\u201d expense. Additionally, the Company reduced income tax expense by $8.5 million related to the amortization of excess deferred income tax, and recorded $5.5 million after-tax impairment of a tax regulatory asset related to flow through income taxes. The total impact from the adjustments for the calendar year 2019 was a $18.9 million reduction in \"Income before income taxes\" and a $10.9 million reductions in \"Net Income\" on Washington Gas' statements of operations.\nOn January 9, 2020, Washington Gas filed a petition for reconsideration regarding the Commission's decision to disallow recovery through base rates of the $7.1 million regulatory asset related to previously flowed through income taxes. On January 30, 2020, the Commission issued its Order on Reconsideration denying the Company's petition, and directing the Company to issue rate refunds, as well as to begin return of regulatory liabilities over a twelve-month period, within 90 days of the date of the Order on Reconsideration.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the selection and the application of appropriate technical accounting guidance to the relevant facts and circumstances of our operations, as well as our use of estimates to compile the consolidated financial statements. The application of these accounting policies involves judgment regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events, including the likelihood of success of particular regulatory initiatives, the likelihood of realizing estimates for legal and environmental contingencies, and the probability of recovering costs and investments in both the regulated utility and non-regulated business segments.\nWe have identified the following critical accounting policies discussed below that require our judgment and estimation, where the resulting estimates have a material effect on our net income.\nAccounting for Revenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized in the period in which customers obtain control of promised goods or services and performance obligations are satisfied in an amount equal to the consideration in which the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for the promised goods and services. Generally, control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customer when the natural gas is delivered to the customer.\nFor regulated deliveries of natural gas, Washington Gas reads meters and bills customers on a monthly cycle basis. The billing cycles for customers do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes. Washington Gas accrues estimated unbilled revenues for gas that has been delivered but not yet billed at the end of an accounting period by jurisdiction and customer class, including the estimated effects of billing adjustment mechanisms.\nSee Note 1 - Accounting Policies and Note 2 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.\nAccounting for Regulatory Operations-Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\nWashington Gas accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, Regulated Operations (ASC Topic 980), which results in differences in the application of GAAP between regulated and unregulated businesses.\nWashington Gas' jurisdictional tariffs contain mechanisms that provide for the recovery of the cost of gas consumed by firm customers. Under these mechanisms, Washington Gas periodically adjusts its firm customers' rates to reflect fluctuations in the cost of gas. Annually, Washington Gas reconciles the difference between the gas costs collected from firm customers and the cost of gas incurred, defers any difference and either recovers deficiencies from, or refunds excess recoveries to, customers over a period of time authorized by its regulators.\nThe current regulatory environment and Washington Gas' specific facts and circumstances support both the continued application of ASC Topic 980 for our regulatory activities and the conclusion that all of our regulatory assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 are recoverable or refundable through rates charged to customers. See Note 3 - Regulated Operations of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our regulated operations.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nWe account for contingent liabilities utilizing ASC Topic 450, Contingencies. By their nature, the amount of the contingency and the timing of a contingent event and any resulting accounting recognition are subject to our judgment of such events and our estimates of the amounts. Actual results related to contingencies may be difficult to predict and could differ significantly from the estimates included in reported earnings. For a discussion of contingencies, see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nAccounting for Derivatives\nWe enter into both physical and financial contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and apply the fair value requirements of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The financial and physical contracts that qualify as derivative instruments and are subject to the mark-to-market accounting requirements are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are recoverable or refundable to customers when they settle are subject to ASC Topic 980 and are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities while changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not affected by rate regulation are reflected in earnings.\nJudgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment for our derivative instruments, including our ability to: (i) evaluate contracts and other activities as derivative instruments subject to the accounting guidelines of ASC Topic 815; (ii) determine whether or not our derivative instruments are recoverable from or refundable to customers in future periods and\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(iii) derive the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments. See Note 14 - Derivatives of the Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our derivatives.\nAccounting for Fair Value Instruments\nFair value is based on actively quoted market prices when they are available. In the absence of actively quoted market prices, we seek indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. If pricing information from external sources is not available, internal models are used to estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and/or the use of statistical methods. These inputs are used with industry standard valuation methodologies. See Note 15 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our valuation methodologies.\nAccounting for Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nWashington Gas maintains defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans for eligible employees (the \"Plans\"). The measurement of the Plans' obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of factors, such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the Plans, earnings on the Plans' assets and mortality rates. The following assumptions are also critical to this measurement. These assumptions are derived on an annual basis with the assistance of a third-party actuarial firm:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount rate,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected long-term return on plan assets,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rate of compensation increase,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Healthcare cost trend rate and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Projected increases to the Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) plan stipend.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table illustrates the effect of changing these actuarial assumptions, while holding all other assumptions constant:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of Changing Critical Actuarial Assumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Health and Life Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>Percentage-Point\nChange in\nAssumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) in\nEnding\nObligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) in\nAnnual Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) in\nEnding\nObligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) in\nAnnual Cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term return on plan assets\n</td> <td>+/- 1.00 pt.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(7.5) / $7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(5.2) / $5.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>+/- 0.25 pt.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(33.1) / $35.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(2.7) / $2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(8.5) / $9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(0.0) / $0.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>+/- 0.25 pt.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.5 / $(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.8 / $(0.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare cost trend rate\n</td> <td>+/- 1.00 pt.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.8 / $(5.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6 / $(0.5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected increases to the HRA plan stipend\n</td> <td>+/- 1.00 pt.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$22.6 / $(18.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.8 / $(2.2)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 10 - Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional discussion of the Plans.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nIntroduction\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Management's Discussion and Analysis) analyzes the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Washington Gas. This discussion follows the format permitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2) of Form 10-K, in light of Washington Gas' status as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AltaGas as permitted under General Instruction I(1) of Form 10-K. It includes management's narrative analysis of results of operations and reasons for material changes. This narrative discusses past financial results and potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage them. Except where the content clearly indicates otherwise, Washington Gas,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the \"Company\" refers to Washington Gas Light Company.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis is designed to provide an understanding of our operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with the company's financial statements and the Notes to Financial Statements.\nExecutive Overview\nWashington Gas has one operating segment that engages in its core business of delivering and selling natural gas under tariffs approved by regulatory commissions in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. Net income was $99.8 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a net loss of $35.4 million for the same period ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income was mainly from $58.0 million increase in operating revenues driven by the impact of rate cases, accelerated pipe replacement programs and customer growth, and a $159.5 million decrease in operation and maintenance due to the lower merger commitments and related costs.\nFactors critical to the success of Washington Gas include: (i) operating a safe and reliable natural gas distribution system; (ii) having sufficient natural gas supplies to meet customer demands; (iii) being competitive with other sources of energy such as electricity, fuel oil and propane; (iv) having access to sources of liquidity; (v) recovering the costs and expenses of this business in the rates charged to customers, and (vi) earning a fair, just and reasonable rate of return on invested capital.\nResults of Operations\nOur chief operating decision maker utilizes the non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, as the primary measure of profit and loss in assessing the results of operations. We believe that our use of EBITDA enhances the ability to evaluate Washington Gas' performance because it excludes interest and income tax expense, which are affected by corporate-wide strategies of AltaGas such as capital financing. It also excludes depreciation and amortization which do not affect cash flows.\nEBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of our operating performance than, net income.\nThe following table reconciles EBITDA to net income for the calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2018 mainly driven by the impact of rate cases, accelerated pipe replacement programs, customer growth and other increases from conservation programs, recovery of various costs, and increases from interruptible and special contracts. We also utilize the non-GAAP measure of net revenues, calculated as revenues less the associated cost of energy and applicable revenue taxes, to assist in the analysis of profitability. The cost of the natural gas commodity (as adjusted for Asset Optimization sharing) and revenue taxes are included in the rates that Washington Gas charges to customers as reflected in operating revenues. Accordingly, changes in the cost of gas and revenue taxes associated with sales made to customers generally have no direct effect on utility net revenues, operating income or net income. Net revenues should not be considered an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of our operating performance than, operating revenues. Additionally, net revenues may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The table above reconciles net revenues to operating revenues for the reporting periods as part of the reconciliation of operating revenues to EBITDA. Net revenues increased by $36.2 million in the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 compared to calendar year 2018.\nThe following are the main drivers noted above for the increase in operating revenues, as well as the additional drivers for the increase in net revenues:\nImpact of rate cases. $16.2 million increase due to new base rates in Maryland, effective December 2018. Refer to Rates and Regulatory Matters\u201d for further discussion of these matters.\nAccelerated replacement programs. $11.7 million increase due to approved accelerated replacement programs that were in place with an associated surcharge mechanism to recover the cost, including a return, on those capital investments.\nCustomer growth. $6.3 million increase due to customer growth. At the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, average active customer meters increased by approximately 12,000 over the number of average active customer meters for the same period of 2018, contributing to the increase. Adding new customers directly drives earnings growth through additional distribution revenues.\nAsset optimization. $11.0 million decrease due to asset optimization. We recorded a net gain of $18.5 million including an unrealized gain of $5.4 million associated with our energy-related derivatives for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net gain of $29.5 million including an unrealized gain of $7.6 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018.\nEstimated effects of weather and consumption patterns. Weather, when measured by HDDs, was 7.9% and 2.5% warmer than normal for the calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, driving lower net revenues of $3.0 million. In the District of Columbia, where Washington Gas does not have a billing mechanism or financial instruments to offset the effects of weather, the comparatively warmer weather for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a negative variance to net revenues. Natural gas consumption patterns may be affected by shifts in weather patterns in which customer heating usage may not correlate highly with average historical levels of usage per heating degree days that occur. Natural gas consumption patterns may also be affected by non-weather related factors such as customer conservation. Refer to the section entitled \"Weather Risk\" for a discussion of billing mechanisms in Maryland and Virginia, which are designed to eliminate the net revenue effects of variations in customer usage caused by weather and other factors such as conservation.\nOther. $16.0 million increase from conservation programs, recovery of various costs, and increases from interruptible and special contracts.\nOperation and Maintenance Expenses\nOperating and maintenance expenses decreased $159.5 million in calendar year 2019 compared to calendar year 2018. The decrease was mainly driven by lower Merger commitments and related costs, offset by higher employee labor costs and benefits, corporate shared service cost paid to AltaGas after the Merger, and higher cost on safety and reliability activities including leak repair and mitigation.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe $6.2 million increase between calendar year 2019 and 2018 represented higher depreciation expense on capital additions.\nOther income (expense)\nThe $14.6 million increase in other income (expenses) for the calendar year 2019 compared to the calendar year 2018 was mainly driven by $13.5 million expense for charitable contributions as part of the Merger commitments that were recorded in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate for calendar year 2019 was 16.0% compared to 54.8% for calendar year 2018. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to adjustments related to the amortization of excess deferred taxes.

Washington Gas' rates are based on an assumption of normal weather. The tariffs in the Maryland and Virginia jurisdictions include provisions that consider the effects of the RNA and the WNA/CRA mechanisms, respectively, that are designed to, among other things, eliminate the effect on net revenues of variations in weather from normal levels (refer to the section entitled Weather Risk\u201d for a further discussion of these mechanisms and other weather-related instruments included in our weather protection strategy).\nDuring the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, the comparison in natural gas deliveries to firm customers primarily reflects 7.9% warmer than normal weather when measured by HDDs, compared to 2.5% warmer than normal weather for the prior year. We also had an increase in average active customer meters of approximately 12,000 during the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the prior year.\nMany customers choose to buy the natural gas commodity from unregulated third-party marketers, rather than purchase the natural gas commodity and delivery service from Washington Gas on a bundled basis. This does not affect Washington Gas' net income because Washington Gas charges its customers the cost of gas without any mark-up. Of Washington Gas' 1.2 million\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nactive customers at December 31, 2019, approximately 171,000 customers purchased their natural gas commodity from unregulated third-party marketers.\nGas Service to Interruptible Customers\nWashington Gas must curtail or interrupt service to this class of customer when the demand by firm customers exceeds specified levels. Therm deliveries to interruptible customers increased by 13.9 million therms during the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased demand in 2019.\nIn the District of Columbia, the effect on net income of any changes in delivered volumes and prices to interruptible customers is limited by margin-sharing arrangements that are included in Washington Gas' firm rate designs. Rates for interruptible customers in Maryland and Virginia are based on a traditional cost of service approach. In Virginia, Washington Gas retains a majority of the margins earned on interruptible gas and delivery sales. Washington Gas shares actual non-gas margins from interruptible sales service customers that are in excess of delivery service rates. In Maryland, Washington Gas retains a defined amount of revenues based on a set threshold. Effective December 2018, Washington Gas no longer shares interruptible margins in Maryland.\nGas Service for Electric Generation\nWashington Gas delivers natural gas for use at two electric generation facilities in Maryland that are each owned by companies independent of WGL. During the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, deliveries to these customers decreased by 105.8 million therms from the calendar year 2018. Washington Gas shares with firm customers a significant majority of the margins earned from natural gas deliveries to these customers. Therefore, changes in the volume of interruptible gas deliveries to these customers do not materially affect either net revenues or net income.\nCost of Gas\nWashington Gas' cost of natural gas purchased includes both fixed and variable components. Washington Gas pays fixed costs or demand charges\u201d to pipeline companies for system capacity needed to transport and store natural gas. Washington Gas pays variable costs, or the cost of the natural gas commodity itself, to natural gas producers and suppliers. Variations in the utility's cost of gas expense result from changes in gas sales volumes, the price of the gas purchased and the level of gas costs collected through the operation of firm gas cost recovery mechanisms. Under these regulated recovery mechanisms, Washington Gas records cost of gas expense equal to the cost of gas recovered from customers and included in revenues. The difference between the firm gas costs incurred and the gas costs recovered from customers is deferred on the balance sheet as an amount to be collected from or refunded to customers in future periods. Therefore, increases or decreases in the cost of gas associated with sales made to firm customers have no direct effect on Washington Gas' net revenues and net income. Changes in the cost of gas can cause significant variations in Washington Gas' cash provided by or used in operating activities. Washington Gas receives from or pays to its customers in the District of Columbia and Virginia, carrying costs associated with under-collected or over-collected gas costs recovered from its customers using short-term interest rates. Additionally, included in Utility cost of gas\u201d for Washington Gas are the net margins associated with our asset optimization program. To the extent these amounts are shared with customers, they are a reduction to the cost of gas invoiced to customers. Refer to the section entitled Market Risk\u201d for a further discussion of Washington Gas' optimization program.\nThe average commodity cost of gas invoiced to Washington Gas (excluding the cost and related volumes applicable to asset optimization) were $0.28, $0.37, $0.30, and $0.27 per therm for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, three months ended December 31, 2018, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral Factors Affecting Liquidity\nWashington Gas generally meets its liquidity and capital needs through cash on hand, retained earnings, the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, and equity infusions from its parent holding companies, routed through Wrangler. Access to short-term debt markets is necessary for funding our short-term liquidity requirements, the most significant of which include buying natural gas and pipeline capacity, and financing both accounts receivable and storage gas inventory. We have accessed long-term capital markets primarily to fund capital expenditures and retire long-term debt. Under the Merger commitments agreed to by AltaGas and Washington Gas during the Merger and other rules imposed by regulatory commissions or laws in Washington Gas' service territory, the Company is prohibited and/or restricted in its ability to make advances or issue loans to an affiliate or parent holding company without prior regulatory commission approval.\nOur plans provide sufficient liquidity to satisfy our financial obligations. Generally, pursuant to its Merger commitments, Washington Gas can make dividend payments in the ordinary course of business unless any of the following regulatory\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nlimitations apply: (i) Washington Gas will not pay extraordinary dividends to its parent for three years from the date of the Merger close, (ii) Washington Gas will not pay dividends to its parent company if Washington Gas' senior unsecured debt rating is below investment grade or (iii) Washington Gas will not make a dividend payment to its parent company if the payment would result in its equity level to drop below 48%. At December 31, 2019, we had no significant restrictions on our cash balances or retained earnings that would affect the payment of dividends.\nShort-Term Cash Requirements and Related Financing\nWashington Gas has seasonal short-term cash requirements to fund the purchase of storage gas inventory in advance of the winter heating season. The Company collects the cost of gas under cost recovery mechanisms approved by our regulators.\nIn the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year, Washington Gas' large sales volumes cause its cash requirements to peak when combined storage inventory, accounts receivable, and unbilled revenues are at their highest levels. In the second and third quarters of each calendar year, after the heating season, Washington Gas typically experiences a seasonal net loss due to reduced demand for natural gas. During this period, large amounts of Washington Gas' current assets are converted to cash.\nWashington Gas uses short-term debt in the form of commercial paper or unsecured short-term bank loans to fund seasonal cash requirements. Our policy is to maintain back-up bank credit facilities in an amount equal to or greater than our expected maximum commercial paper position. In December 2019, we classified $100.0 million commercial paper balance as \"Long-term debt\" on Washington Gas' balance sheets due to its ability and intent to refinance these balances on a long-term basis.\nOn July 19, 2019, Washington Gas entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a term of five years, plus two one-year extension options, available with the bank group's approval (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility amended and restated Washington Gas' prior $350 million credit facility and permits Washington Gas to borrow up to $450 million with an option to increase the facility by an additional $100 million with the bank group's approval, for a total potential maximum borrowing of $550 million. The interest rate of loans made under the credit facilities will be a fluctuating rate per annum that will be set using certain parameters at the time each loan is made. Bank credit balances available to Washington Gas under the existing credit facility, net of commercial paper balances were $50.0 million and $54.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLong-Term Cash Requirements and Related Financing\nThe primary drivers of our long-term cash requirements are capital expenditures and long-term debt maturities. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to adding new utility customers and system supply and maintaining the safety and reliability of Washington Gas' distribution system.\nSecurity Ratings\nOn December 11, 2019, Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P) revised its outlook on AltaGas from negative to stable, and raised the senior unsecured debt credit rating for Washington Gas from BBB+ to A- and its outlook from negative to stable. Washington Gas has ring fencing measures in place that financially separate Washington Gas from WGL, AltaGas and its affiliates as a way to protect its consumers from financial instability or bankruptcy that may be experienced by Washington Gas' parents or affiliates. S&P views the ring-fencing provisions sufficient to insulate Washington Gas from AltaGas and its other subsidiaries to warrant three-notches of ratings separation between Washington Gas and AltaGas. The credit rating for Washington Gas' commercial paper remained at A-2.\nOn January 30, 2020, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) downgraded the ratings of Washington Gas' senior unsecured debt credit rating to A3 from A2 and its commercial paper rating to P-2 from P-1. The outlook for Washington Gas is stable. Moody's affirmed the ratings of WGL's Baa1 for senior unsecured rating and P-2 commercial paper rating and changed its outlook to stable from negative.\nThe table below reflects the credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of Washington Gas as of December 31, 2019.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nUnder the terms of Washington Gas' revolving credit agreements and private placement notes, the ratio of consolidated financial indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0 (65.0%). At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Washington Gas' ratios of consolidated financial indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization were 52% and 47%, respectively. In addition, Washington Gas is required to inform lenders of changes in corporate existence, financial conditions, litigation and environmental warranties that might have a material effect on debt ratings. The failure to inform the lenders' agent of material changes in these areas might constitute default under the agreements. Additionally, failure to pay principal or interest on any other indebtedness may be deemed a default under our credit agreements. A default, if not remedied, may lead to a suspension of further loans and/or acceleration in which obligations become immediately due and payable. In addition, certain of the credit facilities of Washington Gas contain cross-default provisions. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our revolving credit facilities, term loan facility, and private placement notes.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes Washington Gas' net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Calendar Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n(Unaudited)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n(Unaudited)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>Calendar year\n</td> <td>Three Months\n</td> <td>Fiscal year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\nvs. 2018\n</td> <td>2018\nvs. 2017\n</td> <td>2018\nvs. 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(94.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(85.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>448.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>226.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(229.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(433.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(440.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(126.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(75.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(389.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(403.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nWashington Gas' cash flows from operating activities principally reflect gas sales and deliveries and the cost of operations. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $203.3 million for the calendar year 2019, a $147.0 million increase from calendar year 2018. The increase was mainly driven by decreased cash payments for Merger commitments and related costs due to the Merger in 2018.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities was $219.4 million in the calendar year 2019 compared to $448.8 million in 2018. The $219.4 million cash flows from financing activities in 2019 was mainly driven by $298.5 million proceeds from issuance of medium-term note in September 2019, $103.5 million net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, offset by $50.0 million long-term debt repayment and $100.7 million in dividend payments on preferred and common stocks. Additionally, we paid $28.7 million to redeem three outstanding series of preferred stock in December 2019. The $448.8 million cash flows from financing activities in 2018 was mainly driven by $402.7 million capital infusion from our parent company, $134.0 million net proceeds from short-term borrowings, offset by $50 million long-term debt repayment and $90.8 million dividend payments on preferred and common stocks in 2018.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7.

APRPs are in place in all three of our jurisdictions. Washington Gas is accelerating pipe replacement in order to reduce risk and further enhance the safety and reliability of the pipeline system. Each regulatory commission having jurisdiction over Washington Gas' retail rates has APRPs with an associated surcharge mechanism to recover the cost, including a return, on those capital investments between base rate cases. In contrast to the traditional rate-making approach to capital investments, for the APRPs, Washington Gas is receiving recovery for these investments through the approved surcharges for each program and is authorized to invest in each of these programs over a five-year period.

At December 31, 2019, the cumulative amount of merger commitments that has been expensed was $136.6 million, of which $17.0 million has not been paid. In addition, there are certain regulatory commitments that were and will be expensed as the costs are incurred, including the hiring of damage prevention trainers in each jurisdiction for a total of $2.4 million over 5 years; investing up to $70.0 million over a 10 year period to further extend natural gas service; and spending $8.0 million for leak mitigation within 3 years after the Merger close.\nThe table above reflects fixed and variable obligations. Certain of these estimates reflect likely purchases under various contracts and may differ from minimum future contractual commitments disclosed in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nFor commitments related to Washington Gas' pension and post-retirement benefit plans, refer to Note 10 - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk\nWholesale Credit Risk\nWashington Gas enters into transactions with wholesale counterparties for the purpose of meeting firm ratepayer commitments, to optimize the value of its long-term capacity assets, and for hedging natural gas costs. Certain wholesale suppliers that sell natural gas to Washington Gas may have relatively low credit ratings or may not be rated by major credit rating agencies. In the event of a counterparty's failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas or fulfill its payment obligations, Washington Gas may incur losses that would typically be passed through to its sales customers under the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; however, Washington Gas may be at risk for financial loss to the extent these losses are not passed through to its customers.\nWashington Gas operates under an existing wholesale counterparty credit policy that is designed to mitigate credit risks through requirements for credit enhancements including, but not limited to, letters of credit, parent guarantees and cash collateral when deemed necessary. In accordance with this policy, Washington Gas has obtained credit enhancements from certain of its counterparties. If certain counterparties or their guarantors meet the policy's creditworthiness criteria, Washington Gas may grant unsecured credit to those counterparties or their guarantors. The creditworthiness of all counterparties is continuously monitored.\nThe following table provides information on our credit exposure, net of collateral, to wholesale counterparties as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Exposure to Wholesale Counterparties (In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating(a)\n</td> <td>Exposure\nBefore Credit\nCollateral(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Offsetting Credit\nCollateral Held(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nExposure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nCounterparties\nGreater Than\n10%(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Exposure of\nCounterparties\nGreater Than 10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Grade\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Investment Grade\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>No External Ratings\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Investment grade is primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty. If the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher-rated entity (e.g., its parent), it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor. Included in Investment grade\u201d are counterparties with a minimum Standard & Poor's or Moody's Investor Service rating of BBB- or Baa3, respectively.\n(b) Includes the net of all open positions on energy-related derivatives subject to mark-to-market accounting requirements and the net receivable/payable for the realized transactions.

To manage this customer credit risk, Washington Gas may require cash deposits from high risk customers to cover payment of their bills until the requirements for the deposit refunds are met. Base rates include a provision for recovery of uncollectible accounts based on historical levels of charge offs of accounts receivable. Washington Gas also has a provision in its Gas Administrative Charge mechanism that includes an\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nallowance for commodity amounts included in uncollectible accounts. In addition, Washington Gas has a POR program in Maryland and the District of Columbia, whereby it purchases receivables from participating energy marketers at approved discount rates, which incorporates the risk of non-payment by the retail customers for these receivables.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity price risk, weather risk and interest-rate risk. The following discussion describes these risks and our management of them.\nPrice Risk\nWashington Gas faces price risk associated with the purchase and sale of natural gas. Washington Gas generally recovers the cost of the natural gas to serve customers through gas cost recovery mechanisms as approved in jurisdictional tariffs; therefore, a change in the price of natural gas generally has no direct effect on Washington Gas' net income. However, Washington Gas is responsible for following competitive and reasonable practices in purchasing natural gas for its customers.\nTo manage price risk associated with its natural gas supply to its firm customers, Washington Gas: (i) actively manages its gas supply portfolio to balance sales and delivery obligations; (ii) injects natural gas into storage during the summer months when prices are generally lower, and withdraws that gas during the winter heating season when prices are generally higher and (iii) enters into hedging contracts and other contracts that may qualify as derivative instruments related to the sale and purchase of natural gas.\nWashington Gas executes commodity-related physical and financial contracts in the form of forward, futures and option contracts as part of an asset optimization program that is managed by its internal staff. Under this program, Washington Gas realizes value from its long-term natural gas transportation and storage capacity resources when they are not being fully used to serve utility customers. Regulatory sharing mechanisms in all three jurisdictions allow the profit from these transactions to be shared between Washington Gas' customers and shareholders.\nThe following two tables summarize the changes in the fair value of our net assets (liabilities) associated with the energy-related derivatives during the calendar year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in Fair Value of Energy-Related Derivatives\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets (liabilities) at January 1, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(106.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net fair value of contracts entered into during the period\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other changes in net fair value\n</td> <td>27.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized net settlement of derivatives\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(91.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\nRoll Forward of Energy-Related Derivatives\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets (liabilities) at January 1, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(106.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recorded to income\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recorded to regulatory assets/liabilities\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized net settlement of derivatives\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(91.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe maturity dates in calendar years of our net assets (liabilities) associated with the energy-related derivatives recorded at fair value at December 31, 2019, is summarized in the following table based on the level of the fair value calculation under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7.

Weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered by Washington Gas. Weather patterns tend to be more volatile during shoulder\u201d months within our calendar year in which Washington Gas is going into or coming out of the winter heating season. During the shoulder months within quarters ending June 30 (particularly in April and May) and December 31 (particularly in October and November), customer heating usage may not highly correlate with historical levels or with the level of heating degree days that occur, particularly when weather patterns experienced are not consistently cold or warm.\nWashington Gas does not have a weather related instrument or billing adjustment mechanism in the District of Columbia and as a result, its revenues are volume driven and current rates are based upon an assumption of normal weather. Without weather protection strategies, variations from normal weather will cause our earnings to increase or decrease depending on the weather pattern.\nBilling Adjustment Mechanisms. In Maryland, Washington Gas has an RNA billing mechanism that is designed to stabilize the level of net revenues collected from Maryland customers by eliminating the effect of deviations in customer usage caused by variations in weather from normal levels and other factors such as conservation. In Virginia, Washington Gas has a WNA billing adjustment mechanism that is designed to eliminate the effect of variations in weather from normal levels on utility net revenues for residential, commercial and industrial and group metered apartment customers. Additionally, in Virginia, as part of the CARE plan, Washington Gas has a CRA mechanism that eliminates the effect of conservation for residential customers.\nInterest-Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest-rate risk associated with our short-term and long-term financing. Washington Gas has previously utilized derivative instruments in order to reduce its exposure to the risk of interest-rate volatility, with resulting gains and losses typically being recovered through each jurisdiction's overall allowed rate of return.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, Washington Gas had outstanding commercial paper and project financing of $399.5 million and $311.5 million, respectively. The carrying amount of commercial paper and project financing approximates their fair value. At December 31, 2019, a change of 100 basis points in the underlying average interest rate for our commercial paper would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately $2.3 million.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, Washington Gas had outstanding fixed-rate MTNs and other long-term debt of $1,330.9 million and $1,035.0 million, respectively, excluding current maturities and commercial paper. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of Washington Gas' fixed-rate debt was $1,480.8 million. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that fair value would increase by approximately $77.3 million or decrease by approximately $71.6 million if interest rates were to decline or increase by 10%, respectively, from current market levels. In general, such an increase or decrease in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if Washington Gas were to reacquire some or all of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity.\nAt December 31, 2019, a total of $1,202.5 million, or approximately 89.3% of the face amount of Washington Gas' outstanding long-term debt, excluding current maturities and commercial paper, have make-whole call options which would require us to pay a premium over the face amount if we were to exercise them.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7.

Refer to the section \"Accelerated Pipe Replacement Programs\" above for a discussion of regulatory matters associated with those programs.\nDistrict of Columbia Jurisdiction\nPROJECTpipes 2 Plan. On December 7, 2018, Washington Gas filed a request with the PSC of DC for approval of the PROJECTpipes 2 Plan, the second phase of Washington Gas' APRP, to cover the period from October 1, 2019 through December 31, 2024. The PROJECTpipes 2 Plan seeks to address relatively higher risk pipe associated with an aging infrastructure by replacing pipe materials and components, as well as adding new features to enhance the safety of Washington Gas' system, with an estimated total cost of $305.3 million. On September 5, 2019, the PSC of DC issued an order extending the original PROJECTpipes an additional six months through March 31, 2020, in an amount not to exceed $12.5 million. On September 13, 2019, Washington Gas submitted a revised five year final annual project list. The parties are engaged in settlement negotiations, as directed by the PSC of DC. On February 14, 2020, a final settlement conference report was submitted, and the PSC of DC continues to review the PROJECTpipes 2 Plan.\nDistrict of Columbia 2020 Rate Case. On January 13, 2020, Washington Gas filed an application for authority to increase charges for gas service in the District of Columbia. The requested rates are designed to collect approximately $35.2 million in total annual revenues. Of the approximate $35.2 million revenue increase requested, $9.1 million represents costs collected through the PROJECTpipes surcharge; therefore, the incremental amount of the base rate increase is approximately $26.1 million. The Company requests that new rates be implemented by January 1, 2021.\nMaryland Jurisdiction\nMaryland Rate Case 2019. On April 22, 2019, Washington Gas filed an application with the PSC of MD to increase its base rates for natural gas service, generating $30.8 million in additional annual revenue. The revenue increase represented an increase in base rates of $35.9 million, of which approximately $5.0 million relates to costs being collected through the monthly STRIDE surcharges for system upgrades. The filing also requested an increase to the Company's return on equity from 9.7% to 10.4%. The Company also proposed a Safety Response Tracker to reconcile leak management expenses above or below the test year level on an annual basis outside of a base rate case. On August 30, 2019 Washington Gas, the Staff of the PSC of MD, the Maryland Office of People's Counsel and the Apartment & Office Building Association of Metropolitan Washington submitted a Stipulation and Settlement designed to generate an additional $27.0 million in base rates. The Stipulation stated an overall rate of return of 7.42%, established a return on equity of 9.70%, and stated a common equity ratio of 53.5% for the Company's hypothetical capital structure. The Stipulation and Settlement did not adopt the proposed Safety Response Tracker. On October\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n15, 2019 the PSC of MD issued Final Order No. 89303 which accepted the Stipulation and Settlement without change. Pursuant to Order No. 89303 Washington Gas's revised base rates went into effect for service rendered on or after October 15, 2019.\nMaryland Rate Case 2018. On May 15, 2018, Washington Gas filed an application with the PSC of MD to increase its base rates for natural gas service, generating $41.3 million in additional annual revenue. The PSC of MD granted the Company $28.6 million in new revenues and increased the Company's return on equity to 9.7%. On January 10, 2019, Washington Gas filed an application for rehearing with the PSC of MD, alleging two errors in the agency's final order. On June 25, 2019, the PSC of MD issued an order granting in part and denying in part Washington Gas' application for a rehearing, resulting in an additional $0.5 million increase in annual distribution revenues.\nMaryland Show-Cause Order. Following the NTSB hearing that examined the August 10, 2016, explosion and fire at an apartment complex in Silver Spring, Maryland, on September 5, 2019, the PSC of MD ordered the Company, within 30 days, to (i) provide a detailed response to the NTSB's probable cause findings, and (ii) provide evidence regarding the status of a 2003 mercury regulator replacement program, and if the program was not completed, to show cause why the Commission should not impose a civil penalty on the Company. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.\nVirginia Jurisdiction\nApplication for the SAVE Act Plan Rider. On September 3, 2019, Washington Gas filed with the SCC of VA an application for approval of the SAVE Plan Rider for Calendar Year 2020 of its annual adjustment of its Commission-approved SAVE Act under which the Company's 2020 SAVE Plan Rider is reconciled and adjusted. Washington Gas proposed to invest approximately $132 million over calendar year 2020 to continue work on previously approved distribution and transmission system accelerated replacement programs. Public comments were due by October 31, 2019. The SCC of VA issued an Order on November 26, 2019, approving a SAVE Rider for 2020 in the amount of approximately $13.8 million. The SAVE Rider rates approved by the Commission reflect an investment of approximately $127 million over the 12-month period beginning on January 1, 2020.\nVirginia Rate Case - 2018. On July 31, 2018, Washington Gas filed an application with the SCC of VA to increase its base rates for natural gas service by $37.6 million, which includes $14.7 million of revenue associated with natural gas pipeline replacement initiatives previously approved by the SCC of VA and paid by customers through a monthly rider. Additionally, the requested revenue increase incorporated the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). Interim rates became effective, subject to refund, for usage in the January 2019 billing cycle. On September 16, 2019, the HE issued a report that made certain recommendations, to which the Company responded on October 21, 2019. Thereafter, on December 20, 2019, the SCC of VA issued a Final Order that accepted some of the HE's findings and either rejected or made adjustments to others. The Final Order included approval of (i) an increase in base rates of $13.2 million to reflect the transfer of $101.9 million of SAVE investment from the SAVE Rider to rate base (no additional revenue increase); and (ii) amortization of unprotected plant-related and non-plant-related excess deferred income tax over 8 years.\nFor the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, Washington Gas made the following pre-tax adjustments based on the HE's recommendations and Commission's Final Order: (i) reduced Operating revenues-Utility\u201d by $7.9 million to accrue additional amounts of liability subject to refund; (ii) reduced Operating revenues-Utility\u201d by $9.0 million associated with the revised amortization of the Tax Act liability; and (iii) wrote off $2.0 million in Regulatory Assets - Other\u201d and charged to Operation and maintenance\u201d expense. Additionally, the Company reduced income tax expense by $8.5 million related to the amortization of excess deferred income tax, and recorded $5.5 million after-tax impairment of a tax regulatory asset related to flow through income taxes. The total impact from the adjustments for the calendar year 2019 was a $18.9 million reduction in \"Income before income taxes\" and a $10.9 million reductions in \"Net Income\" on Washington Gas' statements of operations.\nOn January 9, 2020, Washington Gas filed a petition for reconsideration regarding the Commission's decision to disallow recovery through base rates of the $7.1 million regulatory asset related to previously flowed through income taxes. On January 30, 2020, the Commission issued its Order on Reconsideration denying the Company's petition, and directing the Company to issue rate refunds, as well as to begin return of regulatory liabilities over a twelve-month period, within 90 days of the date of the Order on Reconsideration.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the selection and the application of appropriate technical accounting guidance to the relevant facts and circumstances of our operations, as well as our use of estimates to compile the consolidated financial statements. The application of these accounting policies involves judgment regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events, including the likelihood of success of particular regulatory initiatives, the likelihood of realizing estimates for legal and environmental contingencies, and the probability of recovering costs and investments in both the regulated utility and non-regulated business segments.\nWe have identified the following critical accounting policies discussed below that require our judgment and estimation, where the resulting estimates have a material effect on our net income.\nAccounting for Revenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized in the period in which customers obtain control of promised goods or services and performance obligations are satisfied in an amount equal to the consideration in which the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for the promised goods and services. Generally, control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customer when the natural gas is delivered to the customer.\nFor regulated deliveries of natural gas, Washington Gas reads meters and bills customers on a monthly cycle basis. The billing cycles for customers do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes. Washington Gas accrues estimated unbilled revenues for gas that has been delivered but not yet billed at the end of an accounting period by jurisdiction and customer class, including the estimated effects of billing adjustment mechanisms.\nSee Note 1 - Accounting Policies and Note 2 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.\nAccounting for Regulatory Operations-Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\nWashington Gas accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, Regulated Operations (ASC Topic 980), which results in differences in the application of GAAP between regulated and unregulated businesses.\nWashington Gas' jurisdictional tariffs contain mechanisms that provide for the recovery of the cost of gas consumed by firm customers. Under these mechanisms, Washington Gas periodically adjusts its firm customers' rates to reflect fluctuations in the cost of gas. Annually, Washington Gas reconciles the difference between the gas costs collected from firm customers and the cost of gas incurred, defers any difference and either recovers deficiencies from, or refunds excess recoveries to, customers over a period of time authorized by its regulators.\nThe current regulatory environment and Washington Gas' specific facts and circumstances support both the continued application of ASC Topic 980 for our regulatory activities and the conclusion that all of our regulatory assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 are recoverable or refundable through rates charged to customers. See Note 3 - Regulated Operations of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our regulated operations.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nWe account for contingent liabilities utilizing ASC Topic 450, Contingencies. By their nature, the amount of the contingency and the timing of a contingent event and any resulting accounting recognition are subject to our judgment of such events and our estimates of the amounts. Actual results related to contingencies may be difficult to predict and could differ significantly from the estimates included in reported earnings. For a discussion of contingencies, see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nAccounting for Derivatives\nWe enter into both physical and financial contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and apply the fair value requirements of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The financial and physical contracts that qualify as derivative instruments and are subject to the mark-to-market accounting requirements are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are recoverable or refundable to customers when they settle are subject to ASC Topic 980 and are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities while changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not affected by rate regulation are reflected in earnings.\nJudgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment for our derivative instruments, including our ability to: (i) evaluate contracts and other activities as derivative instruments subject to the accounting guidelines of ASC Topic 815; (ii) determine whether or not our derivative instruments are recoverable from or refundable to customers in future periods and\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(iii) derive the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments. See Note 14 - Derivatives of the Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our derivatives.\nAccounting for Fair Value Instruments\nFair value is based on actively quoted market prices when they are available. In the absence of actively quoted market prices, we seek indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. If pricing information from external sources is not available, internal models are used to estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and/or the use of statistical methods. These inputs are used with industry standard valuation methodologies. See Note 15 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our valuation methodologies.\nAccounting for Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nWashington Gas maintains defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans for eligible employees (the \"Plans\"). The measurement of the Plans' obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of factors, such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the Plans, earnings on the Plans' assets and mortality rates. The following assumptions are also critical to this measurement. These assumptions are derived on an annual basis with the assistance of a third-party actuarial firm:\n \u2022 Discount rate, \n \u2022 Expected long-term return on plan assets, \n \u2022 Rate of compensation increase, \n \u2022 Healthcare cost trend rate and \n \u2022 Projected increases to the Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) plan stipend. \nThe following table illustrates the effect of changing these actuarial assumptions, while holding all other assumptions constant:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of Changing Critical Actuarial Assumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Health and Life Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>Percentage-Point\nChange in\nAssumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) in\nEnding\nObligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) in\nAnnual Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) in\nEnding\nObligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease) in\nAnnual Cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term return on plan assets\n</td> <td>+/- 1.00 pt.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(7.5) / $7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(5.2) / $5.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>+/- 0.25 pt.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(33.1) / $35.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(2.7) / $2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(8.5) / $9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(0.0) / $0.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>+/- 0.25 pt.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.5 / $(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.8 / $(0.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare cost trend rate\n</td> <td>+/- 1.00 pt.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5.8 / $(5.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$0.6 / $(0.5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected increases to the HRA plan stipend\n</td> <td>+/- 1.00 pt.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$22.6 / $(18.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2.8 / $(2.2)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 10 - Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional discussion of the Plans.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nIntroduction\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Management's Discussion and Analysis) analyzes the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Washington Gas. This discussion follows the format permitted in accordance with General Instruction I(2) of Form 10-K, in light of Washington Gas' status as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AltaGas as permitted under General Instruction I(1) of Form 10-K. It includes management's narrative analysis of results of operations and reasons for material changes. This narrative discusses past financial results and potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage them. Except where the content clearly indicates otherwise, Washington Gas,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the \"Company\" refers to Washington Gas Light Company.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis is designed to provide an understanding of our operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with the company's financial statements and the Notes to Financial Statements.\nExecutive Overview\nWashington Gas has one operating segment that engages in its core business of delivering and selling natural gas under tariffs approved by regulatory commissions in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. Net income was $99.8 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a net loss of $35.4 million for the same period ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income was mainly from $58.0 million increase in operating revenues driven by the impact of rate cases, accelerated pipe replacement programs and customer growth, and a $159.5 million decrease in operation and maintenance due to the lower merger commitments and related costs.\nFactors critical to the success of Washington Gas include: (i) operating a safe and reliable natural gas distribution system; (ii) having sufficient natural gas supplies to meet customer demands; (iii) being competitive with other sources of energy such as electricity, fuel oil and propane; (iv) having access to sources of liquidity; (v) recovering the costs and expenses of this business in the rates charged to customers, and (vi) earning a fair, just and reasonable rate of return on invested capital.\nResults of Operations\nOur chief operating decision maker utilizes the non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, as the primary measure of profit and loss in assessing the results of operations. We believe that our use of EBITDA enhances the ability to evaluate Washington Gas' performance because it excludes interest and income tax expense, which are affected by corporate-wide strategies of AltaGas such as capital financing. It also excludes depreciation and amortization which do not affect cash flows.\nEBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of our operating performance than, net income.\nThe following table reconciles EBITDA to net income for the calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.\n\nSummary Financial Results\nThe following table summarizes the Company's financial data for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.\n\nRevenues\nOperating revenues increased by $58.0 million in the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 compared to calendar year 2018 mainly driven by the impact of rate cases, accelerated pipe replacement programs, customer growth and other increases from conservation programs, recovery of various costs, and increases from interruptible and special contracts. We also utilize the non-GAAP measure of net revenues, calculated as revenues less the associated cost of energy and applicable revenue taxes, to assist in the analysis of profitability. The cost of the natural gas commodity (as adjusted for Asset Optimization sharing) and revenue taxes are included in the rates that Washington Gas charges to customers as reflected in operating revenues. Accordingly, changes in the cost of gas and revenue taxes associated with sales made to customers generally have no direct effect on utility net revenues, operating income or net income. Net revenues should not be considered an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of our operating performance than, operating revenues. Additionally, net revenues may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The table above reconciles net revenues to operating revenues for the reporting periods as part of the reconciliation of operating revenues to EBITDA. Net revenues increased by $36.2 million in the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 compared to calendar year 2018.\nThe following are the main drivers noted above for the increase in operating revenues, as well as the additional drivers for the increase in net revenues:\nImpact of rate cases. $16.2 million increase due to new base rates in Maryland, effective December 2018. Refer to Rates and Regulatory Matters\u201d for further discussion of these matters.\nAccelerated replacement programs. $11.7 million increase due to approved accelerated replacement programs that were in place with an associated surcharge mechanism to recover the cost, including a return, on those capital investments.\nCustomer growth. $6.3 million increase due to customer growth. At the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, average active customer meters increased by approximately 12,000 over the number of average active customer meters for the same period of 2018, contributing to the increase. Adding new customers directly drives earnings growth through additional distribution revenues.\nAsset optimization. $11.0 million decrease due to asset optimization. We recorded a net gain of $18.5 million including an unrealized gain of $5.4 million associated with our energy-related derivatives for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net gain of $29.5 million including an unrealized gain of $7.6 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018.\nEstimated effects of weather and consumption patterns. Weather, when measured by HDDs, was 7.9% and 2.5% warmer than normal for the calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, driving lower net revenues of $3.0 million. In the District of Columbia, where Washington Gas does not have a billing mechanism or financial instruments to offset the effects of weather, the comparatively warmer weather for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a negative variance to net revenues. Natural gas consumption patterns may be affected by shifts in weather patterns in which customer heating usage may not correlate highly with average historical levels of usage per heating degree days that occur. Natural gas consumption patterns may also be affected by non-weather related factors such as customer conservation. Refer to the section entitled \"Weather Risk\" for a discussion of billing mechanisms in Maryland and Virginia, which are designed to eliminate the net revenue effects of variations in customer usage caused by weather and other factors such as conservation.\nOther. $16.0 million increase from conservation programs, recovery of various costs, and increases from interruptible and special contracts.\nOperation and Maintenance Expenses\nOperating and maintenance expenses decreased $159.5 million in calendar year 2019 compared to calendar year 2018. The decrease was mainly driven by lower Merger commitments and related costs, offset by higher employee labor costs and benefits, corporate shared service cost paid to AltaGas after the Merger, and higher cost on safety and reliability activities including leak repair and mitigation.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe $6.2 million increase between calendar year 2019 and 2018 represented higher depreciation expense on capital additions.\nOther income (expense)\nThe $14.6 million increase in other income (expenses) for the calendar year 2019 compared to the calendar year 2018 was mainly driven by $13.5 million expense for charitable contributions as part of the Merger commitments that were recorded in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate for calendar year 2019 was 16.0% compared to 54.8% for calendar year 2018. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to adjustments related to the amortization of excess deferred taxes. Refer to Note 9 - Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements for details.\nStatistical Information\nKey gas delivery, weather and meter statistics are shown in the table below for the calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.\n\nGas Service to Firm Customers\nThe volume of gas delivered to firm customers is highly sensitive to weather variability as a large portion of the natural gas delivered by Washington Gas is used for space heating. Washington Gas' rates are based on an assumption of normal weather. The tariffs in the Maryland and Virginia jurisdictions include provisions that consider the effects of the RNA and the WNA/CRA mechanisms, respectively, that are designed to, among other things, eliminate the effect on net revenues of variations in weather from normal levels (refer to the section entitled Weather Risk\u201d for a further discussion of these mechanisms and other weather-related instruments included in our weather protection strategy).\nDuring the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, the comparison in natural gas deliveries to firm customers primarily reflects 7.9% warmer than normal weather when measured by HDDs, compared to 2.5% warmer than normal weather for the prior year. We also had an increase in average active customer meters of approximately 12,000 during the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the prior year.\nMany customers choose to buy the natural gas commodity from unregulated third-party marketers, rather than purchase the natural gas commodity and delivery service from Washington Gas on a bundled basis. This does not affect Washington Gas' net income because Washington Gas charges its customers the cost of gas without any mark-up. Of Washington Gas' 1.2 million\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nactive customers at December 31, 2019, approximately 171,000 customers purchased their natural gas commodity from unregulated third-party marketers.\nGas Service to Interruptible Customers\nWashington Gas must curtail or interrupt service to this class of customer when the demand by firm customers exceeds specified levels. Therm deliveries to interruptible customers increased by 13.9 million therms during the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased demand in 2019.\nIn the District of Columbia, the effect on net income of any changes in delivered volumes and prices to interruptible customers is limited by margin-sharing arrangements that are included in Washington Gas' firm rate designs. Rates for interruptible customers in Maryland and Virginia are based on a traditional cost of service approach. In Virginia, Washington Gas retains a majority of the margins earned on interruptible gas and delivery sales. Washington Gas shares actual non-gas margins from interruptible sales service customers that are in excess of delivery service rates. In Maryland, Washington Gas retains a defined amount of revenues based on a set threshold. Effective December 2018, Washington Gas no longer shares interruptible margins in Maryland.\nGas Service for Electric Generation\nWashington Gas delivers natural gas for use at two electric generation facilities in Maryland that are each owned by companies independent of WGL. During the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, deliveries to these customers decreased by 105.8 million therms from the calendar year 2018. Washington Gas shares with firm customers a significant majority of the margins earned from natural gas deliveries to these customers. Therefore, changes in the volume of interruptible gas deliveries to these customers do not materially affect either net revenues or net income.\nCost of Gas\nWashington Gas' cost of natural gas purchased includes both fixed and variable components. Washington Gas pays fixed costs or demand charges\u201d to pipeline companies for system capacity needed to transport and store natural gas. Washington Gas pays variable costs, or the cost of the natural gas commodity itself, to natural gas producers and suppliers. Variations in the utility's cost of gas expense result from changes in gas sales volumes, the price of the gas purchased and the level of gas costs collected through the operation of firm gas cost recovery mechanisms. Under these regulated recovery mechanisms, Washington Gas records cost of gas expense equal to the cost of gas recovered from customers and included in revenues. The difference between the firm gas costs incurred and the gas costs recovered from customers is deferred on the balance sheet as an amount to be collected from or refunded to customers in future periods. Therefore, increases or decreases in the cost of gas associated with sales made to firm customers have no direct effect on Washington Gas' net revenues and net income. Changes in the cost of gas can cause significant variations in Washington Gas' cash provided by or used in operating activities. Washington Gas receives from or pays to its customers in the District of Columbia and Virginia, carrying costs associated with under-collected or over-collected gas costs recovered from its customers using short-term interest rates. Additionally, included in Utility cost of gas\u201d for Washington Gas are the net margins associated with our asset optimization program. To the extent these amounts are shared with customers, they are a reduction to the cost of gas invoiced to customers. Refer to the section entitled Market Risk\u201d for a further discussion of Washington Gas' optimization program.\nThe average commodity cost of gas invoiced to Washington Gas (excluding the cost and related volumes applicable to asset optimization) were $0.28, $0.37, $0.30, and $0.27 per therm for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, three months ended December 31, 2018, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral Factors Affecting Liquidity\nWashington Gas generally meets its liquidity and capital needs through cash on hand, retained earnings, the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, and equity infusions from its parent holding companies, routed through Wrangler. Access to short-term debt markets is necessary for funding our short-term liquidity requirements, the most significant of which include buying natural gas and pipeline capacity, and financing both accounts receivable and storage gas inventory. We have accessed long-term capital markets primarily to fund capital expenditures and retire long-term debt. Under the Merger commitments agreed to by AltaGas and Washington Gas during the Merger and other rules imposed by regulatory commissions or laws in Washington Gas' service territory, the Company is prohibited and/or restricted in its ability to make advances or issue loans to an affiliate or parent holding company without prior regulatory commission approval.\nOur plans provide sufficient liquidity to satisfy our financial obligations. Generally, pursuant to its Merger commitments, Washington Gas can make dividend payments in the ordinary course of business unless any of the following regulatory\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nlimitations apply: (i) Washington Gas will not pay extraordinary dividends to its parent for three years from the date of the Merger close, (ii) Washington Gas will not pay dividends to its parent company if Washington Gas' senior unsecured debt rating is below investment grade or (iii) Washington Gas will not make a dividend payment to its parent company if the payment would result in its equity level to drop below 48%. At December 31, 2019, we had no significant restrictions on our cash balances or retained earnings that would affect the payment of dividends.\nShort-Term Cash Requirements and Related Financing\nWashington Gas has seasonal short-term cash requirements to fund the purchase of storage gas inventory in advance of the winter heating season. The Company collects the cost of gas under cost recovery mechanisms approved by our regulators.\nIn the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year, Washington Gas' large sales volumes cause its cash requirements to peak when combined storage inventory, accounts receivable, and unbilled revenues are at their highest levels. In the second and third quarters of each calendar year, after the heating season, Washington Gas typically experiences a seasonal net loss due to reduced demand for natural gas. During this period, large amounts of Washington Gas' current assets are converted to cash.\nWashington Gas uses short-term debt in the form of commercial paper or unsecured short-term bank loans to fund seasonal cash requirements. Our policy is to maintain back-up bank credit facilities in an amount equal to or greater than our expected maximum commercial paper position. In December 2019, we classified $100.0 million commercial paper balance as \"Long-term debt\" on Washington Gas' balance sheets due to its ability and intent to refinance these balances on a long-term basis.\nOn July 19, 2019, Washington Gas entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a term of five years, plus two one-year extension options, available with the bank group's approval (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility amended and restated Washington Gas' prior $350 million credit facility and permits Washington Gas to borrow up to $450 million with an option to increase the facility by an additional $100 million with the bank group's approval, for a total potential maximum borrowing of $550 million. The interest rate of loans made under the credit facilities will be a fluctuating rate per annum that will be set using certain parameters at the time each loan is made. Bank credit balances available to Washington Gas under the existing credit facility, net of commercial paper balances were $50.0 million and $54.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLong-Term Cash Requirements and Related Financing\nThe primary drivers of our long-term cash requirements are capital expenditures and long-term debt maturities. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to adding new utility customers and system supply and maintaining the safety and reliability of Washington Gas' distribution system.\nSecurity Ratings\nOn December 11, 2019, Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P) revised its outlook on AltaGas from negative to stable, and raised the senior unsecured debt credit rating for Washington Gas from BBB+ to A- and its outlook from negative to stable. Washington Gas has ring fencing measures in place that financially separate Washington Gas from WGL, AltaGas and its affiliates as a way to protect its consumers from financial instability or bankruptcy that may be experienced by Washington Gas' parents or affiliates. S&P views the ring-fencing provisions sufficient to insulate Washington Gas from AltaGas and its other subsidiaries to warrant three-notches of ratings separation between Washington Gas and AltaGas. The credit rating for Washington Gas' commercial paper remained at A-2.\nOn January 30, 2020, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) downgraded the ratings of Washington Gas' senior unsecured debt credit rating to A3 from A2 and its commercial paper rating to P-2 from P-1. The outlook for Washington Gas is stable. Moody's affirmed the ratings of WGL's Baa1 for senior unsecured rating and P-2 commercial paper rating and changed its outlook to stable from negative.\nThe table below reflects the credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of Washington Gas as of December 31, 2019. \n(a) The credit ratings by Fitch Ratings for Washington Gas were revised on July 10, 2018 and the long-term debt ratings outlook was adjusted to stable.\n.\nRatings Triggers and Certain Debt Covenants\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nUnder the terms of Washington Gas' revolving credit agreements and private placement notes, the ratio of consolidated financial indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0 (65.0%). At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Washington Gas' ratios of consolidated financial indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization were 52% and 47%, respectively. In addition, Washington Gas is required to inform lenders of changes in corporate existence, financial conditions, litigation and environmental warranties that might have a material effect on debt ratings. The failure to inform the lenders' agent of material changes in these areas might constitute default under the agreements. Additionally, failure to pay principal or interest on any other indebtedness may be deemed a default under our credit agreements. A default, if not remedied, may lead to a suspension of further loans and/or acceleration in which obligations become immediately due and payable. In addition, certain of the credit facilities of Washington Gas contain cross-default provisions. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our revolving credit facilities, term loan facility, and private placement notes.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes Washington Gas' net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017:\n\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nWashington Gas' cash flows from operating activities principally reflect gas sales and deliveries and the cost of operations. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $203.3 million for the calendar year 2019, a $147.0 million increase from calendar year 2018. The increase was mainly driven by decreased cash payments for Merger commitments and related costs due to the Merger in 2018.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities was $219.4 million in the calendar year 2019 compared to $448.8 million in 2018. The $219.4 million cash flows from financing activities in 2019 was mainly driven by $298.5 million proceeds from issuance of medium-term note in September 2019, $103.5 million net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, offset by $50.0 million long-term debt repayment and $100.7 million in dividend payments on preferred and common stocks. Additionally, we paid $28.7 million to redeem three outstanding series of preferred stock in December 2019. The $448.8 million cash flows from financing activities in 2018 was mainly driven by $402.7 million capital infusion from our parent company, $134.0 million net proceeds from short-term borrowings, offset by $50 million long-term debt repayment and $90.8 million dividend payments on preferred and common stocks in 2018.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities totaled $433.0 million and $440.3 million for the calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which primarily consists of capital expenditures made by Washington Gas.\nThe following table depicts our actual capital expenditures for calendar years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, three months ended December 31, 2018, and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. Our capital outlays include expenditures to extend service to new areas, and to ensure safe, reliable and improved service for our utility.\n\n(a) Includes certain projects that support the existing distribution system.\n(b)Represents capital expenditures (excluding cost of removal), both approved, and expected to be approved, under our Accelerated Pipeline Replacement Programs in all jurisdictions. Refer to the section entitled \"Accelerated Pipeline Replacement Programs\" for a further discussion.\n(c)Excludes Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and cost of removal.\nAccelerated Pipe Replacement Programs (APRPs). APRPs are in place in all three of our jurisdictions. Washington Gas is accelerating pipe replacement in order to reduce risk and further enhance the safety and reliability of the pipeline system. Each regulatory commission having jurisdiction over Washington Gas' retail rates has APRPs with an associated surcharge mechanism to recover the cost, including a return, on those capital investments between base rate cases. In contrast to the traditional rate-making approach to capital investments, for the APRPs, Washington Gas is receiving recovery for these investments through the approved surcharges for each program and is authorized to invest in each of these programs over a five-year period. The following table summarizes the status of our current accelerated pipe replacement programs in three of\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nour jurisdictions. \nRefer to \"Rates and Regulatory Matters\" for a further discussion on rate case decisions during the periods including the transfer of costs from surcharge to base rate recovery.\nContractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments.\nContractual Obligations\nWashington Gas has certain contractual obligations incurred in the normal course of business that require fixed and determinable payments in the future. These commitments include long-term debt, unconditional purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services, certain natural gas commodity commitments and our commitments related to the business process outsourcing program. In addition, Washington Gas has made certain commitments related to the Merger with AltaGas.\nThe total contractual obligations and commitments for Washington Gas at December 31, 2019 for future calendar years are shown below.\n\n(a)Represents minimum payments for natural gas transportation, storage and peaking contracts.\n(b)Represents scheduled repayment of principal.\n(c)Represents the scheduled interest payments associated with long-term debt.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(d)Includes known and reasonably likely commitments to purchase fixed volumes of natural gas. Cost estimates are based on forward market prices at December 31, 2019. Certain of our gas purchase agreements have optionality, which may cause increases in these commitments.\n(e) Represents fixed costs to service providers related to various contracts for business process outsourcing.\n(f) Includes committed payments related to certain environmental response costs.\n(g)Represents the estimated future payments of Merger commitments that has been accrued but not paid. At December 31, 2019, the cumulative amount of merger commitments that has been expensed was $136.6 million, of which $17.0 million has not been paid. In addition, there are certain regulatory commitments that were and will be expensed as the costs are incurred, including the hiring of damage prevention trainers in each jurisdiction for a total of $2.4 million over 5 years; investing up to $70.0 million over a 10 year period to further extend natural gas service; and spending $8.0 million for leak mitigation within 3 years after the Merger close.\nThe table above reflects fixed and variable obligations. Certain of these estimates reflect likely purchases under various contracts and may differ from minimum future contractual commitments disclosed in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nFor commitments related to Washington Gas' pension and post-retirement benefit plans, refer to Note 10 - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk\nWholesale Credit Risk\nWashington Gas enters into transactions with wholesale counterparties for the purpose of meeting firm ratepayer commitments, to optimize the value of its long-term capacity assets, and for hedging natural gas costs. Certain wholesale suppliers that sell natural gas to Washington Gas may have relatively low credit ratings or may not be rated by major credit rating agencies. In the event of a counterparty's failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas or fulfill its payment obligations, Washington Gas may incur losses that would typically be passed through to its sales customers under the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; however, Washington Gas may be at risk for financial loss to the extent these losses are not passed through to its customers.\nWashington Gas operates under an existing wholesale counterparty credit policy that is designed to mitigate credit risks through requirements for credit enhancements including, but not limited to, letters of credit, parent guarantees and cash collateral when deemed necessary. In accordance with this policy, Washington Gas has obtained credit enhancements from certain of its counterparties. If certain counterparties or their guarantors meet the policy's creditworthiness criteria, Washington Gas may grant unsecured credit to those counterparties or their guarantors. The creditworthiness of all counterparties is continuously monitored.\nThe following table provides information on our credit exposure, net of collateral, to wholesale counterparties as of December 31, 2019.\n\n(a) Investment grade is primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty. If the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher-rated entity (e.g., its parent), it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor. Included in Investment grade\u201d are counterparties with a minimum Standard & Poor's or Moody's Investor Service rating of BBB- or Baa3, respectively.\n(b) Includes the net of all open positions on energy-related derivatives subject to mark-to-market accounting requirements and the net receivable/payable for the realized transactions. Amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that contractual netting arrangements are in place.\n(c) Represents cash deposits and letters of credit received from counterparties, not adjusted for probability of default.\n(d) Using a percentage of the net exposure.\nRetail Credit Risk\nWashington Gas is at risk of non-payment of utility bills by customers. To manage this customer credit risk, Washington Gas may require cash deposits from high risk customers to cover payment of their bills until the requirements for the deposit refunds are met. Base rates include a provision for recovery of uncollectible accounts based on historical levels of charge offs of accounts receivable. Washington Gas also has a provision in its Gas Administrative Charge mechanism that includes an\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nallowance for commodity amounts included in uncollectible accounts. In addition, Washington Gas has a POR program in Maryland and the District of Columbia, whereby it purchases receivables from participating energy marketers at approved discount rates, which incorporates the risk of non-payment by the retail customers for these receivables.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity price risk, weather risk and interest-rate risk. The following discussion describes these risks and our management of them.\nPrice Risk\nWashington Gas faces price risk associated with the purchase and sale of natural gas. Washington Gas generally recovers the cost of the natural gas to serve customers through gas cost recovery mechanisms as approved in jurisdictional tariffs; therefore, a change in the price of natural gas generally has no direct effect on Washington Gas' net income. However, Washington Gas is responsible for following competitive and reasonable practices in purchasing natural gas for its customers.\nTo manage price risk associated with its natural gas supply to its firm customers, Washington Gas: (i) actively manages its gas supply portfolio to balance sales and delivery obligations; (ii) injects natural gas into storage during the summer months when prices are generally lower, and withdraws that gas during the winter heating season when prices are generally higher and (iii) enters into hedging contracts and other contracts that may qualify as derivative instruments related to the sale and purchase of natural gas.\nWashington Gas executes commodity-related physical and financial contracts in the form of forward, futures and option contracts as part of an asset optimization program that is managed by its internal staff. Under this program, Washington Gas realizes value from its long-term natural gas transportation and storage capacity resources when they are not being fully used to serve utility customers. Regulatory sharing mechanisms in all three jurisdictions allow the profit from these transactions to be shared between Washington Gas' customers and shareholders.\nThe following two tables summarize the changes in the fair value of our net assets (liabilities) associated with the energy-related derivatives during the calendar year ended December 31, 2019.\n\n\nThe maturity dates in calendar years of our net assets (liabilities) associated with the energy-related derivatives recorded at fair value at December 31, 2019, is summarized in the following table based on the level of the fair value calculation under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n\nRefer to Note 14 - Derivatives and Note 15 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to Financial Statements for a further discussion of our derivative activities and fair value measurements.\nWeather Risk\nThe Company is exposed to various forms of weather risk due to seasonal operations, with a significant portion of its revenues derived from the delivery of natural gas to residential and commercial heating customers during the winter heating season. Weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered by Washington Gas. Weather patterns tend to be more volatile during shoulder\u201d months within our calendar year in which Washington Gas is going into or coming out of the winter heating season. During the shoulder months within quarters ending June 30 (particularly in April and May) and December 31 (particularly in October and November), customer heating usage may not highly correlate with historical levels or with the level of heating degree days that occur, particularly when weather patterns experienced are not consistently cold or warm.\nWashington Gas does not have a weather related instrument or billing adjustment mechanism in the District of Columbia and as a result, its revenues are volume driven and current rates are based upon an assumption of normal weather. Without weather protection strategies, variations from normal weather will cause our earnings to increase or decrease depending on the weather pattern.\nBilling Adjustment Mechanisms. In Maryland, Washington Gas has an RNA billing mechanism that is designed to stabilize the level of net revenues collected from Maryland customers by eliminating the effect of deviations in customer usage caused by variations in weather from normal levels and other factors such as conservation. In Virginia, Washington Gas has a WNA billing adjustment mechanism that is designed to eliminate the effect of variations in weather from normal levels on utility net revenues for residential, commercial and industrial and group metered apartment customers. Additionally, in Virginia, as part of the CARE plan, Washington Gas has a CRA mechanism that eliminates the effect of conservation for residential customers.\nInterest-Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest-rate risk associated with our short-term and long-term financing. Washington Gas has previously utilized derivative instruments in order to reduce its exposure to the risk of interest-rate volatility, with resulting gains and losses typically being recovered through each jurisdiction's overall allowed rate of return.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, Washington Gas had outstanding commercial paper and project financing of $399.5 million and $311.5 million, respectively. The carrying amount of commercial paper and project financing approximates their fair value. At December 31, 2019, a change of 100 basis points in the underlying average interest rate for our commercial paper would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately $2.3 million.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, Washington Gas had outstanding fixed-rate MTNs and other long-term debt of $1,330.9 million and $1,035.0 million, respectively, excluding current maturities and commercial paper. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of Washington Gas' fixed-rate debt was $1,480.8 million. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that fair value would increase by approximately $77.3 million or decrease by approximately $71.6 million if interest rates were to decline or increase by 10%, respectively, from current market levels. In general, such an increase or decrease in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if Washington Gas were to reacquire some or all of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity.\nAt December 31, 2019, a total of $1,202.5 million, or approximately 89.3% of the face amount of Washington Gas' outstanding long-term debt, excluding current maturities and commercial paper, have make-whole call options which would require us to pay a premium over the face amount if we were to exercise them.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nRefer to Note 14 - Derivatives of the Notes to Financial Statements for a further discussion of our interest-rate risk management activity.\nRates and Regulatory Matters\nWashington Gas makes its requests to modify existing rates based on its determination of the level of net investment in plant and equipment, operating expenses, and a level of return on invested capital that is just and reasonable.\n\n(a) The overall rate of return and return on equity are rates requested by Washington Gas in its most recent rate case.\n(b) The Virginia order did not specify an overall allowed rate of return.\nThe following is a discussion of significant current regulatory matters. Refer to the section \"Accelerated Pipe Replacement Programs\" above for a discussion of regulatory matters associated with those programs.\nDistrict of Columbia Jurisdiction\nPROJECTpipes 2 Plan. On December 7, 2018, Washington Gas filed a request with the PSC of DC for approval of the PROJECTpipes 2 Plan, the second phase of Washington Gas' APRP, to cover the period from October 1, 2019 through December 31, 2024. The PROJECTpipes 2 Plan seeks to address relatively higher risk pipe associated with an aging infrastructure by replacing pipe materials and components, as well as adding new features to enhance the safety of Washington Gas' system, with an estimated total cost of $305.3 million. On September 5, 2019, the PSC of DC issued an order extending the original PROJECTpipes an additional six months through March 31, 2020, in an amount not to exceed $12.5 million. On September 13, 2019, Washington Gas submitted a revised five year final annual project list. The parties are engaged in settlement negotiations, as directed by the PSC of DC. On February 14, 2020, a final settlement conference report was submitted, and the PSC of DC continues to review the PROJECTpipes 2 Plan.\nDistrict of Columbia 2020 Rate Case. On January 13, 2020, Washington Gas filed an application for authority to increase charges for gas service in the District of Columbia. The requested rates are designed to collect approximately $35.2 million in total annual revenues. Of the approximate $35.2 million revenue increase requested, $9.1 million represents costs collected through the PROJECTpipes surcharge; therefore, the incremental amount of the base rate increase is approximately $26.1 million. The Company requests that new rates be implemented by January 1, 2021.\nMaryland Jurisdiction\nMaryland Rate Case 2019. On April 22, 2019, Washington Gas filed an application with the PSC of MD to increase its base rates for natural gas service, generating $30.8 million in additional annual revenue. The revenue increase represented an increase in base rates of $35.9 million, of which approximately $5.0 million relates to costs being collected through the monthly STRIDE surcharges for system upgrades. The filing also requested an increase to the Company's return on equity from 9.7% to 10.4%. The Company also proposed a Safety Response Tracker to reconcile leak management expenses above or below the test year level on an annual basis outside of a base rate case. On August 30, 2019 Washington Gas, the Staff of the PSC of MD, the Maryland Office of People's Counsel and the Apartment & Office Building Association of Metropolitan Washington submitted a Stipulation and Settlement designed to generate an additional $27.0 million in base rates. The Stipulation stated an overall rate of return of 7.42%, established a return on equity of 9.70%, and stated a common equity ratio of 53.5% for the Company's hypothetical capital structure. The Stipulation and Settlement did not adopt the proposed Safety Response Tracker. On October\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n15, 2019 the PSC of MD issued Final Order No. 89303 which accepted the Stipulation and Settlement without change. Pursuant to Order No. 89303 Washington Gas's revised base rates went into effect for service rendered on or after October 15, 2019.\nMaryland Rate Case 2018. On May 15, 2018, Washington Gas filed an application with the PSC of MD to increase its base rates for natural gas service, generating $41.3 million in additional annual revenue. The PSC of MD granted the Company $28.6 million in new revenues and increased the Company's return on equity to 9.7%. On January 10, 2019, Washington Gas filed an application for rehearing with the PSC of MD, alleging two errors in the agency's final order. On June 25, 2019, the PSC of MD issued an order granting in part and denying in part Washington Gas' application for a rehearing, resulting in an additional $0.5 million increase in annual distribution revenues.\nMaryland Show-Cause Order. Following the NTSB hearing that examined the August 10, 2016, explosion and fire at an apartment complex in Silver Spring, Maryland, on September 5, 2019, the PSC of MD ordered the Company, within 30 days, to (i) provide a detailed response to the NTSB's probable cause findings, and (ii) provide evidence regarding the status of a 2003 mercury regulator replacement program, and if the program was not completed, to show cause why the Commission should not impose a civil penalty on the Company. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.\nVirginia Jurisdiction\nApplication for the SAVE Act Plan Rider. On September 3, 2019, Washington Gas filed with the SCC of VA an application for approval of the SAVE Plan Rider for Calendar Year 2020 of its annual adjustment of its Commission-approved SAVE Act under which the Company's 2020 SAVE Plan Rider is reconciled and adjusted. Washington Gas proposed to invest approximately $132 million over calendar year 2020 to continue work on previously approved distribution and transmission system accelerated replacement programs. Public comments were due by October 31, 2019. The SCC of VA issued an Order on November 26, 2019, approving a SAVE Rider for 2020 in the amount of approximately $13.8 million. The SAVE Rider rates approved by the Commission reflect an investment of approximately $127 million over the 12-month period beginning on January 1, 2020.\nVirginia Rate Case - 2018. On July 31, 2018, Washington Gas filed an application with the SCC of VA to increase its base rates for natural gas service by $37.6 million, which includes $14.7 million of revenue associated with natural gas pipeline replacement initiatives previously approved by the SCC of VA and paid by customers through a monthly rider. Additionally, the requested revenue increase incorporated the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). Interim rates became effective, subject to refund, for usage in the January 2019 billing cycle. On September 16, 2019, the HE issued a report that made certain recommendations, to which the Company responded on October 21, 2019. Thereafter, on December 20, 2019, the SCC of VA issued a Final Order that accepted some of the HE's findings and either rejected or made adjustments to others. The Final Order included approval of (i) an increase in base rates of $13.2 million to reflect the transfer of $101.9 million of SAVE investment from the SAVE Rider to rate base (no additional revenue increase); and (ii) amortization of unprotected plant-related and non-plant-related excess deferred income tax over 8 years.\nFor the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, Washington Gas made the following pre-tax adjustments based on the HE's recommendations and Commission's Final Order: (i) reduced Operating revenues-Utility\u201d by $7.9 million to accrue additional amounts of liability subject to refund; (ii) reduced Operating revenues-Utility\u201d by $9.0 million associated with the revised amortization of the Tax Act liability; and (iii) wrote off $2.0 million in Regulatory Assets - Other\u201d and charged to Operation and maintenance\u201d expense. Additionally, the Company reduced income tax expense by $8.5 million related to the amortization of excess deferred income tax, and recorded $5.5 million after-tax impairment of a tax regulatory asset related to flow through income taxes. The total impact from the adjustments for the calendar year 2019 was a $18.9 million reduction in \"Income before income taxes\" and a $10.9 million reductions in \"Net Income\" on Washington Gas' statements of operations.\nOn January 9, 2020, Washington Gas filed a petition for reconsideration regarding the Commission's decision to disallow recovery through base rates of the $7.1 million regulatory asset related to previously flowed through income taxes. On January 30, 2020, the Commission issued its Order on Reconsideration denying the Company's petition, and directing the Company to issue rate refunds, as well as to begin return of regulatory liabilities over a twelve-month period, within 90 days of the date of the Order on Reconsideration.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\nPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the selection and the application of appropriate technical accounting guidance to the relevant facts and circumstances of our operations, as well as our use of estimates to compile the consolidated financial statements. The application of these accounting policies involves judgment regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events, including the likelihood of success of particular regulatory initiatives, the likelihood of realizing estimates for legal and environmental contingencies, and the probability of recovering costs and investments in both the regulated utility and non-regulated business segments.\nWe have identified the following critical accounting policies discussed below that require our judgment and estimation, where the resulting estimates have a material effect on our net income.\nAccounting for Revenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized in the period in which customers obtain control of promised goods or services and performance obligations are satisfied in an amount equal to the consideration in which the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for the promised goods and services. Generally, control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customer when the natural gas is delivered to the customer.\nFor regulated deliveries of natural gas, Washington Gas reads meters and bills customers on a monthly cycle basis. The billing cycles for customers do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes. Washington Gas accrues estimated unbilled revenues for gas that has been delivered but not yet billed at the end of an accounting period by jurisdiction and customer class, including the estimated effects of billing adjustment mechanisms.\nSee Note 1 - Accounting Policies and Note 2 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.\nAccounting for Regulatory Operations-Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\nWashington Gas accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, Regulated Operations (ASC Topic 980), which results in differences in the application of GAAP between regulated and unregulated businesses.\nWashington Gas' jurisdictional tariffs contain mechanisms that provide for the recovery of the cost of gas consumed by firm customers. Under these mechanisms, Washington Gas periodically adjusts its firm customers' rates to reflect fluctuations in the cost of gas. Annually, Washington Gas reconciles the difference between the gas costs collected from firm customers and the cost of gas incurred, defers any difference and either recovers deficiencies from, or refunds excess recoveries to, customers over a period of time authorized by its regulators.\nThe current regulatory environment and Washington Gas' specific facts and circumstances support both the continued application of ASC Topic 980 for our regulatory activities and the conclusion that all of our regulatory assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 are recoverable or refundable through rates charged to customers. See Note 3 - Regulated Operations of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our regulated operations.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nWe account for contingent liabilities utilizing ASC Topic 450, Contingencies. By their nature, the amount of the contingency and the timing of a contingent event and any resulting accounting recognition are subject to our judgment of such events and our estimates of the amounts. Actual results related to contingencies may be difficult to predict and could differ significantly from the estimates included in reported earnings. For a discussion of contingencies, see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nAccounting for Derivatives\nWe enter into both physical and financial contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and apply the fair value requirements of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The financial and physical contracts that qualify as derivative instruments and are subject to the mark-to-market accounting requirements are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are recoverable or refundable to customers when they settle are subject to ASC Topic 980 and are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities while changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not affected by rate regulation are reflected in earnings.\nJudgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment for our derivative instruments, including our ability to: (i) evaluate contracts and other activities as derivative instruments subject to the accounting guidelines of ASC Topic 815; (ii) determine whether or not our derivative instruments are recoverable from or refundable to customers in future periods and\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(iii) derive the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments. See Note 14 - Derivatives of the Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our derivatives.\nAccounting for Fair Value Instruments\nFair value is based on actively quoted market prices when they are available. In the absence of actively quoted market prices, we seek indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. If pricing information from external sources is not available, internal models are used to estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and/or the use of statistical methods. These inputs are used with industry standard valuation methodologies. See Note 15 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our valuation methodologies.\nAccounting for Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nWashington Gas maintains defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans for eligible employees (the \"Plans\"). The measurement of the Plans' obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of factors, such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the Plans, earnings on the Plans' assets and mortality rates. The following assumptions are also critical to this measurement. These assumptions are derived on an annual basis with the assistance of a third-party actuarial firm:\n \u2022 Discount rate, \n \u2022 Expected long-term return on plan assets, \n \u2022 Rate of compensation increase, \n \u2022 Healthcare cost trend rate and \n \u2022 Projected increases to the Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) plan stipend. \nThe following table illustrates the effect of changing these actuarial assumptions, while holding all other assumptions constant:\n\nSee Note 10 - Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional discussion of the Plans.\nWashington Gas Light Company\nPart II", "item_7_tables": "Table 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Key points include:\n\n- In 2019, Washington Gas's net income increased to $99.8 million compared to a net loss of $35.4 million in 2018, mainly due to higher operating revenues from regulatory cases, pipe replacement programs, and customer growth. Additionally, a significant decrease in operation and maintenance expenses contributed to this improvement.\n- Critical factors for the company's success include operating a safe and reliable gas distribution system, securing sufficient gas supplies, being competitive with other energy sources, accessing liquidity sources, recovering costs in customer rates, and earning a reasonable return on invested capital.\n- The company primarily assesses its operations using the non-GAAP measure EBITDA, which excludes interest, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization.\n- Revenues increased by $58.0 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to regulatory rate cases, pipe replacements, customer growth, and contracts. The overall increase in net revenues was $36.2 million for the same period.\n- Operation and maintenance expenses decreased by $159.5 million in 2019 due to lower merger commitments and related costs, partially offset by higher employee labor costs.\n- Income tax rate was significantly lower in 2019 primarily due to adjustments related to deferred taxes.\n- Various financial data, gas delivery, and weather statistics are provided, noting the effect of weather on gas deliveries and sales.\n- Short-term cash requirements are primarily met through cash on hand, borrowing, and equity infusions. The company maintains certain credit facilities to support liquidity and capital needs.\n- The company faces interest-rate risk on its outstanding debt and manages this risk, in part, with derivative instruments subject to accounting standards.\n- Certain critical accounting policies involve judgment and estimates and can significantly affect net income. These policies include accounting for revenue, regulatory operations, contingencies, derivatives, fair value instruments, and pension and post-retirement benefit plans.\n- Washington Gas is subject to regulatory oversight, with several major rate increase requests and regulatory matters discussed, including the status and results of rate cases in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nThe MD&A also reiterates the importance of regulatory mechanisms such as billing adjustment mechanisms in Maryland and Virginia that aim to insulate the company's revenues from variations due to weather. Additionally, it covers the company's approach to managing wholesale and retail credit risks and market risks, including price risk, weather risk, and interest-rate risk.\n\nThe financial stability of Washington Gas is tied to the performance of its operating segment, the ongoing regulatory environment, and its ability to manage various risks effectively."}
