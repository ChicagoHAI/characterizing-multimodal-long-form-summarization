Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto.\nOverview\nITG is an independent broker and financial technology firm that improves the efficiency and execution quality of institutional trading. ITG helps clients understand market trends, mitigate risk and navigate increasingly complex markets. A leader in electronic trading since launching the POSIT crossing network in 1987, ITG takes a consultative approach in delivering the highest quality execution and liquidity solutions along with analytical tools and research. The firm is headquartered in New York with offices in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region.\nOur business is organized into four reportable operating segments (see Note 22, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements):\n\u2022 U.S. Operations\n\u2022 Canadian Operations\n\u2022 European Operations\n\u2022 Asia Pacific Operations\nOur four operating segments provide the following types of products and services:\n\u2022 Electronic Brokerage-includes self-directed trading by clients using algorithms, smart routing and matching through POSIT in cash equities (including single stocks and portfolio lists), futures and options;\n\u2022 Research, Sales and Trading-includes (a) differentiated, unbiased, data-driven equity research through the use of innovative data harvesting and analysis and (b) portfolio trading and high-touch trading desks providing execution expertise and trading ideas based on investment research;\n\u2022 Platforms-includes trade order and execution management software applications in addition to network connectivity; and\n\u2022 Analytics-includes (a) tools enabling portfolio managers and traders to improve pre-trade and real-time execution performance, (b) portfolio construction and optimization decisions and (c) securities valuation.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2015, the Company is presenting its regional segment results excluding the impact of corporate activity. For this purpose, corporate activity includes investment income and other gains as well as costs not associated with operating the businesses within the Company's regional segments. These costs include, among others, (a) the costs of being a public company, such as certain staff costs, a portion of external audit fees, and reporting, filing and listing costs, (b) intangible asset amortization, (c) interest expense, (d) professional fees associated with our global transfer pricing structure, (e) foreign exchange gains or losses and (f) certain non-operating expenses. Prior to this change in segment measure, corporate activity was included in the region where the income/expense was earned/incurred, which primarily was in the U.S. Operations segment. Prior period segment data has been restated to conform to the 2015 presentation.\nSources of Revenues\nRevenues from our products and services are generated from commissions and fees, recurring (subscriptions) and other sources.\nCommissions and fees are derived primarily from (i) commissions charged for trade execution services, (ii) income generated on net executions, whereby equity orders are filled at different prices within or at the National Best Bid and Offer (\"NBBO\") and (iii) commission sharing arrangements between ITG Net (our private value-added FIX-based financial electronic communications network) and third-party brokers and alternative trading systems whose trading products are made available to our clients on our order management system (\"OMS\") and execution management system (\"EMS\") applications in addition to commission sharing arrangements for our ITG Single Ticket Clearing Service and our ITG RFQ-hub request-for-quote service. Because commissions are earned on a per-transaction basis, such revenues fluctuate from period to period depending on (a) the volume of securities traded through our services in the U.S. and Canada, (b) the contract value of securities traded in Europe and the Asia Pacific region and (c) our commission rates. Certain factors that affect our volumes and contract values traded include: (i) macro trends in the global equities markets that affect overall institutional equity trading activity, (ii) competitive pressure, including pricing, created by a proliferation of electronic execution competitors and (iii) potential changes in market structure in the U.S. and other regions. In addition to share volume, revenues from net executions are also impacted by the width of spreads within the NBBO. Trade orders are delivered to us from our OMS and EMS products and other vendors' products, direct computer-to-computer links to customers through ITG Net and third-party networks and phone orders from our customers.\nRecurring revenues are derived from the following primary sources: (i) connectivity fees generated through ITG Net for the ability of the sell-side to receive orders from, and send indications of interest\nto, the buy-side and for the sell-side to receive requests-for-quotes through ITG RFQ-hub, (ii) subscription revenue generated from providing research, (iii) software and analytical products and services and (iv) maintenance and customer technical support for ITG OMS.\nOther revenues include: (1) income from principal trading in the Company's Canadian Operations, including arbitrage trading, (2) the net spread on foreign exchange transactions executed on a principal basis to facilitate equity trades by clients in different currencies, as well as on other foreign currency transactions unrelated to equity trading, (3) the net interest spread earned on securities borrowed and loaned matched book transactions, (4) transaction advisory services provided to potential purchasers of energy-related investments, (5) non-recurring consulting services, such as one-time implementation and customer-training-related activities, (6) investment and interest income, (7) interest income on securities borrowed in connection with customers' settlement activities, (8) market gains/losses resulting from temporary positions in securities assumed in the normal course of agency trading (including client errors and accommodations) and (9) non-recurring gains and losses such as divestitures.\nExpenses\nCompensation and employee benefits, our largest expense, consist of salaries and wages, incentive compensation, employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation fluctuates based on revenues, profitability and other measures, taking into account the landscape for key talent. Incentive compensation includes a combination of cash and deferred share-based awards. Only the cash portion of incentive compensation is a variable expense in the current period. As a result, our ratio of compensation expense to revenues may fluctuate from period-to-period based on revenue levels.\nTransaction processing expense consists of costs to access various third-party execution destinations and to process, clear and settle transactions. These costs tend to fluctuate with share and trade volumes, the mix of trade execution services used by clients and the rates charged by third parties.\nOccupancy and equipment expense consists primarily of rent and utilities related to leased premises, office equipment and depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and leasehold improvements.\nTelecommunications and data processing expenses primarily consist of costs for obtaining market data, data associated with our investment research offerings, telecommunications services and systems maintenance.\nOther general and administrative expenses primarily include software amortization, consulting, business development, professional fees and intangible asset amortization.\nInterest expense consists primarily of costs associated with outstanding debt and credit facilities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"), management uses certain \"non-GAAP financial measures\" as such term is defined in SEC Regulation G. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in, or excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations, and therefore a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone. In addition, management believes the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results as the items described below reflect certain unique and/or non-operating items\nsuch as acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring charges, large write-offs or items outside of management's control.\nAdjusted revenues, adjusted expenses and adjusted net income together with related per share amounts are non-GAAP performance measures that we believe are useful to assist investors in gaining an understanding of the trends and operating results for our core business. These measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, results reported under U.S. GAAP.\nReconciliations of adjusted revenues, adjusted expenses and adjusted net income to revenues, expenses and net income and related per share amounts as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013 are provided below, as applicable (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts). There were no such adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

$120.5 million. The pre-tax gain of $107.7 million is net of a working capital adjustment on the closing balance sheet, direct costs related to the sale, including share-based compensation costs, and the carrying value of the net assets disposed.\n(2)In August 2015, we reached a final settlement with the SEC to pay an aggregate amount of $20.3 million in connection with the SEC's investigation into a proprietary trading pilot operated in 2010 and 2011. During 2015, we incurred $4.9 million in legal and related costs associated with this matter.\n(3)In December 2015, we amended the capital structure of our principal holding company outside North America to provide continued flexibility for the movement of global capital. This amendment accelerated the U.S. taxation of amounts earned outside of North America resulting in a tax charge of $6.5 million.\n(4)In the second quarter of 2013, we incurred a $1.6 million charge to implement a restructuring plan to close our technology research and development facility in Israel and migrate that function to an outsourced-service-provider model effective January 1, 2014. This plan primarily focused on reducing costs by limiting our geographic footprint while maintaining the necessary technological expertise via a consulting arrangement. This restructuring plan triggered the recognition of a tax charge of $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2013 associated with the anticipated withdrawal of capital from Israel. We also reduced previously-recorded 2012 and 2011 restructuring accruals of $1.6 million to reflect the sub-lease of previously-vacated office space and certain legal and other employee-related charges deemed unnecessary.\n(5)During the fourth quarter of 2012, we began to build out and ready our new lower Manhattan headquarters while continuing to occupy our then-existing headquarters in midtown Manhattan and as a result incurred duplicate rent charges through June 2013.\n(6)In the second quarter of 2013, we moved into our new headquarters and incurred a one-time non-operating charge, which included a reserve for the remaining lease obligation for the previous midtown Manhattan headquarters.\nExecutive Summary for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nConsolidated Overview\nOur 2015 results reflect the significant negative impact on our business from the SEC Settlement in August 2015. Immediately following the preliminary announcement of the SEC Settlement in late July, we experienced a sharp drop in trading activity as a number of clients either suspended or significantly reduced the amount of trade flow sent to ITG. Management has worked actively to reassure clients of the integrity of our business through face-to-face meetings and due diligence processes that have resulted in substantially all of our clients resuming some level of trading with ITG. Average daily trading commissions in the U.S. during the fourth quarter were 12% better than the lows of August and September with buy-side trading activity showing signs of stabilization. While the momentum in our recovery has been consistent, the full restoration of our business remains a work in progress.\nOur 2015 results also include the December sale of our energy research business to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus, a global private equity firm, for $120.5 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $107.7 million and an after-tax gain of $91.4 million, or $2.66 per share (\"Energy Research Sale\"). Having monetized the significant value in the energy research business, we are currently evaluating alternatives for the use of the net proceeds. Based on 2015 results, the Energy Research Sale is expected to reduce annual revenues by approximately $20 million and reduce annual expenses by approximately $6 million, net of a new licensing charge to distribute the energy research product to our trading clients.\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis, we earned net income of $91.6 million, or $2.63 per diluted share in 2015. Our U.S. GAAP results include the gain from the Energy Research Sale as well as $25.2 million in costs related to the SEC Settlement and a $6.5 million tax charge to amend the capital structure of our operations outside of North America. This capital structure amendment will provide continued flexibility with the movement of global capital without incremental tax costs. Adjusted net income (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) was $29.8 million, or $0.86 per diluted share compared to $50.9 million, or $1.40 per diluted share for 2014, due primarily to a 6% reduction in revenues, excluding the gain on the Energy Research Sale. Expenses of $513.6 million were 4% higher than 2014 while adjusted expenses (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) of $488.4 million, which excluded the costs related to the SEC Settlement, decreased 1% from the prior year. The reduction in expenses was largely driven by lower compensation costs from compensation reversals associated with the management changes announced in August, mark-to-market adjustments on stock awards to Canadian employees that will be settled in cash and lower revenues and profitability. Costs were also lowered as compared to 2014 due to the exchange rate impact from the stronger U.S. Dollar.\nSegment Discussions\nRegional segment results exclude the impact of corporate activity. In 2015, corporate activity increased pre-tax income by $64.7 million on a U.S. GAAP basis and decreased pre-tax income by $17.8 million on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the Energy Research Sale and the costs related to the SEC Settlement. In 2014, corporate activity reduced pre-tax income by $20.5 million.\nU.S. commission revenues were 9% lower in 2015 reflecting the sharp drop in our customer trading activity following the SEC Settlement. Our U.S. average daily volume was 162.2 million shares, virtually flat with 2014, trailing the 8% growth in U.S. consolidated daily market volume. Although our total volumes were relatively unchanged, a larger portion of our volumes were from sell-side accounts\ndue in part to our efforts to grow this business. Sell-side trading volume increased to 59% of overall volume, compared to 52% in 2014, diluting our overall revenue capture rate per share to $0.0043 compared to $0.0047 in 2014.\nIn Canada, commissions and fees were down 18% as sharply lower business levels in the fourth quarter following the SEC Settlement and a 14% reduction in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate offset a strong start to the year. MATCH Now's volume grew by more than 30% during 2015.\nOur European business has held up well in the wake of our SEC Settlement, although growth in our trading activity was offset by a 7% decline in the average British Pound exchange rate. In local currency terms, market-wide trading activity was up nearly 16%, according to BATS Global Markets Inc., driven by increased market volatility during the first half of the year. In comparison, the value traded by ITG Europe grew 30% in local currency terms and 20% in U.S. Dollar terms. While growth in our value traded in Europe exceeded market growth, like the U.S., a greater portion was from sell-side accounts. We continued our strategy of growing the liquidity on our platform by expanding our sell-side client business and our business across continental Europe, which enabled us to capitalize on the improved market activity.\nThe last two quarters in 2015 were challenging periods for our Asia Pacific business. After a strong first half of the year, when we achieved record profitability in both the first and second quarters, our Asia Pacific business struggled in the last two quarters following the SEC Settlement. Much of the decline is due to a drop-off in trading activity by U.S. based clients in the wake of the SEC Settlement. While the reduction in commissions in the second half of the year ended our run of four consecutive quarters of profitability, we were still able to generate a pre-tax profit of $1.6 million in 2015 compared to a pre-tax loss of $1.7 million in 2014 due to a 3% growth in revenues and a 4% reduction in costs from cost savings initiatives implemented in late 2014.\nCapital Resource Allocation\nDuring 2015, we repurchased 2.0 million shares under our stock repurchase program for $42.0 million. We intend to continue to use share repurchases to offset dilution from the issuance of stock under employee compensation plans and to opportunistically return capital to stockholders, depending on market conditions and any strategic activity that may necessitate alternative uses of capital. We may elect to conduct future share repurchases through open market purchases, private transactions or automatic share repurchase programs under SEC Rule 10b5-1.\nIn April 2015, our Board of Directors initiated a dividend program under which we began to pay quarterly dividends, subject to quarterly declarations by the Board of Directors. During 2015, our Board of Directors declared and we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per share in each of the second, third and fourth quarters totaling $7.0 million, in the aggregate.\nResults of Operations-Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nU.S. Operations\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>$ in thousands\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>200,325 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>220,567 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(20,242 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recurring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,556 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(54 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>285,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>306,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,310 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,402 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,451 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,507 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>16,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>35,803 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(19,803 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(55 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile total annual volumes were essentially unchanged, commissions and fees decreased 9% reflecting the higher proportion of average daily volumes executed by lower-priced sell-side clients, which increased to 59% of our volumes compared to 52% in 2014, adversely impacting our revenue per share. Following the SEC Settlement we saw a decline in trading activity from some buy-side clients that either suspended trading or significantly reduced the amount of trade flow sent to ITG. While substantially all of the accounts that suspended trading with ITG have resumed sending some level of trade flow, much work remains to bring all of our clients back to the level of engagement we experienced prior to the SEC Settlement. This decline in buy-side trade flow also had a negative impact on sell-side activity as there was less liquidity in POSIT, resulting in fewer crossing opportunities.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>U.S. Operations: Key Indicators*\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total trading volume (in billions of shares)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average trading volume per day (in millions of shares)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.0043 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.0047 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(0.0004 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. market trading days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*Excludes activity from ITG Net commission share arrangements.\nRecurring revenues increased due to higher research subscriptions in addition to higher connectivity fees. Connectivity fees increased primarily from an increase in revenue from global connections previously recorded in our Canadian and Asia Pacific Operations segments, as a result of a change in our attribution method, and an increase in revenue from connections delivered out of the ITG PM solution. These increases in connectivity revenue were partially offset by connections lost due to the impact of client attrition from our OMS product. Research subscriptions increased from higher subscription revenues from new accounts subscribing to our investment research products and a shift in the recognition of certain corporate subscriptions revenue in energy research to the U.S. Operations segment from the Canadian Operations segment, partially offset by the impact of the discontinuation of our healthcare market research business in May 2015. The Energy Research Sale is expected to reduce recurring revenues in the U.S. Operations segment by approximately $18 million in 2016.\nOther revenues decreased primarily due to declines in transaction advisory services revenues from our energy research team and lower net revenue earned from stock loan matched book transactions.\nCompensation and employee benefits costs decreased as a result of lower incentive-based compensation to our management team associated with global profitability levels and with lower headcount at the end of the year. As a percentage of revenues, compensation costs increased to 45.1% as compared to 42.4% in 2014 due to the impact of the fixed components of compensation costs on lower revenues and our need to retain staff during this challenging period.\nTransaction processing costs increased due to an increase in the proportion of trading by clients where liquidity was taken (which typically costs more than transactions in which clients are providing liquidity on an execution venue), more settlement tickets processed and higher costs from outsourcing the clearing of select accounts to a third party. These factors, along with the impact of our lower average revenue per share, increased transaction processing costs as a percentage of commissions and fees to 21.2% from 17.8% in 2014.\nOther expenses decreased $3.5 million due to a higher credit for research and development costs charged to other segments as more of these resources have been centralized in the U.S., along with lower depreciation and software amortization.\nCanadian Operations\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>$ in thousands\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>49,169 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>59,992 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(10,823 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(18 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recurring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,012 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(42 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,605 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(19 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,823 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(16 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(927 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,239 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(12 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,989 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(13 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>10,643 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>17,259 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(6,616 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(38 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrency translation from a weaker Canadian Dollar decreased total Canadian revenues and expenses by $9.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease of $2.6 million to pre-tax income.\nCanadian commissions and fees were down 18% as the impact of the SEC Settlement and a weaker Canadian dollar offset strong trading levels in the early part of the year.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher market data costs.\nEuropean Operations\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>$ in thousands\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>113,633 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>113,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(355 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recurring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(176 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(502 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(65 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>28,244 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>34,081 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(5,837 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(17 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrency translation from a weaker British Pound decreased European revenues and expenses by $10.1 million and $7.9 million, respectively, diminishing pre-tax income by $2.2 million.\nEuropean results in 2015 include the results of ITG RFQ-hub for a full year versus five months in 2014 following the July 30, 2014 acquisition date.\nOur European commissions and fees were flat with 2014 despite an unfavorable currency impact of $8.9 million and a lower average commission rate primarily due to an increase in sell-side clients trading in POSIT and an increase in institutional clients using our trading algorithms. While the growth in our value traded was nearly twice the growth rate of overall European value traded, an increased portion was from sell-side clients. Although we earn a lower commission rate on sell-side trading, this activity produces incremental profitability, uses excess capacity and grows the liquidity in POSIT.\nRecurring revenue increased primarily from a full period of ITG RFQ-hub activity as compared to only five months in 2014 as well as an increase in billed analytics revenue. Other revenues improved due to a lower impact of trade errors and client accommodations.\nCompensation and benefits increased due to higher salaries from a full period of ITG RFQ-hub, investments in our sales team and higher deferred stock-based compensation associated with awards granted for 2014 and 2013.\nTransaction processing costs increased as a result of an increase in the average daily notional value traded. As a percentage of commissions and fees, transaction processing costs increased to 26.3% from 23.5% in 2014 due to the impact of a higher proportion of value traded by lower-rate, sell-side clients.\nOther expenses increased due to higher charges for global research and development costs, increases in business development and customer connectivity costs and a full period of costs from

by $2.5 million.\nAsia Pacific commissions and fees increased despite unfavorable currency translation and the impact of the SEC Settlement in the second half of 2015 due to strong order flow earlier in the year by U.S. clients and local Asian clients trading into Australia and Hong Kong and the increased use of our trading algorithms and our POSIT Alert block crossing system.\nRecurring revenues decreased primarily from lower revenue earned from global connections due to a change in our attribution method and currency translation. Other revenues improved due to lower client accommodations and errors.\nCompensation and employee benefits decreased due to lower headcount, reduced severance charges and favorable currency translation.\nTransaction processing costs decreased due to a higher proportion of our trading in markets where our costs are lower. As a percentage of commissions and fees, these costs declined to 24.2% from 25.7% in 2014.\nOther expenses increased primarily because of the higher charges for global research and development costs, higher software amortization and consulting expenses.\nCorporate\nCorporate activity includes investment income and other gains as well as costs not associated with operating the businesses within our regional segments. These costs include, among others, (a) the costs of being a public company, such as certain staff costs, a portion of external audit fees, and reporting, filing and listing costs, (b) intangible asset amortization, (c) interest expense, (d) professional fees associated with our global transfer pricing structure, (e) foreign exchange gains or losses and (f) certain non-operating expenses.\nFor 2015, we reported pre-tax income from Corporate activity of $64.7 million, reflecting the $107.7 million gain on the Energy Research Sale, $0.9 million of investment income and $43.9 million of costs. For 2014, we incurred a pre-tax loss from Corporate activity of $20.5 million, reflecting\ninvestment income of $1.3 million and costs of $21.8 million. The $22.1 million increase in costs reflected the $20.3 million cost for the SEC Settlement and related legal and other fees of $4.9 million, offset in part by $2.1 million of reductions in compensation and benefits from the executive changes announced in August 2015 and lower intangible amortization costs due to the full amortization of certain assets.\nConsolidated income tax expense\nOur effective tax rate was 24.5% for 2015 compared to 21.7% for 2014. The low rate in 2015 primarily reflected the impact of a low tax rate on the Energy Research Sale from the availability of a deductible basis that was mostly written-off for book purposes in 2012, significant income generated in Europe where we are taxed at a lower rate and profitability generated in Asia Pacific where we are not incurring a tax cost due to the availability of net operating losses. These impacts were partially offset by a tax expense of $6.5 million on a deemed dividend associated with an amendment to the capital structure of our operations outside North America. The low rate in 2014 reflects the impact of strong earnings from Europe, where we are taxed at a lower rate, and a $2.7 million tax benefit arising from settling multi-year tax return positions offset by establishing additional reserves for other tax positions. Our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.\nResults of Operation-Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nAs noted above, effective in the first quarter of 2015, the Company is presenting its regional segment results excluding the impact of corporate activity.

While we also saw lower revenue per share from sell-side clients, we continued to see improvement in the revenue per share from buy-side clients.\nThe higher revenue per share from buy-side clients was driven by higher rates for clients' use of our POSIT Alert block crossing system and our high-touch and portfolio trading services.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>U.S. Operations: Key Indicators*\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total trading volume (in billions of shares)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average trading volume per day (in millions of shares)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.0047 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.0047 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. market trading days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*Excludes activity from ITG Net commission share arrangements.\nRecurring revenues decreased due to the impact of client attrition from our OMS product, resulting in lower OMS subscription revenues and connectivity fees, partially offset by higher research subscriptions.\nOther revenues increased primarily due to an increase in transaction advisory services revenues generated by our energy research team. This increase more than offset a reduction in revenues generated by our stock loan matched book business, which included a gain of $2.5 million in 2013 related to adjustments to historical dividend withholdings.\nCompensation and employee benefits increased as a result of headcount increases and from higher incentive-based compensation to our management team associated with increased global profitability.\nTransaction processing costs declined more than the decrease in commissions and fees due to lower options volumes, which incur higher costs proportionally than our cash equity trading and lower execution costs from client use of our algorithm technology. As a percentage of commissions and fees, transaction processing costs declined to 17.8% from 18.2% during 2013.\nOther expenses decreased $12.4 million, reflecting lower data center, data and connectivity expenses from our cost reduction initiatives and lower depreciation, software amortization and consulting fees. There was also a higher credit for research and development costs charged to other segments. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in employee recruiting and legal fees.\nCanadian Operations\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

million, respectively, resulting in a decrease of $1.4 million to pre-tax income.\nCanadian commissions and fees increased $2.5 million despite an unfavorable currency translation of $4.0 million, principally due to the growth in MATCH Now volumes of more than 80%.\nRecurring revenues increased due to a higher number of billable network connections through ITG Net and our billing for market data consumed by clients.\nOther revenues increased slightly due to an increase in income earned on foreign exchange transactions and principal arbitrage trading, partially offset by losses on client accommodations and the impact of currency translation.\nCompensation and employee benefits costs decreased primarily due to the impact of currency translation and a decrease in share-based compensation, which fluctuates for legacy awards to Canadian employees based on the changes in the market price of our stock, partially offset by an increase in incentive-based compensation related to increased profitability.\nTransaction processing costs decreased due to lower rates for clearing and settlement from contract renegotiation with our clearing provider, lower execution costs as a higher percentage of our volume was executed in MATCH Now and the impact of currency translation. As a percentage of commission and fees, transaction processing costs declined to 16.2% from 18.6% in 2013.\nThe decrease in other expenses was primarily driven by lower connectivity expenses and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by higher charges for historical market data and legal-related expenses.\nEuropean Operations\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>$ in thousands\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>113,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>79,639 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>34,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recurring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(502 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(547 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>34,081 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>20,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>14,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrency translation from a stronger average British Pound increased European revenues and expenses by $6.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively, adding $1.6 million to pre-tax income.\nEuropean results include substantially all the ITG RFQ-hub operations since the July 30, 2014 acquisition date, adding $2.0 million in revenues, mostly recurring, and $2.2 million in expenses.\nOur European commissions and fees grew 43% in 2014 as compared to 2013, far outpacing the 16% growth in market-wide value traded. The investments we made in our infrastructure and our product suite resulted in increased activity from buy-side and sell-side clients using our electronic\nbrokerage offerings, including our trading algorithms and POSIT, and from clients using our POSIT Alert block crossing system. We also saw increased commissions from the use of our high-touch trading services. Commissions and fees also benefitted from $5.9 million in favorable currency translation.\nRecurring revenues increased primarily from the new connectivity revenue from ITG RFQ-hub.\nCompensation and employee benefits increased due to higher incentive-based compensation related to improved performance, increase in headcount, including employees from the ITG RFQ-hub acquisition, and the impact of the unfavorable currency translation of $1.7 million. This increase was offset, in part, by $3.1 million in lower compensation associated with the outsourcing of our research and development facility in Israel to a third-party service provider.\nTransaction processing costs increased due to the significant increase in value traded. However, transaction processing costs declined as a percentage of commissions and fees to 23.5% from 24.6% in 2013 due to the impact of a higher percentage of our value traded crossed in POSIT, including our POSIT Alert block crossing system, and our initiatives to reduce settlement and clearing costs.\nOther expenses increased due to higher charges for (a) global research and development costs, (b) historical market data, (c) consulting costs, net of capitalization, attributable to the outsourcing of our research and development facility in Israel to a third-party service provider, (d) marketing costs and (e) the additional costs added by ITG RFQ-hub.\nAsia Pacific Operations\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

impact on our pre-tax loss.\nAsia Pacific commissions and fees increased despite a reduction in market-wide trading activity and unfavorable currency translation due to the growth in commissions from clients using our POSIT Alert block crossing system and algorithmic trading capabilities as well as from higher commission-sharing revenues.\nThe growth in recurring revenues primarily reflects growth in the number of billable network connections through ITG Net and the decrease in other revenues is due to higher client trade accommodations, which totaled $1.2 million in 2014, compared to $0.3 million in 2013.\nCompensation and employee benefits increased due to increases in headcount and employee termination charges, partially offset by higher capitalized compensation for software development and favorable currency translation.\nTransaction processing costs decreased due to a reduction in value traded and our efforts to reduce execution and settlement costs. As a percentage of commissions and fees, transaction processing costs declined to 25.7% from 28.6% in 2013.\nThe increase in other expenses reflects higher charges for historical market data and global research and development, as well as increases in hardware and software maintenance and connectivity, partially offset by reductions in market data costs.\nCorporate\nFor 2014, we incurred a pre-tax loss from Corporate activity of $20.5 million, reflecting investment income of $1.3 million and costs of $21.8 million. For 2013, we incurred a pre-tax loss from Corporate activity of $25.9 million, reflecting investment income of $1.5 million and costs of $27.4 million. Corporate costs in 2013 included $2.6 million of duplicate rent charges associated with the build out of our new headquarters in lower Manhattan while we still occupied our then-existing headquarters in midtown Manhattan, a $3.9 million charge related to our office move, including a reserve for the remaining lease obligation and a $1.5 million restructuring charge to close our technology research and development facility in Israel. These costs were partially offset by a $1.3 million reversal of previously-recorded 2012 and 2011 restructuring liabilities as a portion of the space vacated in our Los Angeles office was sub-let and certain legal and other employee-related accruals were deemed unnecessary.\nConsolidated income tax expense\nOur effective tax rate was 21.7% for 2014 compared to 27.8% for 2013. The low rate in both periods is the result of a significantly higher proportion of our pre-tax income arising from our European Operations, which is taxed at a lower rate. Additionally, in the U.S. we recorded a $2.7 million tax benefit in 2014 for the net impact of settling multi-year tax return positions and establishing additional reserves for other tax positions. In 2013, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the resolution of a tax contingency in Europe and the recognition of the full-year 2012 research and experimentation credit in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2013 due to the timing of tax legislation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Our liquidity requirements result from our working capital needs, which include clearing and settlement activities, as well as our regulatory capital needs. A substantial portion of our assets is liquid, consisting of cash and cash equivalents or assets readily convertible into cash. Cash is principally invested in U.S. government money market mutual funds and other money market mutual funds. At December 31, 2015, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $330.7 million. Included in this amount is $117.1 million of cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside the United States. Due to the December 2015 amendment to the capital structure of our operations outside of North America, which included a deemed dividend on all cumulative undistributed earnings, we currently do not foresee a need to repatriate funds from certain foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. by way of additional dividends. Should we need to do so in the future, our effective tax rate may increase. As a self-clearing broker-dealer in the U.S., we are subject to cash deposit requirements with clearing organizations that may be large in relation to total liquid assets and may fluctuate significantly based upon the nature and size of customers' trading activity and market volatility. At December 31, 2015, we had interest-bearing\nsecurity deposits totaling $23.3 million with clearing organizations in the U.S. for the settlement of equity trades. In the normal course of our U.S. settlement activities, we may also need to temporarily finance customer securities positions from short settlements or delivery failures. These financings may be funded from existing cash resources, borrowings under stock loan transactions or short-term bank loans under our committed facility. In January 2016, we entered into a new $150 million 364-day revolving credit agreement (the \"New Credit Agreement\") with a syndicate of banks and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The terms and conditions of the New Credit Agreement are similar to the credit agreement that matured in January 2016 (see Note 14, Borrowings, and Note 24, Subsequent Events), except that the unused commitment fee is 0.75%.\nWe self-clear equity trades in Hong Kong and Australia, maintaining restricted cash deposits of $26.0 million primarily to support overdraft facilities and we had deposits with clearing organizations of $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. In Europe, we maintain $1.6 million in restricted cash related to protected client funds and we had deposits with our clearing and settlement agents of $41.9 million at December 31, 2015.\nWe expect our cash balance to decline in the first quarter of 2016 as we make tax payments related to the gain from the Energy Research Sale and certain restructurings we have completed, as well as upon payment of incentive compensation for 2015.\nCapital Resources\nCapital resource requirements relate to capital purchases, as well as business investments, and are generally funded from operations. When required, as in the case of a major acquisition, our strong cash generating ability has historically allowed us to access U.S. capital markets.\nOperating Activities\nThe table below summarizes the effect of the major components of operating cash flow.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>91,570 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>50,892 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>31,085 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of energy business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(107,699 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash items included in net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,898 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of changes in receivables/payables from/to customers and brokers\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34,627 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,274 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of changes in other working capital and operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,129 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>67,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,517 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>48,746 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>142,540 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>45,192 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2015 was driven by lower adjusted net income (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The 2014 increase was driven by strong net income and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nIn the normal course of our clearing and settlement activities worldwide, cash is typically used to fund restricted or segregated cash accounts (under regulations and otherwise), broker and customer fails to deliver/receive, securities borrowed, deposits with clearing organizations and net activity related to receivables/payables from/to customers and brokers. The cash requirements vary from day to day depending on volume transacted and customer trading patterns.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities of $73.3 million includes the net proceeds from the Energy Research Sale, partially offset by investments in software development projects and computer hardware and software.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $58.6 million primarily reflects repurchases of ITG common stock, our dividend program, shares withheld for net settlements of share-based awards and repayments of long-term debt, offset by net proceeds from short-term bank borrowings that are used to support our settlement activities.\nDuring 2015, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $51.0 million, which was funded from our available cash resources. Of these shares, 2.0 million were purchased under our Board of Directors' authorization for a total cost of $42.0 million. An additional 0.4 million shares ($9.0 million) pertained solely to the satisfaction of minimum statutory withholding tax upon the net settlement of equity awards. As of December 31, 2015, the total remaining number of shares currently available for repurchase under ITG's stock repurchase program was 2.8 million. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions and other factors. We may elect to conduct future share repurchases through open market purchases, private transactions or automatic share repurchase programs under SEC Rule 10b5-1.\nIn April 2015, our Board of Directors initiated a dividend program under which we began to pay quarterly dividends, subject to quarterly declarations by the Board of Directors. During 2015, our Board of Directors declared and we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per share in each of the second, third and fourth quarters totaling $7.0 million, in the aggregate.\nRegulatory Capital\nITG Inc., AlterNet and ITG Derivatives are subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. ITG Inc. has elected to use the alternative method permitted by Rule 15c3-1, which requires that ITG Inc. maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of $1.0 million or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions, as defined. AlterNet and ITG Derivatives have elected to use the basic method permitted by Rule 15c3-1, which requires that they each maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of 62/3% of aggregate indebtedness or $100,000 and $1.0 million, respectively. Dividends or withdrawals of capital cannot be made if capital is needed to comply with regulatory requirements.\nNet capital balances and the amounts in excess of required net capital at December 31, 2015 for the U.S. Operations are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>U.S. Operations\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Net Capital </th> <th> </th> <th>Excess </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ITG Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>91,360 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>90,360 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AlterNet\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ITG Derivatives\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, ITG Inc. had $7.3 million of cash in a Special Reserve Bank Account for the benefit of customers under the Customer Protection Rule pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3-3, Computation for Determination of Reserve Requirements and $2.5 million under agreements for proprietary accounts of broker-dealers.\nIn addition, our Canadian, European and Asia Pacific Operations have subsidiaries with regulatory capital requirements. The regulatory net capital balances and amount of regulatory capital in excess of\nthe minimum requirements applicable to each business at December 31, 2015, is summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands):\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Canadian Operations\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Net Capital </th> <th> </th> <th>Excess </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCanada\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>24,879 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>24,519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEuropean Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,481 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.K.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,502 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia Pacific Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAustralia\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hong Kong\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,296 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSingapore\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>427 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Outlook\nHistorically, our working capital, stock repurchase, dividend program and investment activity requirements have been funded from cash from operations and short-term loans, with the exception of strategic acquisitions, which at times have required long-term financing. We believe that our cash flow from operations, existing cash balances and our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating cash and regulatory capital needs, while also complying with the terms of the New Credit Agreement. However, our ability to borrow additional funds may be impacted by financial lending institutions' ability or willingness to lend to us on commercially acceptable terms.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nWe are a member of various U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges and clearing houses that trade and clear, respectively, equities and/or derivative contracts. Associated with our membership, we may be required to pay a proportionate share of financial obligations of another member who may default on its obligations to the exchanges or the clearing house. While the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships vary, in general, our guarantee obligations would arise only if the exchange had previously exhausted its resources. The maximum potential payout under these memberships cannot be estimated. We have not recorded any contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for these agreements and believe that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments amounted to $184.7 million in the aggregate and consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments due by period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Contractual obligations\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1-3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>3-5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase of goods and services\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>40,798 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>33,909 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,992 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>897 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,711 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum payments under certain employment arrangements(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>184,726 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,369 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>34,005 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>20,386 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>67,966 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Pursuant to employment arrangements, in the event of termination of employment without cause on December 31, 2015, we would be obligated to pay separation payments totaling $5.5 million.\nThe above information excludes $15.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits discussed in Note 9, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements, because it is not possible to estimate the time period when, or if, it might be paid to tax authorities.\nAs part of the $150 million, 364-day credit agreement we entered into in January 2016, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.75% on any unborrowed amounts.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented and will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard provides companies with a single five step revenue recognition model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The standard will also require significant additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures describing the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt ASU 2014-09. The original standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, however, in April 2015, the FASB proposed a one-year deferral of this standard, with a new effective date of December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the impact of adoption on its financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In many instances, the application of such principles requires management to make estimates or to apply subjective principles to particular facts and circumstances. A change in the estimates or a variance in the application, or interpretation of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. could yield a materially different accounting result. Below is a summary of our critical accounting estimates where we believe that the estimations, judgments or interpretations that we made, if different, would have yielded the most significant differences in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill Impairment: Testing Methodology and Valuation Considerations\nWe obtained goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of certain of our subsidiaries. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired. We are required to periodically assess whether any of our goodwill is impaired. In order to do this, we apply judgment in determining our reporting units, which represent our business segments. Our annual goodwill impairment assessment involves assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the results of our qualitative analysis suggests that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss using a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment testing process is as follows:\n\u2022 Step one-the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value in order to identify potential impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit, potential impairment is indicated at the reporting unit level and step two of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and measure the potential impairment loss.\n\u2022 Step two-when potential impairment is indicated in step one, we compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit's tangible and (non-goodwill) intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination. Any excess in the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization\nIntangible assets with definite useful lives are subject to amortization and are evaluated for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an intangible asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. If such an event or change occurs, we estimate cash flows directly associated with the use of the intangible asset to test its recoverability and assess its remaining useful life. The projected cash flows require assumptions related to revenue growth, operating margins and other relevant market, economic and regulatory factors. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of a finite-lived intangible asset or asset group are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset, we then compare the carrying amount to its current fair value. We estimate the fair value using market prices for similar assets, if available, or by using a discounted cash flow model. We then recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.\nShare-Based Compensation\nIn accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, share-based payment transactions require the application of a fair value methodology that involves various assumptions. The fair value of options awarded is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the following assumptions: expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common stock price and expected dividend yield. We estimate the expected life of the\noptions using historical data and the volatility of our common stock is estimated based on a combination of the historical volatility and the implied volatility from traded options. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards with a market condition is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation is an iterative technique designed to estimate future payouts by taking into account our current stock price, the volatility of our common stock, risk-free rates, and a risk-neutral valuation methodology.\nAlthough both models meet the requirements of ASC 718, the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of the underlying awards, as it does not consider other factors important to those share-based compensation awards, such as continued employment, periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability.\nContingencies and Uncertainties\nThe use of estimates is important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation, mediation, arbitration, regulatory proceedings and various contingencies and uncertainties. Our accounting for contingencies and uncertainties follows the guidance prescribed under ASC 450, Contingencies, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. We review the status of each significant matter and evaluate its potential financial exposure on a regular basis. If the potential loss from any exposure is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainties in the evaluation process, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time, so actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision. As additional information becomes available, our reassessment of the potential liability may lead to a revision in our estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the company's results of operations for any particular period.\nIncome Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions\nASC 740, Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance may be recorded against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or results of operations.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit for each such position that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits. Such estimates involve interpretations of regulations, rulings, case law, etc. and are inherently complex. Our estimates may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes as resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions typically would not be known for several years after completion of any fiscal year. The impact of our reassessment of uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto.\nOverview\nITG is an independent broker and financial technology firm that improves the efficiency and execution quality of institutional trading. ITG helps clients understand market trends, mitigate risk and navigate increasingly complex markets. A leader in electronic trading since launching the POSIT crossing network in 1987, ITG takes a consultative approach in delivering the highest quality execution and liquidity solutions along with analytical tools and research. The firm is headquartered in New York with offices in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region.\nOur business is organized into four reportable operating segments (see Note 22, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements):\n\u2022 U.S. Operations\n\u2022 Canadian Operations\n\u2022 European Operations\n\u2022 Asia Pacific Operations\nOur four operating segments provide the following types of products and services:\n\u2022 Electronic Brokerage-includes self-directed trading by clients using algorithms, smart routing and matching through POSIT in cash equities (including single stocks and portfolio lists), futures and options;\n\u2022 Research, Sales and Trading-includes (a) differentiated, unbiased, data-driven equity research through the use of innovative data harvesting and analysis and (b) portfolio trading and high-touch trading desks providing execution expertise and trading ideas based on investment research;\n\u2022 Platforms-includes trade order and execution management software applications in addition to network connectivity; and\n\u2022 Analytics-includes (a) tools enabling portfolio managers and traders to improve pre-trade and real-time execution performance, (b) portfolio construction and optimization decisions and (c) securities valuation.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2015, the Company is presenting its regional segment results excluding the impact of corporate activity. For this purpose, corporate activity includes investment income and other gains as well as costs not associated with operating the businesses within the Company's regional segments. These costs include, among others, (a) the costs of being a public company, such as certain staff costs, a portion of external audit fees, and reporting, filing and listing costs, (b) intangible asset amortization, (c) interest expense, (d) professional fees associated with our global transfer pricing structure, (e) foreign exchange gains or losses and (f) certain non-operating expenses. Prior to this change in segment measure, corporate activity was included in the region where the income/expense was earned/incurred, which primarily was in the U.S. Operations segment. Prior period segment data has been restated to conform to the 2015 presentation.\nSources of Revenues\nRevenues from our products and services are generated from commissions and fees, recurring (subscriptions) and other sources.\nCommissions and fees are derived primarily from (i) commissions charged for trade execution services, (ii) income generated on net executions, whereby equity orders are filled at different prices within or at the National Best Bid and Offer (\"NBBO\") and (iii) commission sharing arrangements between ITG Net (our private value-added FIX-based financial electronic communications network) and third-party brokers and alternative trading systems whose trading products are made available to our clients on our order management system (\"OMS\") and execution management system (\"EMS\") applications in addition to commission sharing arrangements for our ITG Single Ticket Clearing Service and our ITG RFQ-hub request-for-quote service. Because commissions are earned on a per-transaction basis, such revenues fluctuate from period to period depending on (a) the volume of securities traded through our services in the U.S. and Canada, (b) the contract value of securities traded in Europe and the Asia Pacific region and (c) our commission rates. Certain factors that affect our volumes and contract values traded include: (i) macro trends in the global equities markets that affect overall institutional equity trading activity, (ii) competitive pressure, including pricing, created by a proliferation of electronic execution competitors and (iii) potential changes in market structure in the U.S. and other regions. In addition to share volume, revenues from net executions are also impacted by the width of spreads within the NBBO. Trade orders are delivered to us from our OMS and EMS products and other vendors' products, direct computer-to-computer links to customers through ITG Net and third-party networks and phone orders from our customers.\nRecurring revenues are derived from the following primary sources: (i) connectivity fees generated through ITG Net for the ability of the sell-side to receive orders from, and send indications of interest\nto, the buy-side and for the sell-side to receive requests-for-quotes through ITG RFQ-hub, (ii) subscription revenue generated from providing research, (iii) software and analytical products and services and (iv) maintenance and customer technical support for ITG OMS.\nOther revenues include: (1) income from principal trading in the Company's Canadian Operations, including arbitrage trading, (2) the net spread on foreign exchange transactions executed on a principal basis to facilitate equity trades by clients in different currencies, as well as on other foreign currency transactions unrelated to equity trading, (3) the net interest spread earned on securities borrowed and loaned matched book transactions, (4) transaction advisory services provided to potential purchasers of energy-related investments, (5) non-recurring consulting services, such as one-time implementation and customer-training-related activities, (6) investment and interest income, (7) interest income on securities borrowed in connection with customers' settlement activities, (8) market gains/losses resulting from temporary positions in securities assumed in the normal course of agency trading (including client errors and accommodations) and (9) non-recurring gains and losses such as divestitures.\nExpenses\nCompensation and employee benefits, our largest expense, consist of salaries and wages, incentive compensation, employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation fluctuates based on revenues, profitability and other measures, taking into account the landscape for key talent. Incentive compensation includes a combination of cash and deferred share-based awards. Only the cash portion of incentive compensation is a variable expense in the current period. As a result, our ratio of compensation expense to revenues may fluctuate from period-to-period based on revenue levels.\nTransaction processing expense consists of costs to access various third-party execution destinations and to process, clear and settle transactions. These costs tend to fluctuate with share and trade volumes, the mix of trade execution services used by clients and the rates charged by third parties.\nOccupancy and equipment expense consists primarily of rent and utilities related to leased premises, office equipment and depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and leasehold improvements.\nTelecommunications and data processing expenses primarily consist of costs for obtaining market data, data associated with our investment research offerings, telecommunications services and systems maintenance.\nOther general and administrative expenses primarily include software amortization, consulting, business development, professional fees and intangible asset amortization.\nInterest expense consists primarily of costs associated with outstanding debt and credit facilities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"), management uses certain \"non-GAAP financial measures\" as such term is defined in SEC Regulation G. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in, or excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations, and therefore a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone. In addition, management believes the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results as the items described below reflect certain unique and/or non-operating items\nsuch as acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring charges, large write-offs or items outside of management's control.\nAdjusted revenues, adjusted expenses and adjusted net income together with related per share amounts are non-GAAP performance measures that we believe are useful to assist investors in gaining an understanding of the trends and operating results for our core business. These measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, results reported under U.S. GAAP.\nReconciliations of adjusted revenues, adjusted expenses and adjusted net income to revenues, expenses and net income and related per share amounts as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013 are provided below, as applicable (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts). There were no such adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

$120.5 million. The pre-tax gain of $107.7 million is net of a working capital adjustment on the closing balance sheet, direct costs related to the sale, including share-based compensation costs, and the carrying value of the net assets disposed.\n(2)In August 2015, we reached a final settlement with the SEC to pay an aggregate amount of $20.3 million in connection with the SEC's investigation into a proprietary trading pilot operated in 2010 and 2011. During 2015, we incurred $4.9 million in legal and related costs associated with this matter.\n(3)In December 2015, we amended the capital structure of our principal holding company outside North America to provide continued flexibility for the movement of global capital. This amendment accelerated the U.S. taxation of amounts earned outside of North America resulting in a tax charge of $6.5 million.\n(4)In the second quarter of 2013, we incurred a $1.6 million charge to implement a restructuring plan to close our technology research and development facility in Israel and migrate that function to an outsourced-service-provider model effective January 1, 2014. This plan primarily focused on reducing costs by limiting our geographic footprint while maintaining the necessary technological expertise via a consulting arrangement. This restructuring plan triggered the recognition of a tax charge of $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2013 associated with the anticipated withdrawal of capital from Israel. We also reduced previously-recorded 2012 and 2011 restructuring accruals of $1.6 million to reflect the sub-lease of previously-vacated office space and certain legal and other employee-related charges deemed unnecessary.\n(5)During the fourth quarter of 2012, we began to build out and ready our new lower Manhattan headquarters while continuing to occupy our then-existing headquarters in midtown Manhattan and as a result incurred duplicate rent charges through June 2013.\n(6)In the second quarter of 2013, we moved into our new headquarters and incurred a one-time non-operating charge, which included a reserve for the remaining lease obligation for the previous midtown Manhattan headquarters.\nExecutive Summary for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nConsolidated Overview\nOur 2015 results reflect the significant negative impact on our business from the SEC Settlement in August 2015. Immediately following the preliminary announcement of the SEC Settlement in late July, we experienced a sharp drop in trading activity as a number of clients either suspended or significantly reduced the amount of trade flow sent to ITG. Management has worked actively to reassure clients of the integrity of our business through face-to-face meetings and due diligence processes that have resulted in substantially all of our clients resuming some level of trading with ITG. Average daily trading commissions in the U.S. during the fourth quarter were 12% better than the lows of August and September with buy-side trading activity showing signs of stabilization. While the momentum in our recovery has been consistent, the full restoration of our business remains a work in progress.\nOur 2015 results also include the December sale of our energy research business to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus, a global private equity firm, for $120.5 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $107.7 million and an after-tax gain of $91.4 million, or $2.66 per share (\"Energy Research Sale\"). Having monetized the significant value in the energy research business, we are currently evaluating alternatives for the use of the net proceeds. Based on 2015 results, the Energy Research Sale is expected to reduce annual revenues by approximately $20 million and reduce annual expenses by approximately $6 million, net of a new licensing charge to distribute the energy research product to our trading clients.\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis, we earned net income of $91.6 million, or $2.63 per diluted share in 2015. Our U.S. GAAP results include the gain from the Energy Research Sale as well as $25.2 million in costs related to the SEC Settlement and a $6.5 million tax charge to amend the capital structure of our operations outside of North America. This capital structure amendment will provide continued flexibility with the movement of global capital without incremental tax costs. Adjusted net income (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) was $29.8 million, or $0.86 per diluted share compared to $50.9 million, or $1.40 per diluted share for 2014, due primarily to a 6% reduction in revenues, excluding the gain on the Energy Research Sale. Expenses of $513.6 million were 4% higher than 2014 while adjusted expenses (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) of $488.4 million, which excluded the costs related to the SEC Settlement, decreased 1% from the prior year. The reduction in expenses was largely driven by lower compensation costs from compensation reversals associated with the management changes announced in August, mark-to-market adjustments on stock awards to Canadian employees that will be settled in cash and lower revenues and profitability. Costs were also lowered as compared to 2014 due to the exchange rate impact from the stronger U.S. Dollar.\nSegment Discussions\nRegional segment results exclude the impact of corporate activity. In 2015, corporate activity increased pre-tax income by $64.7 million on a U.S. GAAP basis and decreased pre-tax income by $17.8 million on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the Energy Research Sale and the costs related to the SEC Settlement. In 2014, corporate activity reduced pre-tax income by $20.5 million.\nU.S. commission revenues were 9% lower in 2015 reflecting the sharp drop in our customer trading activity following the SEC Settlement. Our U.S. average daily volume was 162.2 million shares, virtually flat with 2014, trailing the 8% growth in U.S. consolidated daily market volume. Although our total volumes were relatively unchanged, a larger portion of our volumes were from sell-side accounts\ndue in part to our efforts to grow this business. Sell-side trading volume increased to 59% of overall volume, compared to 52% in 2014, diluting our overall revenue capture rate per share to $0.0043 compared to $0.0047 in 2014.\nIn Canada, commissions and fees were down 18% as sharply lower business levels in the fourth quarter following the SEC Settlement and a 14% reduction in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate offset a strong start to the year. MATCH Now's volume grew by more than 30% during 2015.\nOur European business has held up well in the wake of our SEC Settlement, although growth in our trading activity was offset by a 7% decline in the average British Pound exchange rate. In local currency terms, market-wide trading activity was up nearly 16%, according to BATS Global Markets Inc., driven by increased market volatility during the first half of the year. In comparison, the value traded by ITG Europe grew 30% in local currency terms and 20% in U.S. Dollar terms. While growth in our value traded in Europe exceeded market growth, like the U.S., a greater portion was from sell-side accounts. We continued our strategy of growing the liquidity on our platform by expanding our sell-side client business and our business across continental Europe, which enabled us to capitalize on the improved market activity.\nThe last two quarters in 2015 were challenging periods for our Asia Pacific business. After a strong first half of the year, when we achieved record profitability in both the first and second quarters, our Asia Pacific business struggled in the last two quarters following the SEC Settlement. Much of the decline is due to a drop-off in trading activity by U.S. based clients in the wake of the SEC Settlement. While the reduction in commissions in the second half of the year ended our run of four consecutive quarters of profitability, we were still able to generate a pre-tax profit of $1.6 million in 2015 compared to a pre-tax loss of $1.7 million in 2014 due to a 3% growth in revenues and a 4% reduction in costs from cost savings initiatives implemented in late 2014.\nCapital Resource Allocation\nDuring 2015, we repurchased 2.0 million shares under our stock repurchase program for $42.0 million. We intend to continue to use share repurchases to offset dilution from the issuance of stock under employee compensation plans and to opportunistically return capital to stockholders, depending on market conditions and any strategic activity that may necessitate alternative uses of capital. We may elect to conduct future share repurchases through open market purchases, private transactions or automatic share repurchase programs under SEC Rule 10b5-1.\nIn April 2015, our Board of Directors initiated a dividend program under which we began to pay quarterly dividends, subject to quarterly declarations by the Board of Directors. During 2015, our Board of Directors declared and we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per share in each of the second, third and fourth quarters totaling $7.0 million, in the aggregate.\nResults of Operations-Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nU.S. Operations\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>$ in thousands\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>200,325 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>220,567 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(20,242 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recurring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,556 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(54 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>285,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>306,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,310 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,402 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,451 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,507 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>16,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>35,803 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(19,803 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(55 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile total annual volumes were essentially unchanged, commissions and fees decreased 9% reflecting the higher proportion of average daily volumes executed by lower-priced sell-side clients, which increased to 59% of our volumes compared to 52% in 2014, adversely impacting our revenue per share. Following the SEC Settlement we saw a decline in trading activity from some buy-side clients that either suspended trading or significantly reduced the amount of trade flow sent to ITG. While substantially all of the accounts that suspended trading with ITG have resumed sending some level of trade flow, much work remains to bring all of our clients back to the level of engagement we experienced prior to the SEC Settlement. This decline in buy-side trade flow also had a negative impact on sell-side activity as there was less liquidity in POSIT, resulting in fewer crossing opportunities.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>U.S. Operations: Key Indicators*\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total trading volume (in billions of shares)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average trading volume per day (in millions of shares)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.0043 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.0047 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(0.0004 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. market trading days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*Excludes activity from ITG Net commission share arrangements.\nRecurring revenues increased due to higher research subscriptions in addition to higher connectivity fees. Connectivity fees increased primarily from an increase in revenue from global connections previously recorded in our Canadian and Asia Pacific Operations segments, as a result of a change in our attribution method, and an increase in revenue from connections delivered out of the ITG PM solution. These increases in connectivity revenue were partially offset by connections lost due to the impact of client attrition from our OMS product. Research subscriptions increased from higher subscription revenues from new accounts subscribing to our investment research products and a shift in the recognition of certain corporate subscriptions revenue in energy research to the U.S. Operations segment from the Canadian Operations segment, partially offset by the impact of the discontinuation of our healthcare market research business in May 2015. The Energy Research Sale is expected to reduce recurring revenues in the U.S. Operations segment by approximately $18 million in 2016.\nOther revenues decreased primarily due to declines in transaction advisory services revenues from our energy research team and lower net revenue earned from stock loan matched book transactions.\nCompensation and employee benefits costs decreased as a result of lower incentive-based compensation to our management team associated with global profitability levels and with lower headcount at the end of the year. As a percentage of revenues, compensation costs increased to 45.1% as compared to 42.4% in 2014 due to the impact of the fixed components of compensation costs on lower revenues and our need to retain staff during this challenging period.\nTransaction processing costs increased due to an increase in the proportion of trading by clients where liquidity was taken (which typically costs more than transactions in which clients are providing liquidity on an execution venue), more settlement tickets processed and higher costs from outsourcing the clearing of select accounts to a third party. These factors, along with the impact of our lower average revenue per share, increased transaction processing costs as a percentage of commissions and fees to 21.2% from 17.8% in 2014.\nOther expenses decreased $3.5 million due to a higher credit for research and development costs charged to other segments as more of these resources have been centralized in the U.S., along with lower depreciation and software amortization.\nCanadian Operations\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>$ in thousands\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>49,169 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>59,992 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(10,823 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(18 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recurring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,012 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(42 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,605 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(19 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,823 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(16 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(927 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,239 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(12 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,989 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(13 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>10,643 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>17,259 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(6,616 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(38 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrency translation from a weaker Canadian Dollar decreased total Canadian revenues and expenses by $9.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease of $2.6 million to pre-tax income.\nCanadian commissions and fees were down 18% as the impact of the SEC Settlement and a weaker Canadian dollar offset strong trading levels in the early part of the year.

These decreases were slightly offset by higher market data costs.\nEuropean Operations\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>$ in thousands\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>113,633 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>113,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(355 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recurring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(176 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(502 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(65 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>28,244 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>34,081 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(5,837 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(17 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrency translation from a weaker British Pound decreased European revenues and expenses by $10.1 million and $7.9 million, respectively, diminishing pre-tax income by $2.2 million.\nEuropean results in 2015 include the results of ITG RFQ-hub for a full year versus five months in 2014 following the July 30, 2014 acquisition date.\nOur European commissions and fees were flat with 2014 despite an unfavorable currency impact of $8.9 million and a lower average commission rate primarily due to an increase in sell-side clients trading in POSIT and an increase in institutional clients using our trading algorithms. While the growth in our value traded was nearly twice the growth rate of overall European value traded, an increased portion was from sell-side clients. Although we earn a lower commission rate on sell-side trading, this activity produces incremental profitability, uses excess capacity and grows the liquidity in POSIT.\nRecurring revenue increased primarily from a full period of ITG RFQ-hub activity as compared to only five months in 2014 as well as an increase in billed analytics revenue. Other revenues improved due to a lower impact of trade errors and client accommodations.\nCompensation and benefits increased due to higher salaries from a full period of ITG RFQ-hub, investments in our sales team and higher deferred stock-based compensation associated with awards granted for 2014 and 2013.\nTransaction processing costs increased as a result of an increase in the average daily notional value traded. As a percentage of commissions and fees, transaction processing costs increased to 26.3% from 23.5% in 2014 due to the impact of a higher proportion of value traded by lower-rate, sell-side clients.\nOther expenses increased due to higher charges for global research and development costs, increases in business development and customer connectivity costs and a full period of costs from

by $2.5 million.\nAsia Pacific commissions and fees increased despite unfavorable currency translation and the impact of the SEC Settlement in the second half of 2015 due to strong order flow earlier in the year by U.S. clients and local Asian clients trading into Australia and Hong Kong and the increased use of our trading algorithms and our POSIT Alert block crossing system.\nRecurring revenues decreased primarily from lower revenue earned from global connections due to a change in our attribution method and currency translation. Other revenues improved due to lower client accommodations and errors.\nCompensation and employee benefits decreased due to lower headcount, reduced severance charges and favorable currency translation.\nTransaction processing costs decreased due to a higher proportion of our trading in markets where our costs are lower. As a percentage of commissions and fees, these costs declined to 24.2% from 25.7% in 2014.\nOther expenses increased primarily because of the higher charges for global research and development costs, higher software amortization and consulting expenses.\nCorporate\nCorporate activity includes investment income and other gains as well as costs not associated with operating the businesses within our regional segments. These costs include, among others, (a) the costs of being a public company, such as certain staff costs, a portion of external audit fees, and reporting, filing and listing costs, (b) intangible asset amortization, (c) interest expense, (d) professional fees associated with our global transfer pricing structure, (e) foreign exchange gains or losses and (f) certain non-operating expenses.\nFor 2015, we reported pre-tax income from Corporate activity of $64.7 million, reflecting the $107.7 million gain on the Energy Research Sale, $0.9 million of investment income and $43.9 million of costs. For 2014, we incurred a pre-tax loss from Corporate activity of $20.5 million, reflecting\ninvestment income of $1.3 million and costs of $21.8 million. The $22.1 million increase in costs reflected the $20.3 million cost for the SEC Settlement and related legal and other fees of $4.9 million, offset in part by $2.1 million of reductions in compensation and benefits from the executive changes announced in August 2015 and lower intangible amortization costs due to the full amortization of certain assets.\nConsolidated income tax expense\nOur effective tax rate was 24.5% for 2015 compared to 21.7% for 2014. The low rate in 2015 primarily reflected the impact of a low tax rate on the Energy Research Sale from the availability of a deductible basis that was mostly written-off for book purposes in 2012, significant income generated in Europe where we are taxed at a lower rate and profitability generated in Asia Pacific where we are not incurring a tax cost due to the availability of net operating losses. These impacts were partially offset by a tax expense of $6.5 million on a deemed dividend associated with an amendment to the capital structure of our operations outside North America. The low rate in 2014 reflects the impact of strong earnings from Europe, where we are taxed at a lower rate, and a $2.7 million tax benefit arising from settling multi-year tax return positions offset by establishing additional reserves for other tax positions. Our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.\nResults of Operation-Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nAs noted above, effective in the first quarter of 2015, the Company is presenting its regional segment results excluding the impact of corporate activity.

While we also saw lower revenue per share from sell-side clients, we continued to see improvement in the revenue per share from buy-side clients.\nThe higher revenue per share from buy-side clients was driven by higher rates for clients' use of our POSIT Alert block crossing system and our high-touch and portfolio trading services.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>U.S. Operations: Key Indicators*\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total trading volume (in billions of shares)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average trading volume per day (in millions of shares)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.0047 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.0047 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. market trading days\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*Excludes activity from ITG Net commission share arrangements.\nRecurring revenues decreased due to the impact of client attrition from our OMS product, resulting in lower OMS subscription revenues and connectivity fees, partially offset by higher research subscriptions.\nOther revenues increased primarily due to an increase in transaction advisory services revenues generated by our energy research team. This increase more than offset a reduction in revenues generated by our stock loan matched book business, which included a gain of $2.5 million in 2013 related to adjustments to historical dividend withholdings.\nCompensation and employee benefits increased as a result of headcount increases and from higher incentive-based compensation to our management team associated with increased global profitability.\nTransaction processing costs declined more than the decrease in commissions and fees due to lower options volumes, which incur higher costs proportionally than our cash equity trading and lower execution costs from client use of our algorithm technology. As a percentage of commissions and fees, transaction processing costs declined to 17.8% from 18.2% during 2013.\nOther expenses decreased $12.4 million, reflecting lower data center, data and connectivity expenses from our cost reduction initiatives and lower depreciation, software amortization and consulting fees. There was also a higher credit for research and development costs charged to other segments. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in employee recruiting and legal fees.\nCanadian Operations\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

million, respectively, resulting in a decrease of $1.4 million to pre-tax income.\nCanadian commissions and fees increased $2.5 million despite an unfavorable currency translation of $4.0 million, principally due to the growth in MATCH Now volumes of more than 80%.\nRecurring revenues increased due to a higher number of billable network connections through ITG Net and our billing for market data consumed by clients.\nOther revenues increased slightly due to an increase in income earned on foreign exchange transactions and principal arbitrage trading, partially offset by losses on client accommodations and the impact of currency translation.\nCompensation and employee benefits costs decreased primarily due to the impact of currency translation and a decrease in share-based compensation, which fluctuates for legacy awards to Canadian employees based on the changes in the market price of our stock, partially offset by an increase in incentive-based compensation related to increased profitability.\nTransaction processing costs decreased due to lower rates for clearing and settlement from contract renegotiation with our clearing provider, lower execution costs as a higher percentage of our volume was executed in MATCH Now and the impact of currency translation. As a percentage of commission and fees, transaction processing costs declined to 16.2% from 18.6% in 2013.\nThe decrease in other expenses was primarily driven by lower connectivity expenses and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by higher charges for historical market data and legal-related expenses.\nEuropean Operations\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>$ in thousands\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>113,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>79,639 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>34,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recurring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(502 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(547 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,983 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction processing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>34,081 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>20,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>14,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrency translation from a stronger average British Pound increased European revenues and expenses by $6.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively, adding $1.6 million to pre-tax income.\nEuropean results include substantially all the ITG RFQ-hub operations since the July 30, 2014 acquisition date, adding $2.0 million in revenues, mostly recurring, and $2.2 million in expenses.\nOur European commissions and fees grew 43% in 2014 as compared to 2013, far outpacing the 16% growth in market-wide value traded. The investments we made in our infrastructure and our product suite resulted in increased activity from buy-side and sell-side clients using our electronic\nbrokerage offerings, including our trading algorithms and POSIT, and from clients using our POSIT Alert block crossing system. We also saw increased commissions from the use of our high-touch trading services. Commissions and fees also benefitted from $5.9 million in favorable currency translation.\nRecurring revenues increased primarily from the new connectivity revenue from ITG RFQ-hub.\nCompensation and employee benefits increased due to higher incentive-based compensation related to improved performance, increase in headcount, including employees from the ITG RFQ-hub acquisition, and the impact of the unfavorable currency translation of $1.7 million. This increase was offset, in part, by $3.1 million in lower compensation associated with the outsourcing of our research and development facility in Israel to a third-party service provider.\nTransaction processing costs increased due to the significant increase in value traded. However, transaction processing costs declined as a percentage of commissions and fees to 23.5% from 24.6% in 2013 due to the impact of a higher percentage of our value traded crossed in POSIT, including our POSIT Alert block crossing system, and our initiatives to reduce settlement and clearing costs.\nOther expenses increased due to higher charges for (a) global research and development costs, (b) historical market data, (c) consulting costs, net of capitalization, attributable to the outsourcing of our research and development facility in Israel to a third-party service provider, (d) marketing costs and (e) the additional costs added by ITG RFQ-hub.\nAsia Pacific Operations\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

impact on our pre-tax loss.\nAsia Pacific commissions and fees increased despite a reduction in market-wide trading activity and unfavorable currency translation due to the growth in commissions from clients using our POSIT Alert block crossing system and algorithmic trading capabilities as well as from higher commission-sharing revenues.\nThe growth in recurring revenues primarily reflects growth in the number of billable network connections through ITG Net and the decrease in other revenues is due to higher client trade accommodations, which totaled $1.2 million in 2014, compared to $0.3 million in 2013.\nCompensation and employee benefits increased due to increases in headcount and employee termination charges, partially offset by higher capitalized compensation for software development and favorable currency translation.\nTransaction processing costs decreased due to a reduction in value traded and our efforts to reduce execution and settlement costs. As a percentage of commissions and fees, transaction processing costs declined to 25.7% from 28.6% in 2013.\nThe increase in other expenses reflects higher charges for historical market data and global research and development, as well as increases in hardware and software maintenance and connectivity, partially offset by reductions in market data costs.\nCorporate\nFor 2014, we incurred a pre-tax loss from Corporate activity of $20.5 million, reflecting investment income of $1.3 million and costs of $21.8 million. For 2013, we incurred a pre-tax loss from Corporate activity of $25.9 million, reflecting investment income of $1.5 million and costs of $27.4 million. Corporate costs in 2013 included $2.6 million of duplicate rent charges associated with the build out of our new headquarters in lower Manhattan while we still occupied our then-existing headquarters in midtown Manhattan, a $3.9 million charge related to our office move, including a reserve for the remaining lease obligation and a $1.5 million restructuring charge to close our technology research and development facility in Israel. These costs were partially offset by a $1.3 million reversal of previously-recorded 2012 and 2011 restructuring liabilities as a portion of the space vacated in our Los Angeles office was sub-let and certain legal and other employee-related accruals were deemed unnecessary.\nConsolidated income tax expense\nOur effective tax rate was 21.7% for 2014 compared to 27.8% for 2013. The low rate in both periods is the result of a significantly higher proportion of our pre-tax income arising from our European Operations, which is taxed at a lower rate. Additionally, in the U.S. we recorded a $2.7 million tax benefit in 2014 for the net impact of settling multi-year tax return positions and establishing additional reserves for other tax positions. In 2013, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the resolution of a tax contingency in Europe and the recognition of the full-year 2012 research and experimentation credit in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2013 due to the timing of tax legislation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Our liquidity requirements result from our working capital needs, which include clearing and settlement activities, as well as our regulatory capital needs. A substantial portion of our assets is liquid, consisting of cash and cash equivalents or assets readily convertible into cash. Cash is principally invested in U.S. government money market mutual funds and other money market mutual funds. At December 31, 2015, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $330.7 million. Included in this amount is $117.1 million of cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside the United States. Due to the December 2015 amendment to the capital structure of our operations outside of North America, which included a deemed dividend on all cumulative undistributed earnings, we currently do not foresee a need to repatriate funds from certain foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. by way of additional dividends. Should we need to do so in the future, our effective tax rate may increase. As a self-clearing broker-dealer in the U.S., we are subject to cash deposit requirements with clearing organizations that may be large in relation to total liquid assets and may fluctuate significantly based upon the nature and size of customers' trading activity and market volatility. At December 31, 2015, we had interest-bearing\nsecurity deposits totaling $23.3 million with clearing organizations in the U.S. for the settlement of equity trades. In the normal course of our U.S. settlement activities, we may also need to temporarily finance customer securities positions from short settlements or delivery failures. These financings may be funded from existing cash resources, borrowings under stock loan transactions or short-term bank loans under our committed facility. In January 2016, we entered into a new $150 million 364-day revolving credit agreement (the \"New Credit Agreement\") with a syndicate of banks and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The terms and conditions of the New Credit Agreement are similar to the credit agreement that matured in January 2016 (see Note 14, Borrowings, and Note 24, Subsequent Events), except that the unused commitment fee is 0.75%.\nWe self-clear equity trades in Hong Kong and Australia, maintaining restricted cash deposits of $26.0 million primarily to support overdraft facilities and we had deposits with clearing organizations of $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. In Europe, we maintain $1.6 million in restricted cash related to protected client funds and we had deposits with our clearing and settlement agents of $41.9 million at December 31, 2015.\nWe expect our cash balance to decline in the first quarter of 2016 as we make tax payments related to the gain from the Energy Research Sale and certain restructurings we have completed, as well as upon payment of incentive compensation for 2015.\nCapital Resources\nCapital resource requirements relate to capital purchases, as well as business investments, and are generally funded from operations. When required, as in the case of a major acquisition, our strong cash generating ability has historically allowed us to access U.S. capital markets.\nOperating Activities\nThe table below summarizes the effect of the major components of operating cash flow.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>91,570 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>50,892 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>31,085 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of energy business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(107,699 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash items included in net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,898 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of changes in receivables/payables from/to customers and brokers\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34,627 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,274 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of changes in other working capital and operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,129 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>67,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,517 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>48,746 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>142,540 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>45,192 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2015 was driven by lower adjusted net income (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The 2014 increase was driven by strong net income and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nIn the normal course of our clearing and settlement activities worldwide, cash is typically used to fund restricted or segregated cash accounts (under regulations and otherwise), broker and customer fails to deliver/receive, securities borrowed, deposits with clearing organizations and net activity related to receivables/payables from/to customers and brokers. The cash requirements vary from day to day depending on volume transacted and customer trading patterns.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities of $73.3 million includes the net proceeds from the Energy Research Sale, partially offset by investments in software development projects and computer hardware and software.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $58.6 million primarily reflects repurchases of ITG common stock, our dividend program, shares withheld for net settlements of share-based awards and repayments of long-term debt, offset by net proceeds from short-term bank borrowings that are used to support our settlement activities.\nDuring 2015, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $51.0 million, which was funded from our available cash resources. Of these shares, 2.0 million were purchased under our Board of Directors' authorization for a total cost of $42.0 million. An additional 0.4 million shares ($9.0 million) pertained solely to the satisfaction of minimum statutory withholding tax upon the net settlement of equity awards. As of December 31, 2015, the total remaining number of shares currently available for repurchase under ITG's stock repurchase program was 2.8 million. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions and other factors. We may elect to conduct future share repurchases through open market purchases, private transactions or automatic share repurchase programs under SEC Rule 10b5-1.\nIn April 2015, our Board of Directors initiated a dividend program under which we began to pay quarterly dividends, subject to quarterly declarations by the Board of Directors. During 2015, our Board of Directors declared and we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per share in each of the second, third and fourth quarters totaling $7.0 million, in the aggregate.\nRegulatory Capital\nITG Inc., AlterNet and ITG Derivatives are subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. ITG Inc. has elected to use the alternative method permitted by Rule 15c3-1, which requires that ITG Inc. maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of $1.0 million or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions, as defined. AlterNet and ITG Derivatives have elected to use the basic method permitted by Rule 15c3-1, which requires that they each maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of 62/3% of aggregate indebtedness or $100,000 and $1.0 million, respectively. Dividends or withdrawals of capital cannot be made if capital is needed to comply with regulatory requirements.\nNet capital balances and the amounts in excess of required net capital at December 31, 2015 for the U.S. Operations are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>U.S. Operations\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Net Capital </th> <th> </th> <th>Excess </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ITG Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>91,360 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>90,360 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AlterNet\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ITG Derivatives\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, ITG Inc. had $7.3 million of cash in a Special Reserve Bank Account for the benefit of customers under the Customer Protection Rule pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3-3, Computation for Determination of Reserve Requirements and $2.5 million under agreements for proprietary accounts of broker-dealers.\nIn addition, our Canadian, European and Asia Pacific Operations have subsidiaries with regulatory capital requirements. The regulatory net capital balances and amount of regulatory capital in excess of\nthe minimum requirements applicable to each business at December 31, 2015, is summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands):\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Canadian Operations\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Net Capital </th> <th> </th> <th>Excess </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCanada\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>24,879 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>24,519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEuropean Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIreland\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,481 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.K.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,502 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsia Pacific Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAustralia\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hong Kong\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,296 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSingapore\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>427 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Outlook\nHistorically, our working capital, stock repurchase, dividend program and investment activity requirements have been funded from cash from operations and short-term loans, with the exception of strategic acquisitions, which at times have required long-term financing. We believe that our cash flow from operations, existing cash balances and our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating cash and regulatory capital needs, while also complying with the terms of the New Credit Agreement. However, our ability to borrow additional funds may be impacted by financial lending institutions' ability or willingness to lend to us on commercially acceptable terms.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nWe are a member of various U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges and clearing houses that trade and clear, respectively, equities and/or derivative contracts. Associated with our membership, we may be required to pay a proportionate share of financial obligations of another member who may default on its obligations to the exchanges or the clearing house. While the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships vary, in general, our guarantee obligations would arise only if the exchange had previously exhausted its resources. The maximum potential payout under these memberships cannot be estimated. We have not recorded any contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for these agreements and believe that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments amounted to $184.7 million in the aggregate and consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments due by period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Contractual obligations\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1-3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>3-5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase of goods and services\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>40,798 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>33,909 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,992 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>897 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,711 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum payments under certain employment arrangements(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>184,726 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,369 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>34,005 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>20,386 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>67,966 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Pursuant to employment arrangements, in the event of termination of employment without cause on December 31, 2015, we would be obligated to pay separation payments totaling $5.5 million.\nThe above information excludes $15.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits discussed in Note 9, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements, because it is not possible to estimate the time period when, or if, it might be paid to tax authorities.\nAs part of the $150 million, 364-day credit agreement we entered into in January 2016, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.75% on any unborrowed amounts.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented and will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard provides companies with a single five step revenue recognition model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The standard will also require significant additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures describing the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt ASU 2014-09. The original standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, however, in April 2015, the FASB proposed a one-year deferral of this standard, with a new effective date of December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the impact of adoption on its financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In many instances, the application of such principles requires management to make estimates or to apply subjective principles to particular facts and circumstances. A change in the estimates or a variance in the application, or interpretation of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. could yield a materially different accounting result. Below is a summary of our critical accounting estimates where we believe that the estimations, judgments or interpretations that we made, if different, would have yielded the most significant differences in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill Impairment: Testing Methodology and Valuation Considerations\nWe obtained goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of certain of our subsidiaries. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired. We are required to periodically assess whether any of our goodwill is impaired. In order to do this, we apply judgment in determining our reporting units, which represent our business segments. Our annual goodwill impairment assessment involves assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the results of our qualitative analysis suggests that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss using a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment testing process is as follows:\n\u2022 Step one-the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value in order to identify potential impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit, potential impairment is indicated at the reporting unit level and step two of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and measure the potential impairment loss.\n\u2022 Step two-when potential impairment is indicated in step one, we compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit's tangible and (non-goodwill) intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination. Any excess in the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization\nIntangible assets with definite useful lives are subject to amortization and are evaluated for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an intangible asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. If such an event or change occurs, we estimate cash flows directly associated with the use of the intangible asset to test its recoverability and assess its remaining useful life. The projected cash flows require assumptions related to revenue growth, operating margins and other relevant market, economic and regulatory factors. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of a finite-lived intangible asset or asset group are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset, we then compare the carrying amount to its current fair value. We estimate the fair value using market prices for similar assets, if available, or by using a discounted cash flow model. We then recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.\nShare-Based Compensation\nIn accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, share-based payment transactions require the application of a fair value methodology that involves various assumptions. The fair value of options awarded is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the following assumptions: expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common stock price and expected dividend yield. We estimate the expected life of the\noptions using historical data and the volatility of our common stock is estimated based on a combination of the historical volatility and the implied volatility from traded options. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards with a market condition is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation is an iterative technique designed to estimate future payouts by taking into account our current stock price, the volatility of our common stock, risk-free rates, and a risk-neutral valuation methodology.\nAlthough both models meet the requirements of ASC 718, the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of the underlying awards, as it does not consider other factors important to those share-based compensation awards, such as continued employment, periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability.\nContingencies and Uncertainties\nThe use of estimates is important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation, mediation, arbitration, regulatory proceedings and various contingencies and uncertainties. Our accounting for contingencies and uncertainties follows the guidance prescribed under ASC 450, Contingencies, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. We review the status of each significant matter and evaluate its potential financial exposure on a regular basis. If the potential loss from any exposure is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainties in the evaluation process, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time, so actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision. As additional information becomes available, our reassessment of the potential liability may lead to a revision in our estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the company's results of operations for any particular period.\nIncome Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions\nASC 740, Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance may be recorded against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or results of operations.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit for each such position that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits. Such estimates involve interpretations of regulations, rulings, case law, etc. and are inherently complex. Our estimates may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes as resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions typically would not be known for several years after completion of any fiscal year. The impact of our reassessment of uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto.\nOverview\nITG is an independent broker and financial technology firm that improves the efficiency and execution quality of institutional trading. ITG helps clients understand market trends, mitigate risk and navigate increasingly complex markets. A leader in electronic trading since launching the POSIT crossing network in 1987, ITG takes a consultative approach in delivering the highest quality execution and liquidity solutions along with analytical tools and research. The firm is headquartered in New York with offices in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region.\nOur business is organized into four reportable operating segments (see Note 22, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements):\n\u2022 U.S. Operations\n\u2022 Canadian Operations\n\u2022 European Operations\n\u2022 Asia Pacific Operations\nOur four operating segments provide the following types of products and services:\n\u2022 Electronic Brokerage-includes self-directed trading by clients using algorithms, smart routing and matching through POSIT in cash equities (including single stocks and portfolio lists), futures and options;\n\u2022 Research, Sales and Trading-includes (a) differentiated, unbiased, data-driven equity research through the use of innovative data harvesting and analysis and (b) portfolio trading and high-touch trading desks providing execution expertise and trading ideas based on investment research;\n\u2022 Platforms-includes trade order and execution management software applications in addition to network connectivity; and\n\u2022 Analytics-includes (a) tools enabling portfolio managers and traders to improve pre-trade and real-time execution performance, (b) portfolio construction and optimization decisions and (c) securities valuation.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2015, the Company is presenting its regional segment results excluding the impact of corporate activity. For this purpose, corporate activity includes investment income and other gains as well as costs not associated with operating the businesses within the Company's regional segments. These costs include, among others, (a) the costs of being a public company, such as certain staff costs, a portion of external audit fees, and reporting, filing and listing costs, (b) intangible asset amortization, (c) interest expense, (d) professional fees associated with our global transfer pricing structure, (e) foreign exchange gains or losses and (f) certain non-operating expenses. Prior to this change in segment measure, corporate activity was included in the region where the income/expense was earned/incurred, which primarily was in the U.S. Operations segment. Prior period segment data has been restated to conform to the 2015 presentation.\nSources of Revenues\nRevenues from our products and services are generated from commissions and fees, recurring (subscriptions) and other sources.\nCommissions and fees are derived primarily from (i) commissions charged for trade execution services, (ii) income generated on net executions, whereby equity orders are filled at different prices within or at the National Best Bid and Offer (\"NBBO\") and (iii) commission sharing arrangements between ITG Net (our private value-added FIX-based financial electronic communications network) and third-party brokers and alternative trading systems whose trading products are made available to our clients on our order management system (\"OMS\") and execution management system (\"EMS\") applications in addition to commission sharing arrangements for our ITG Single Ticket Clearing Service and our ITG RFQ-hub request-for-quote service. Because commissions are earned on a per-transaction basis, such revenues fluctuate from period to period depending on (a) the volume of securities traded through our services in the U.S. and Canada, (b) the contract value of securities traded in Europe and the Asia Pacific region and (c) our commission rates. Certain factors that affect our volumes and contract values traded include: (i) macro trends in the global equities markets that affect overall institutional equity trading activity, (ii) competitive pressure, including pricing, created by a proliferation of electronic execution competitors and (iii) potential changes in market structure in the U.S. and other regions. In addition to share volume, revenues from net executions are also impacted by the width of spreads within the NBBO. Trade orders are delivered to us from our OMS and EMS products and other vendors' products, direct computer-to-computer links to customers through ITG Net and third-party networks and phone orders from our customers.\nRecurring revenues are derived from the following primary sources: (i) connectivity fees generated through ITG Net for the ability of the sell-side to receive orders from, and send indications of interest\nto, the buy-side and for the sell-side to receive requests-for-quotes through ITG RFQ-hub, (ii) subscription revenue generated from providing research, (iii) software and analytical products and services and (iv) maintenance and customer technical support for ITG OMS.\nOther revenues include: (1) income from principal trading in the Company's Canadian Operations, including arbitrage trading, (2) the net spread on foreign exchange transactions executed on a principal basis to facilitate equity trades by clients in different currencies, as well as on other foreign currency transactions unrelated to equity trading, (3) the net interest spread earned on securities borrowed and loaned matched book transactions, (4) transaction advisory services provided to potential purchasers of energy-related investments, (5) non-recurring consulting services, such as one-time implementation and customer-training-related activities, (6) investment and interest income, (7) interest income on securities borrowed in connection with customers' settlement activities, (8) market gains/losses resulting from temporary positions in securities assumed in the normal course of agency trading (including client errors and accommodations) and (9) non-recurring gains and losses such as divestitures.\nExpenses\nCompensation and employee benefits, our largest expense, consist of salaries and wages, incentive compensation, employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation fluctuates based on revenues, profitability and other measures, taking into account the landscape for key talent. Incentive compensation includes a combination of cash and deferred share-based awards. Only the cash portion of incentive compensation is a variable expense in the current period. As a result, our ratio of compensation expense to revenues may fluctuate from period-to-period based on revenue levels.\nTransaction processing expense consists of costs to access various third-party execution destinations and to process, clear and settle transactions. These costs tend to fluctuate with share and trade volumes, the mix of trade execution services used by clients and the rates charged by third parties.\nOccupancy and equipment expense consists primarily of rent and utilities related to leased premises, office equipment and depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and leasehold improvements.\nTelecommunications and data processing expenses primarily consist of costs for obtaining market data, data associated with our investment research offerings, telecommunications services and systems maintenance.\nOther general and administrative expenses primarily include software amortization, consulting, business development, professional fees and intangible asset amortization.\nInterest expense consists primarily of costs associated with outstanding debt and credit facilities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"), management uses certain \"non-GAAP financial measures\" as such term is defined in SEC Regulation G. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in, or excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations, and therefore a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone. In addition, management believes the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results as the items described below reflect certain unique and/or non-operating items\nsuch as acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring charges, large write-offs or items outside of management's control.\nAdjusted revenues, adjusted expenses and adjusted net income together with related per share amounts are non-GAAP performance measures that we believe are useful to assist investors in gaining an understanding of the trends and operating results for our core business. These measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, results reported under U.S. GAAP.\nReconciliations of adjusted revenues, adjusted expenses and adjusted net income to revenues, expenses and net income and related per share amounts as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013 are provided below, as applicable (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts). There were no such adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\n\n(1)In December 2015, we completed the sale of the subsidiaries conducting our energy research business to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus, a global private equity firm, for $120.5 million. The pre-tax gain of $107.7 million is net of a working capital adjustment on the closing balance sheet, direct costs related to the sale, including share-based compensation costs, and the carrying value of the net assets disposed.\n(2)In August 2015, we reached a final settlement with the SEC to pay an aggregate amount of $20.3 million in connection with the SEC's investigation into a proprietary trading pilot operated in 2010 and 2011. During 2015, we incurred $4.9 million in legal and related costs associated with this matter.\n(3)In December 2015, we amended the capital structure of our principal holding company outside North America to provide continued flexibility for the movement of global capital. This amendment accelerated the U.S. taxation of amounts earned outside of North America resulting in a tax charge of $6.5 million.\n(4)In the second quarter of 2013, we incurred a $1.6 million charge to implement a restructuring plan to close our technology research and development facility in Israel and migrate that function to an outsourced-service-provider model effective January 1, 2014. This plan primarily focused on reducing costs by limiting our geographic footprint while maintaining the necessary technological expertise via a consulting arrangement. This restructuring plan triggered the recognition of a tax charge of $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2013 associated with the anticipated withdrawal of capital from Israel. We also reduced previously-recorded 2012 and 2011 restructuring accruals of $1.6 million to reflect the sub-lease of previously-vacated office space and certain legal and other employee-related charges deemed unnecessary.\n(5)During the fourth quarter of 2012, we began to build out and ready our new lower Manhattan headquarters while continuing to occupy our then-existing headquarters in midtown Manhattan and as a result incurred duplicate rent charges through June 2013.\n(6)In the second quarter of 2013, we moved into our new headquarters and incurred a one-time non-operating charge, which included a reserve for the remaining lease obligation for the previous midtown Manhattan headquarters.\nExecutive Summary for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nConsolidated Overview\nOur 2015 results reflect the significant negative impact on our business from the SEC Settlement in August 2015. Immediately following the preliminary announcement of the SEC Settlement in late July, we experienced a sharp drop in trading activity as a number of clients either suspended or significantly reduced the amount of trade flow sent to ITG. Management has worked actively to reassure clients of the integrity of our business through face-to-face meetings and due diligence processes that have resulted in substantially all of our clients resuming some level of trading with ITG. Average daily trading commissions in the U.S. during the fourth quarter were 12% better than the lows of August and September with buy-side trading activity showing signs of stabilization. While the momentum in our recovery has been consistent, the full restoration of our business remains a work in progress.\nOur 2015 results also include the December sale of our energy research business to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus, a global private equity firm, for $120.5 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $107.7 million and an after-tax gain of $91.4 million, or $2.66 per share (\"Energy Research Sale\"). Having monetized the significant value in the energy research business, we are currently evaluating alternatives for the use of the net proceeds. Based on 2015 results, the Energy Research Sale is expected to reduce annual revenues by approximately $20 million and reduce annual expenses by approximately $6 million, net of a new licensing charge to distribute the energy research product to our trading clients.\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis, we earned net income of $91.6 million, or $2.63 per diluted share in 2015. Our U.S. GAAP results include the gain from the Energy Research Sale as well as $25.2 million in costs related to the SEC Settlement and a $6.5 million tax charge to amend the capital structure of our operations outside of North America. This capital structure amendment will provide continued flexibility with the movement of global capital without incremental tax costs. Adjusted net income (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) was $29.8 million, or $0.86 per diluted share compared to $50.9 million, or $1.40 per diluted share for 2014, due primarily to a 6% reduction in revenues, excluding the gain on the Energy Research Sale. Expenses of $513.6 million were 4% higher than 2014 while adjusted expenses (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) of $488.4 million, which excluded the costs related to the SEC Settlement, decreased 1% from the prior year. The reduction in expenses was largely driven by lower compensation costs from compensation reversals associated with the management changes announced in August, mark-to-market adjustments on stock awards to Canadian employees that will be settled in cash and lower revenues and profitability. Costs were also lowered as compared to 2014 due to the exchange rate impact from the stronger U.S. Dollar.\nSegment Discussions\nRegional segment results exclude the impact of corporate activity. In 2015, corporate activity increased pre-tax income by $64.7 million on a U.S. GAAP basis and decreased pre-tax income by $17.8 million on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the Energy Research Sale and the costs related to the SEC Settlement. In 2014, corporate activity reduced pre-tax income by $20.5 million.\nU.S. commission revenues were 9% lower in 2015 reflecting the sharp drop in our customer trading activity following the SEC Settlement. Our U.S. average daily volume was 162.2 million shares, virtually flat with 2014, trailing the 8% growth in U.S. consolidated daily market volume. Although our total volumes were relatively unchanged, a larger portion of our volumes were from sell-side accounts\ndue in part to our efforts to grow this business. Sell-side trading volume increased to 59% of overall volume, compared to 52% in 2014, diluting our overall revenue capture rate per share to $0.0043 compared to $0.0047 in 2014.\nIn Canada, commissions and fees were down 18% as sharply lower business levels in the fourth quarter following the SEC Settlement and a 14% reduction in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate offset a strong start to the year. MATCH Now's volume grew by more than 30% during 2015.\nOur European business has held up well in the wake of our SEC Settlement, although growth in our trading activity was offset by a 7% decline in the average British Pound exchange rate. In local currency terms, market-wide trading activity was up nearly 16%, according to BATS Global Markets Inc., driven by increased market volatility during the first half of the year. In comparison, the value traded by ITG Europe grew 30% in local currency terms and 20% in U.S. Dollar terms. While growth in our value traded in Europe exceeded market growth, like the U.S., a greater portion was from sell-side accounts. We continued our strategy of growing the liquidity on our platform by expanding our sell-side client business and our business across continental Europe, which enabled us to capitalize on the improved market activity.\nThe last two quarters in 2015 were challenging periods for our Asia Pacific business. After a strong first half of the year, when we achieved record profitability in both the first and second quarters, our Asia Pacific business struggled in the last two quarters following the SEC Settlement. Much of the decline is due to a drop-off in trading activity by U.S. based clients in the wake of the SEC Settlement. While the reduction in commissions in the second half of the year ended our run of four consecutive quarters of profitability, we were still able to generate a pre-tax profit of $1.6 million in 2015 compared to a pre-tax loss of $1.7 million in 2014 due to a 3% growth in revenues and a 4% reduction in costs from cost savings initiatives implemented in late 2014.\nCapital Resource Allocation\nDuring 2015, we repurchased 2.0 million shares under our stock repurchase program for $42.0 million. We intend to continue to use share repurchases to offset dilution from the issuance of stock under employee compensation plans and to opportunistically return capital to stockholders, depending on market conditions and any strategic activity that may necessitate alternative uses of capital. We may elect to conduct future share repurchases through open market purchases, private transactions or automatic share repurchase programs under SEC Rule 10b5-1.\nIn April 2015, our Board of Directors initiated a dividend program under which we began to pay quarterly dividends, subject to quarterly declarations by the Board of Directors. During 2015, our Board of Directors declared and we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per share in each of the second, third and fourth quarters totaling $7.0 million, in the aggregate.\nResults of Operations-Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nU.S. Operations\n\nWhile total annual volumes were essentially unchanged, commissions and fees decreased 9% reflecting the higher proportion of average daily volumes executed by lower-priced sell-side clients, which increased to 59% of our volumes compared to 52% in 2014, adversely impacting our revenue per share. Following the SEC Settlement we saw a decline in trading activity from some buy-side clients that either suspended trading or significantly reduced the amount of trade flow sent to ITG. While substantially all of the accounts that suspended trading with ITG have resumed sending some level of trade flow, much work remains to bring all of our clients back to the level of engagement we experienced prior to the SEC Settlement. This decline in buy-side trade flow also had a negative impact on sell-side activity as there was less liquidity in POSIT, resulting in fewer crossing opportunities.\n\n*Excludes activity from ITG Net commission share arrangements.\nRecurring revenues increased due to higher research subscriptions in addition to higher connectivity fees. Connectivity fees increased primarily from an increase in revenue from global connections previously recorded in our Canadian and Asia Pacific Operations segments, as a result of a change in our attribution method, and an increase in revenue from connections delivered out of the ITG PM solution. These increases in connectivity revenue were partially offset by connections lost due to the impact of client attrition from our OMS product. Research subscriptions increased from higher subscription revenues from new accounts subscribing to our investment research products and a shift in the recognition of certain corporate subscriptions revenue in energy research to the U.S. Operations segment from the Canadian Operations segment, partially offset by the impact of the discontinuation of our healthcare market research business in May 2015. The Energy Research Sale is expected to reduce recurring revenues in the U.S. Operations segment by approximately $18 million in 2016.\nOther revenues decreased primarily due to declines in transaction advisory services revenues from our energy research team and lower net revenue earned from stock loan matched book transactions.\nCompensation and employee benefits costs decreased as a result of lower incentive-based compensation to our management team associated with global profitability levels and with lower headcount at the end of the year. As a percentage of revenues, compensation costs increased to 45.1% as compared to 42.4% in 2014 due to the impact of the fixed components of compensation costs on lower revenues and our need to retain staff during this challenging period.\nTransaction processing costs increased due to an increase in the proportion of trading by clients where liquidity was taken (which typically costs more than transactions in which clients are providing liquidity on an execution venue), more settlement tickets processed and higher costs from outsourcing the clearing of select accounts to a third party. These factors, along with the impact of our lower average revenue per share, increased transaction processing costs as a percentage of commissions and fees to 21.2% from 17.8% in 2014.\nOther expenses decreased $3.5 million due to a higher credit for research and development costs charged to other segments as more of these resources have been centralized in the U.S., along with lower depreciation and software amortization.\nCanadian Operations\n\nCurrency translation from a weaker Canadian Dollar decreased total Canadian revenues and expenses by $9.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease of $2.6 million to pre-tax income.\nCanadian commissions and fees were down 18% as the impact of the SEC Settlement and a weaker Canadian dollar offset strong trading levels in the early part of the year. MATCH Now's volume grew by more than 30% during 2015.\nRecurring revenues decreased primarily from lower revenue from global connections due to a change in our attribution method and from a shift in the recognition of energy research subscription revenue from corporate accounts to the U.S. Operations segment.\nOther revenues increased due to higher principal trading gains on inter-listed arbitrage trading.\nCompensation and employee benefits costs decreased due to currency translation and lower incentive compensation.\nTransaction processing costs decreased due to the favorable impact from currency translation of $1.3 million, partially offset by higher costs associated with increased principal trading activity and higher execution charges on shares traded in the U.S. by Canadian clients.\nOther expenses were down due to the impact of currency translation as well as reductions to facilities costs, consulting fees and research distribution fees paid to the U.S. Operations. These decreases were slightly offset by higher market data costs.\nEuropean Operations\n\nCurrency translation from a weaker British Pound decreased European revenues and expenses by $10.1 million and $7.9 million, respectively, diminishing pre-tax income by $2.2 million.\nEuropean results in 2015 include the results of ITG RFQ-hub for a full year versus five months in 2014 following the July 30, 2014 acquisition date.\nOur European commissions and fees were flat with 2014 despite an unfavorable currency impact of $8.9 million and a lower average commission rate primarily due to an increase in sell-side clients trading in POSIT and an increase in institutional clients using our trading algorithms. While the growth in our value traded was nearly twice the growth rate of overall European value traded, an increased portion was from sell-side clients. Although we earn a lower commission rate on sell-side trading, this activity produces incremental profitability, uses excess capacity and grows the liquidity in POSIT.\nRecurring revenue increased primarily from a full period of ITG RFQ-hub activity as compared to only five months in 2014 as well as an increase in billed analytics revenue. Other revenues improved due to a lower impact of trade errors and client accommodations.\nCompensation and benefits increased due to higher salaries from a full period of ITG RFQ-hub, investments in our sales team and higher deferred stock-based compensation associated with awards granted for 2014 and 2013.\nTransaction processing costs increased as a result of an increase in the average daily notional value traded. As a percentage of commissions and fees, transaction processing costs increased to 26.3% from 23.5% in 2014 due to the impact of a higher proportion of value traded by lower-rate, sell-side clients.\nOther expenses increased due to higher charges for global research and development costs, increases in business development and customer connectivity costs and a full period of costs from ITG RFQ-hub.\nAsia Pacific Operations\n\nnm-Not meaningful\nCurrency translation from a weaker Australian Dollar decreased total Asia Pacific revenues by $5.1 million and expenses by $2.6 million, reducing our pre-tax profit by $2.5 million.\nAsia Pacific commissions and fees increased despite unfavorable currency translation and the impact of the SEC Settlement in the second half of 2015 due to strong order flow earlier in the year by U.S. clients and local Asian clients trading into Australia and Hong Kong and the increased use of our trading algorithms and our POSIT Alert block crossing system.\nRecurring revenues decreased primarily from lower revenue earned from global connections due to a change in our attribution method and currency translation. Other revenues improved due to lower client accommodations and errors.\nCompensation and employee benefits decreased due to lower headcount, reduced severance charges and favorable currency translation.\nTransaction processing costs decreased due to a higher proportion of our trading in markets where our costs are lower. As a percentage of commissions and fees, these costs declined to 24.2% from 25.7% in 2014.\nOther expenses increased primarily because of the higher charges for global research and development costs, higher software amortization and consulting expenses.\nCorporate\nCorporate activity includes investment income and other gains as well as costs not associated with operating the businesses within our regional segments. These costs include, among others, (a) the costs of being a public company, such as certain staff costs, a portion of external audit fees, and reporting, filing and listing costs, (b) intangible asset amortization, (c) interest expense, (d) professional fees associated with our global transfer pricing structure, (e) foreign exchange gains or losses and (f) certain non-operating expenses.\nFor 2015, we reported pre-tax income from Corporate activity of $64.7 million, reflecting the $107.7 million gain on the Energy Research Sale, $0.9 million of investment income and $43.9 million of costs. For 2014, we incurred a pre-tax loss from Corporate activity of $20.5 million, reflecting\ninvestment income of $1.3 million and costs of $21.8 million. The $22.1 million increase in costs reflected the $20.3 million cost for the SEC Settlement and related legal and other fees of $4.9 million, offset in part by $2.1 million of reductions in compensation and benefits from the executive changes announced in August 2015 and lower intangible amortization costs due to the full amortization of certain assets.\nConsolidated income tax expense\nOur effective tax rate was 24.5% for 2015 compared to 21.7% for 2014. The low rate in 2015 primarily reflected the impact of a low tax rate on the Energy Research Sale from the availability of a deductible basis that was mostly written-off for book purposes in 2012, significant income generated in Europe where we are taxed at a lower rate and profitability generated in Asia Pacific where we are not incurring a tax cost due to the availability of net operating losses. These impacts were partially offset by a tax expense of $6.5 million on a deemed dividend associated with an amendment to the capital structure of our operations outside North America. The low rate in 2014 reflects the impact of strong earnings from Europe, where we are taxed at a lower rate, and a $2.7 million tax benefit arising from settling multi-year tax return positions offset by establishing additional reserves for other tax positions. Our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.\nResults of Operation-Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nAs noted above, effective in the first quarter of 2015, the Company is presenting its regional segment results excluding the impact of corporate activity. Prior period segment data has been restated to conform to the 2015 presentation.\nU.S. Operations\n\nCommissions and fees decreased due to a 3% reduction in our average daily trading volumes. Although our average revenue per share remained unchanged year over year at $0.0047, the proportion of average daily volumes executed by lower-priced sell-side clients increased to 52% of our volumes compared to 50% in 2013, reducing our revenue per share. While we also saw lower revenue per share from sell-side clients, we continued to see improvement in the revenue per share from buy-side clients.\nThe higher revenue per share from buy-side clients was driven by higher rates for clients' use of our POSIT Alert block crossing system and our high-touch and portfolio trading services.\n\n*Excludes activity from ITG Net commission share arrangements.\nRecurring revenues decreased due to the impact of client attrition from our OMS product, resulting in lower OMS subscription revenues and connectivity fees, partially offset by higher research subscriptions.\nOther revenues increased primarily due to an increase in transaction advisory services revenues generated by our energy research team. This increase more than offset a reduction in revenues generated by our stock loan matched book business, which included a gain of $2.5 million in 2013 related to adjustments to historical dividend withholdings.\nCompensation and employee benefits increased as a result of headcount increases and from higher incentive-based compensation to our management team associated with increased global profitability.\nTransaction processing costs declined more than the decrease in commissions and fees due to lower options volumes, which incur higher costs proportionally than our cash equity trading and lower execution costs from client use of our algorithm technology. As a percentage of commissions and fees, transaction processing costs declined to 17.8% from 18.2% during 2013.\nOther expenses decreased $12.4 million, reflecting lower data center, data and connectivity expenses from our cost reduction initiatives and lower depreciation, software amortization and consulting fees. There was also a higher credit for research and development costs charged to other segments. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in employee recruiting and legal fees.\nCanadian Operations\n\nCurrency translation from a weaker Canadian Dollar decreased total Canadian revenues and expenses by $5.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease of $1.4 million to pre-tax income.\nCanadian commissions and fees increased $2.5 million despite an unfavorable currency translation of $4.0 million, principally due to the growth in MATCH Now volumes of more than 80%.\nRecurring revenues increased due to a higher number of billable network connections through ITG Net and our billing for market data consumed by clients.\nOther revenues increased slightly due to an increase in income earned on foreign exchange transactions and principal arbitrage trading, partially offset by losses on client accommodations and the impact of currency translation.\nCompensation and employee benefits costs decreased primarily due to the impact of currency translation and a decrease in share-based compensation, which fluctuates for legacy awards to Canadian employees based on the changes in the market price of our stock, partially offset by an increase in incentive-based compensation related to increased profitability.\nTransaction processing costs decreased due to lower rates for clearing and settlement from contract renegotiation with our clearing provider, lower execution costs as a higher percentage of our volume was executed in MATCH Now and the impact of currency translation. As a percentage of commission and fees, transaction processing costs declined to 16.2% from 18.6% in 2013.\nThe decrease in other expenses was primarily driven by lower connectivity expenses and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by higher charges for historical market data and legal-related expenses.\nEuropean Operations\n\nCurrency translation from a stronger average British Pound increased European revenues and expenses by $6.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively, adding $1.6 million to pre-tax income.\nEuropean results include substantially all the ITG RFQ-hub operations since the July 30, 2014 acquisition date, adding $2.0 million in revenues, mostly recurring, and $2.2 million in expenses.\nOur European commissions and fees grew 43% in 2014 as compared to 2013, far outpacing the 16% growth in market-wide value traded. The investments we made in our infrastructure and our product suite resulted in increased activity from buy-side and sell-side clients using our electronic\nbrokerage offerings, including our trading algorithms and POSIT, and from clients using our POSIT Alert block crossing system. We also saw increased commissions from the use of our high-touch trading services. Commissions and fees also benefitted from $5.9 million in favorable currency translation.\nRecurring revenues increased primarily from the new connectivity revenue from ITG RFQ-hub.\nCompensation and employee benefits increased due to higher incentive-based compensation related to improved performance, increase in headcount, including employees from the ITG RFQ-hub acquisition, and the impact of the unfavorable currency translation of $1.7 million. This increase was offset, in part, by $3.1 million in lower compensation associated with the outsourcing of our research and development facility in Israel to a third-party service provider.\nTransaction processing costs increased due to the significant increase in value traded. However, transaction processing costs declined as a percentage of commissions and fees to 23.5% from 24.6% in 2013 due to the impact of a higher percentage of our value traded crossed in POSIT, including our POSIT Alert block crossing system, and our initiatives to reduce settlement and clearing costs.\nOther expenses increased due to higher charges for (a) global research and development costs, (b) historical market data, (c) consulting costs, net of capitalization, attributable to the outsourcing of our research and development facility in Israel to a third-party service provider, (d) marketing costs and (e) the additional costs added by ITG RFQ-hub.\nAsia Pacific Operations\n\nnm-Not meaningful\nCurrency translation from a weaker Australian Dollar decreased total Asia Pacific revenues and expenses both by $1.3 million, resulting in no impact on our pre-tax loss.\nAsia Pacific commissions and fees increased despite a reduction in market-wide trading activity and unfavorable currency translation due to the growth in commissions from clients using our POSIT Alert block crossing system and algorithmic trading capabilities as well as from higher commission-sharing revenues.\nThe growth in recurring revenues primarily reflects growth in the number of billable network connections through ITG Net and the decrease in other revenues is due to higher client trade accommodations, which totaled $1.2 million in 2014, compared to $0.3 million in 2013.\nCompensation and employee benefits increased due to increases in headcount and employee termination charges, partially offset by higher capitalized compensation for software development and favorable currency translation.\nTransaction processing costs decreased due to a reduction in value traded and our efforts to reduce execution and settlement costs. As a percentage of commissions and fees, transaction processing costs declined to 25.7% from 28.6% in 2013.\nThe increase in other expenses reflects higher charges for historical market data and global research and development, as well as increases in hardware and software maintenance and connectivity, partially offset by reductions in market data costs.\nCorporate\nFor 2014, we incurred a pre-tax loss from Corporate activity of $20.5 million, reflecting investment income of $1.3 million and costs of $21.8 million. For 2013, we incurred a pre-tax loss from Corporate activity of $25.9 million, reflecting investment income of $1.5 million and costs of $27.4 million. Corporate costs in 2013 included $2.6 million of duplicate rent charges associated with the build out of our new headquarters in lower Manhattan while we still occupied our then-existing headquarters in midtown Manhattan, a $3.9 million charge related to our office move, including a reserve for the remaining lease obligation and a $1.5 million restructuring charge to close our technology research and development facility in Israel. These costs were partially offset by a $1.3 million reversal of previously-recorded 2012 and 2011 restructuring liabilities as a portion of the space vacated in our Los Angeles office was sub-let and certain legal and other employee-related accruals were deemed unnecessary.\nConsolidated income tax expense\nOur effective tax rate was 21.7% for 2014 compared to 27.8% for 2013. The low rate in both periods is the result of a significantly higher proportion of our pre-tax income arising from our European Operations, which is taxed at a lower rate. Additionally, in the U.S. we recorded a $2.7 million tax benefit in 2014 for the net impact of settling multi-year tax return positions and establishing additional reserves for other tax positions. In 2013, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the resolution of a tax contingency in Europe and the recognition of the full-year 2012 research and experimentation credit in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2013 due to the timing of tax legislation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Our liquidity requirements result from our working capital needs, which include clearing and settlement activities, as well as our regulatory capital needs. A substantial portion of our assets is liquid, consisting of cash and cash equivalents or assets readily convertible into cash. Cash is principally invested in U.S. government money market mutual funds and other money market mutual funds. At December 31, 2015, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $330.7 million. Included in this amount is $117.1 million of cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside the United States. Due to the December 2015 amendment to the capital structure of our operations outside of North America, which included a deemed dividend on all cumulative undistributed earnings, we currently do not foresee a need to repatriate funds from certain foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. by way of additional dividends. Should we need to do so in the future, our effective tax rate may increase. As a self-clearing broker-dealer in the U.S., we are subject to cash deposit requirements with clearing organizations that may be large in relation to total liquid assets and may fluctuate significantly based upon the nature and size of customers' trading activity and market volatility. At December 31, 2015, we had interest-bearing\nsecurity deposits totaling $23.3 million with clearing organizations in the U.S. for the settlement of equity trades. In the normal course of our U.S. settlement activities, we may also need to temporarily finance customer securities positions from short settlements or delivery failures. These financings may be funded from existing cash resources, borrowings under stock loan transactions or short-term bank loans under our committed facility. In January 2016, we entered into a new $150 million 364-day revolving credit agreement (the \"New Credit Agreement\") with a syndicate of banks and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The terms and conditions of the New Credit Agreement are similar to the credit agreement that matured in January 2016 (see Note 14, Borrowings, and Note 24, Subsequent Events), except that the unused commitment fee is 0.75%.\nWe self-clear equity trades in Hong Kong and Australia, maintaining restricted cash deposits of $26.0 million primarily to support overdraft facilities and we had deposits with clearing organizations of $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. In Europe, we maintain $1.6 million in restricted cash related to protected client funds and we had deposits with our clearing and settlement agents of $41.9 million at December 31, 2015.\nWe expect our cash balance to decline in the first quarter of 2016 as we make tax payments related to the gain from the Energy Research Sale and certain restructurings we have completed, as well as upon payment of incentive compensation for 2015.\nCapital Resources\nCapital resource requirements relate to capital purchases, as well as business investments, and are generally funded from operations. When required, as in the case of a major acquisition, our strong cash generating ability has historically allowed us to access U.S. capital markets.\nOperating Activities\nThe table below summarizes the effect of the major components of operating cash flow.\n\nThe decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2015 was driven by lower adjusted net income (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures) and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The 2014 increase was driven by strong net income and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nIn the normal course of our clearing and settlement activities worldwide, cash is typically used to fund restricted or segregated cash accounts (under regulations and otherwise), broker and customer fails to deliver/receive, securities borrowed, deposits with clearing organizations and net activity related to receivables/payables from/to customers and brokers. The cash requirements vary from day to day depending on volume transacted and customer trading patterns.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities of $73.3 million includes the net proceeds from the Energy Research Sale, partially offset by investments in software development projects and computer hardware and software.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $58.6 million primarily reflects repurchases of ITG common stock, our dividend program, shares withheld for net settlements of share-based awards and repayments of long-term debt, offset by net proceeds from short-term bank borrowings that are used to support our settlement activities.\nDuring 2015, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $51.0 million, which was funded from our available cash resources. Of these shares, 2.0 million were purchased under our Board of Directors' authorization for a total cost of $42.0 million. An additional 0.4 million shares ($9.0 million) pertained solely to the satisfaction of minimum statutory withholding tax upon the net settlement of equity awards. As of December 31, 2015, the total remaining number of shares currently available for repurchase under ITG's stock repurchase program was 2.8 million. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions and other factors. We may elect to conduct future share repurchases through open market purchases, private transactions or automatic share repurchase programs under SEC Rule 10b5-1.\nIn April 2015, our Board of Directors initiated a dividend program under which we began to pay quarterly dividends, subject to quarterly declarations by the Board of Directors. During 2015, our Board of Directors declared and we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per share in each of the second, third and fourth quarters totaling $7.0 million, in the aggregate.\nRegulatory Capital\nITG Inc., AlterNet and ITG Derivatives are subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. ITG Inc. has elected to use the alternative method permitted by Rule 15c3-1, which requires that ITG Inc. maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of $1.0 million or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions, as defined. AlterNet and ITG Derivatives have elected to use the basic method permitted by Rule 15c3-1, which requires that they each maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of 62/3% of aggregate indebtedness or $100,000 and $1.0 million, respectively. Dividends or withdrawals of capital cannot be made if capital is needed to comply with regulatory requirements.\nNet capital balances and the amounts in excess of required net capital at December 31, 2015 for the U.S. Operations are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, ITG Inc. had $7.3 million of cash in a Special Reserve Bank Account for the benefit of customers under the Customer Protection Rule pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3-3, Computation for Determination of Reserve Requirements and $2.5 million under agreements for proprietary accounts of broker-dealers.\nIn addition, our Canadian, European and Asia Pacific Operations have subsidiaries with regulatory capital requirements. The regulatory net capital balances and amount of regulatory capital in excess of\nthe minimum requirements applicable to each business at December 31, 2015, is summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands):\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Outlook\nHistorically, our working capital, stock repurchase, dividend program and investment activity requirements have been funded from cash from operations and short-term loans, with the exception of strategic acquisitions, which at times have required long-term financing. We believe that our cash flow from operations, existing cash balances and our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating cash and regulatory capital needs, while also complying with the terms of the New Credit Agreement. However, our ability to borrow additional funds may be impacted by financial lending institutions' ability or willingness to lend to us on commercially acceptable terms.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nWe are a member of various U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges and clearing houses that trade and clear, respectively, equities and/or derivative contracts. Associated with our membership, we may be required to pay a proportionate share of financial obligations of another member who may default on its obligations to the exchanges or the clearing house. While the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships vary, in general, our guarantee obligations would arise only if the exchange had previously exhausted its resources. The maximum potential payout under these memberships cannot be estimated. We have not recorded any contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for these agreements and believe that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments amounted to $184.7 million in the aggregate and consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\n\n(a)Pursuant to employment arrangements, in the event of termination of employment without cause on December 31, 2015, we would be obligated to pay separation payments totaling $5.5 million.\nThe above information excludes $15.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits discussed in Note 9, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements, because it is not possible to estimate the time period when, or if, it might be paid to tax authorities.\nAs part of the $150 million, 364-day credit agreement we entered into in January 2016, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.75% on any unborrowed amounts.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented and will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard provides companies with a single five step revenue recognition model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The standard will also require significant additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures describing the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt ASU 2014-09. The original standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, however, in April 2015, the FASB proposed a one-year deferral of this standard, with a new effective date of December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the impact of adoption on its financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In many instances, the application of such principles requires management to make estimates or to apply subjective principles to particular facts and circumstances. A change in the estimates or a variance in the application, or interpretation of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. could yield a materially different accounting result. Below is a summary of our critical accounting estimates where we believe that the estimations, judgments or interpretations that we made, if different, would have yielded the most significant differences in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill Impairment: Testing Methodology and Valuation Considerations\nWe obtained goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of certain of our subsidiaries. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired. We are required to periodically assess whether any of our goodwill is impaired. In order to do this, we apply judgment in determining our reporting units, which represent our business segments. Our annual goodwill impairment assessment involves assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the results of our qualitative analysis suggests that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss using a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment testing process is as follows:\n\u2022 Step one-the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value in order to identify potential impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit, potential impairment is indicated at the reporting unit level and step two of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and measure the potential impairment loss.\n\u2022 Step two-when potential impairment is indicated in step one, we compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit's tangible and (non-goodwill) intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination. Any excess in the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization\nIntangible assets with definite useful lives are subject to amortization and are evaluated for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an intangible asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. If such an event or change occurs, we estimate cash flows directly associated with the use of the intangible asset to test its recoverability and assess its remaining useful life. The projected cash flows require assumptions related to revenue growth, operating margins and other relevant market, economic and regulatory factors. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of a finite-lived intangible asset or asset group are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset, we then compare the carrying amount to its current fair value. We estimate the fair value using market prices for similar assets, if available, or by using a discounted cash flow model. We then recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.\nShare-Based Compensation\nIn accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, share-based payment transactions require the application of a fair value methodology that involves various assumptions. The fair value of options awarded is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the following assumptions: expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common stock price and expected dividend yield. We estimate the expected life of the\noptions using historical data and the volatility of our common stock is estimated based on a combination of the historical volatility and the implied volatility from traded options. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards with a market condition is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation is an iterative technique designed to estimate future payouts by taking into account our current stock price, the volatility of our common stock, risk-free rates, and a risk-neutral valuation methodology.\nAlthough both models meet the requirements of ASC 718, the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of the underlying awards, as it does not consider other factors important to those share-based compensation awards, such as continued employment, periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability.\nContingencies and Uncertainties\nThe use of estimates is important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation, mediation, arbitration, regulatory proceedings and various contingencies and uncertainties. Our accounting for contingencies and uncertainties follows the guidance prescribed under ASC 450, Contingencies, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. We review the status of each significant matter and evaluate its potential financial exposure on a regular basis. If the potential loss from any exposure is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainties in the evaluation process, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time, so actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision. As additional information becomes available, our reassessment of the potential liability may lead to a revision in our estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the company's results of operations for any particular period.\nIncome Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions\nASC 740, Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance may be recorded against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or results of operations.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit for each such position that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits. Such estimates involve interpretations of regulations, rulings, case law, etc. and are inherently complex. Our estimates may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes as resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions typically would not be known for several years after completion of any fiscal year. The impact of our reassessment of uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.", "item_7_tables":

report presents Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) for ITG, a financial technology firm offering institutional trading and brokerage services.\n\nOverview:\nITG operates globally with a focus on improving efficiency and execution quality in institutional trading. Their business is segmented into U.S. Operations, Canadian Operations, European Operations, and Asia Pacific Operations. They provide various products and services including Electronic Brokerage, Research, Sales and Trading, Platforms, and Analytics. ITG's financial results are reported excluding certain corporate activities to better reflect regional performance.\n\nSources of Revenue:\nITG generates revenue primarily through commissions and fees, which fluctuate based on trading volume, contract values, and commission rates. Other sources include income from principal trading, net spread on foreign exchange transactions, interest income, market gains/losses from trading, and non-recurring gains and losses such as divestitures.\n\nExpenses:\nThe largest expense is compensation and employee benefits, followed by transaction processing, occupancy and equipment, telecommunications and data processing, and other general and administrative expenses. Expenses vary based on revenue levels and trading activity.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nThe company uses non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted revenues, expenses, and net income to provide a clearer understanding of ongoing operations. Reconciliations between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided.\n\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $91.6 million, or $2.63 per diluted share, with adjusted net income of $29.8 million, or $0.86 per diluted share. These figures include impacts from the Energy Research Sale, SEC Settlement, and restructuring charges.\n\nSegment Analysis:\n- U.S. Operations: Trading volumes were affected by the SEC Settlement, though recovery efforts are showing improvement.\n- Canadian Operations: Volumes decreased, particularly after the SEC Settlement.\n- European Operations: Despite challenges from the SEC Settlement, trading activity increased, with growth outpacing the overall market.\n- Asia Pacific Operations: Performance declined in the latter half of the year, but overall profitability increased compared to 2014.\n\nRegulatory Capital:\nITG maintains regulatory capital in excess of minimum requirements for its various operations. The excess capital provides a buffer for potential financial obligations.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\nITG's primary source of liquidity is cash from operations. Cash flow from operations, along with credit facilities, is expected to cover operating and regulatory capital needs, stock repurchases, dividends, and investment activity. ITG's memberships in various exchanges may require the cover of obligations from other members who default.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates:\nITG's critical accounting estimates involve goodwill impairment testing, valuation of intangible assets, assumptions for share-based compensation, contingencies and uncertainties, and income taxes. Any changes in these estimates could materially impact financial results.\n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements:\nThe company is evaluating several new accounting standards that may impact its financial statements, such as those related to revenue recognition and debt issuance costs.\n\nOverall, ITG's operations demonstrate regional variation, impacted by external events such as SEC settlements, but show signs of recovery and positive trends in select segments. The company maintains a strong focus on maintaining liquidity and capital to support ongoing operations."}
