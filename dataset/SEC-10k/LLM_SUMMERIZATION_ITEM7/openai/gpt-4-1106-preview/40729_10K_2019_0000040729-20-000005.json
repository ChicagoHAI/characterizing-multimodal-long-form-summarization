Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCautionary Notice about Forward-Looking Statements and Other Terms\nFrom time to time we have made, and in the future will make, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, Ally, the Company, or we, us, or our) is a leading digital financial-services company. As a customer-centric company with passionate customer service and innovative financial solutions, we are relentlessly focused on Doing It Right\u201d and being a trusted financial-services provider to our consumer, commercial, and corporate customers. We are one of the largest full-service automotive finance operations in the country and offer a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and consumers. Our award-winning online bank (Ally Bank, Member FDIC and Equal Housing Lender) offers mortgage lending, personal lending, and a variety of deposit and other banking products, including savings, money-market, and checking accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Additionally, we offer\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nsecurities-brokerage and investment-advisory services through Ally Invest. Our robust corporate-finance business offers capital for equity sponsors and middle-market companies. We are a Delaware corporation and are registered as a bank holding company (BHC) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and a financial holding company (FHC) under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended.\nOur Business\nDealer Financial Services\nDealer Financial Services comprises our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments. Our primary customers are automotive dealers, which are independently owned businesses. A dealer may sell or lease a vehicle for cash but, more typically, enters into a retail installment sales contract or operating lease with the customer and then sells the retail installment sales contract or the operating lease and the leased vehicle, as applicable, to Ally or another automotive-finance provider. The purchase by Ally or another provider is commonly described as indirect automotive lending to the customer.\nOur Dealer Financial Services business is one of the largest full-service automotive finance operations in the country and offers a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and their customers. We have deep dealer relationships that have been built throughout our over 100-year history, and we are leveraging competitive strengths to expand our dealer footprint. Our dealer-centric business model encourages dealers to use our broad range of products through incentive programs like our Ally Dealer Rewards program, which rewards individual dealers based on the depth and breadth of our relationship. Our automotive finance services include purchasing retail installment sales contracts and operating leases from dealers, extending automotive loans directly to consumers, offering term loans to dealers, financing dealer floorplans and providing other lines of credit to dealers, supplying warehouse lines to automotive retailers, offering automotive-fleet financing, providing financing to companies and municipalities for the purchase or lease of vehicles, and supplying vehicle-remarketing services. We also offer retail VSCs and commercial insurance primarily covering dealers' vehicle inventories. We are a leading provider of VSCs, GAP, and vehicle maintenance contracts (VMCs).\nAutomotive Finance\nOur Automotive Finance operations provide U.S.-based automotive financing services to consumers, automotive dealers, other businesses, and municipalities. Our dealer-focused business model, value-added products and services, full-spectrum financing, and business expertise proven over many credit cycles make us a premier automotive finance company. At December 31, 2019, our Automotive Finance operations had $113.9 billion of assets and generated $4.4 billion of total net revenue in 2019. For consumers, we provide financing for new and used vehicles. In addition, our Commercial Services Group (CSG) provides automotive financing for small businesses. At December 31, 2019, our CSG had $8.2 billion of loans outstanding. Through our commercial automotive financing operations, we fund dealer purchases of new and used vehicles through wholesale floorplan financing. We manage commercial account servicing on approximately 3,300 dealers that utilize our floorplan inventory lending or other commercial loans. We service an $80.6 billion consumer loan and operating lease portfolio at December 31, 2019, and our commercial automotive loan portfolio was approximately $32.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The extensive infrastructure, technology, and analytics of our servicing operations as well as the experience of our servicing personnel enhance our ability to minimize our loan losses and enable us to deliver a favorable customer experience to both our dealers and retail customers. During 2019, we continued to reposition our origination profile to focus on capital optimization and risk-adjusted returns. In 2019, total consumer automotive originations were $36.3 billion, an increase of $898 million compared to 2018. The shorter-term duration consumer automotive loan and variable-rate commercial loan portfolios offer attractive asset classes where we continue to optimize risk-adjusted returns through origination mix management and pricing and underwriting discipline.\nOur success as an automotive finance provider is driven by the consistent and broad range of products and services we offer to dealers. The automotive marketplace is dynamic and evolving, and we are focused on meeting the needs of both our dealer and consumer customers and continuing to strengthen and expand upon the 18,300 dealer relationships we have. Clearlane, our online automotive lender exchange, expands our direct-to-consumer capabilities and provides a digital platform for consumers seeking financing. Clearlane further enhances our automotive financing offerings, dealer relationships, and digital capabilities. In addition to providing a digital direct-to-consumer channel for Ally, Clearlane is a fee-based business that generates revenue by successfully referring leads to other automotive lenders. Additionally, we continue to identify and cultivate relationships with automotive retailers including those with leading eCommerce platforms. We believe these actions will enable us to respond to the growing trends for a more streamlined and digital automotive financing process to serve both dealers and consumers.\nThe Growth channel was established to focus on developing dealer relationships beyond those relationships that primarily were developed through our role as a captive finance company for General Motors Company (GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC (Chrysler). The Growth channel was expanded to include direct-to-consumer financing through Clearlane and other channels and our arrangements with online automotive retailers. We have established relationships with thousands of Growth channel dealers through our customer-centric approach and specialized incentive programs designed to drive loyalty amongst dealers to our products and services. The success of the Growth channel has been a key enabler to converting our business model from a focused captive finance company to a leading market competitor. In this channel, we currently have over 11,800 dealer relationships, of which approximately 88% are franchised dealers (including brands such as Ford, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda, and others), or used vehicle only retailers with a national presence.\nOver the past several years, we have continued to focus on the consumer used vehicle segment primarily through franchised dealers, which has resulted in used vehicle financing volume growth, and has positioned us as an industry leader in used vehicle financing. The highly fragmented used vehicle financing market, with a total financing opportunity represented by over 279 million vehicles in operation, provides\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nan attractive opportunity that we believe will further expand and support our dealer relationships and increase our risk-adjusted return on retail loan originations.\nFor consumers, we provide automotive loan financing and leasing for new and used vehicles to approximately 4.5 million customers. Retail financing for the purchase of vehicles by individual consumers generally takes the form of installment sales financing. We originated a total of approximately 1.4 million automotive loans and operating leases during both the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, totaling $36.3 billion and $35.4 billion, respectively.\nOur consumer automotive financing operations generate revenue primarily through finance charges on retail installment sales contracts and rental payments on operating lease contracts. For operating leases, when the contract is originated, we estimate the residual value of the leased vehicle at lease termination. Periodically thereafter we revise the projected residual value of the leased vehicle at lease termination and adjust depreciation expense over the remaining life of the lease if appropriate. Given the fluctuations in used vehicle values, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the projected residual value, which results in gains or losses on lease termination. While all operating leases are exposed to potential reductions in used vehicle values, only loans where we take possession of the vehicle are affected by potential reductions in used vehicle values. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion of credit risk and lease residual risk.\nWe continue to maintain a diverse mix of product offerings across a broad risk spectrum, subject to underwriting policies that reflect our risk appetite. Our current operating results continue to increasingly reflect our ongoing strategy to grow used vehicle financing and expand risk-adjusted returns. While we predominately focus on prime-lending markets, we seek to be a meaningful source of financing to a wide spectrum of customers and continue to carefully measure risk versus return. We place great emphasis on our risk management and risk-based pricing policies and practices and employ robust credit decisioning processes coupled with granular pricing that is differentiated across our proprietary credit tiers.\nOur commercial automotive financing operations primarily fund dealer inventory purchases of new and used vehicles, commonly referred to as wholesale floorplan financing. This represents the largest portion of our commercial automotive financing business. Wholesale floorplan loans are secured by vehicles financed (and all other vehicle inventory), which provide strong collateral protection in the event of dealership default. Additional collateral or other credit enhancements (for example, personal guarantees from dealership owners) are typically obtained to further mitigate credit risk. The amount we advance to dealers is equal to 100% of the wholesale invoice price of new vehicles. Interest on wholesale automotive financing is generally payable monthly and is indexed to a floating-rate benchmark. The rate for a particular dealer is based on, among other considerations, competitive factors and the dealer's creditworthiness. During 2019, we financed an average of $28.2 billion of dealer vehicle inventory through wholesale floorplan financings. Other commercial automotive lending products, which averaged $5.7 billion during 2019, consist of automotive dealer revolving lines of credit, term loans, including those to finance dealership land and buildings, and dealer fleet financing. We also provide comprehensive automotive remarketing services, including the use of SmartAuction, our online auction platform, which efficiently supports dealer-to-dealer and other commercial wholesale vehicle transactions. SmartAuction provides diversified fee-based revenue and serves as a means of deepening relationships with our dealership customers. In 2019, Ally and other parties, including dealers, fleet rental companies, and financial institutions, utilized SmartAuction to sell approximately 270,000 vehicles to dealers and other commercial customers. SmartAuction served as the remarketing channel for 53% of our off-lease vehicles.\nInsurance\nOur Insurance operations offer both consumer finance protection and insurance products sold primarily through the automotive dealer channel, and commercial insurance products sold directly to dealers. We serve approximately 2.4 million consumers nationwide across Finance and Insurance (F&I) and Property and Casualty (P&C) products. In addition, we offer F&I products in Canada, where we serve approximately 445 thousand consumers and are the VSC and protection plan provider for GM Canada. Our Insurance operations had $8.5 billion of assets at December 31, 2019, and generated $1.3 billion of total net revenue during 2019. As part of our focus on offering dealers a broad range of consumer financial and insurance products, we offer VSCs, VMCs, and GAP products. We also underwrite selected commercial insurance coverages, which primarily insure dealers' wholesale vehicle inventory. Ally Premier Protection is our flagship VSC offering, which provides coverage for new and used vehicles of virtually all makes and models. We also offer ClearGuard on the SmartAuction platform, which is a protection product designed to minimize the risk to dealers from arbitration claims for eligible vehicles sold at auction.\nFrom a dealer perspective, Ally provides significant value and expertise, which creates high retention rates and strong relationships. In addition to our product offerings, we provide consultative services and training to assist dealers in optimizing F&I results while achieving high levels of customer satisfaction and regulatory compliance. We also advise dealers regarding necessary liability and physical damage coverages.\nOur F&I products are primarily distributed indirectly through the automotive dealer network. We have established approximately 1,800 F&I dealer relationships nationwide and 600 dealer relationships in Canada, with a focus on growing dealer relationships in the future. Our VSCs for retail customers offer owners and lessees mechanical repair protection and roadside assistance for new and used vehicles beyond the manufacturer's new vehicle warranty. These VSCs are marketed to the public through automotive dealerships and on a direct response basis. We also offer GAP products, which allow the recovery of a specified amount beyond the covered vehicle's value in the event the vehicle is damaged or stolen and declared a total loss. We continue to evolve our product suite and digital capabilities to position our business for future opportunities through growing third-party relationships and sales through our online automotive lending exchange, Clearlane.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nWe have approximately 3,400 dealer relationships within our P&C business to whom we offer a variety of commercial products and levels of coverage. Vehicle inventory insurance for dealers provides physical damage protection for dealers' floorplan vehicles. Among dealers to whom we provide wholesale financing, our insurance product penetration rate is approximately 77%. Dealers who receive wholesale financing from us are eligible for insurance incentives such as automatic eligibility for our preferred insurance programs. In April 2019, we renewed our annual reinsurance agreement to obtain excess of loss coverage for our vehicle inventory insurance product to manage our risk of weather-related loss.\nA significant aspect of our Insurance operations is the investment of proceeds from premiums and other revenue sources. We use these investments to satisfy our obligations related to future claims at the time these claims are settled. Our Insurance operations have an Investment Committee, which develops guidelines and strategies for these investments. The guidelines established by this committee reflect our risk appetite, liquidity requirements, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors.\nMortgage Finance\nOur Mortgage Finance operations consist of the management of held-for-investment and held-for-sale consumer mortgage loan portfolios. Our held-for-investment portfolio includes bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and low-to-moderate income (LMI) mortgage loans originated by third parties, and our direct-to-consumer Ally Home mortgage offering. Our Mortgage Finance operations had $16.3 billion of assets at December 31, 2019, and generated $193 million of total net revenue in 2019.\nThrough the bulk loan channel, we purchase loans from several qualified sellers including direct originators and large aggregators who have the financial capacity to support strong representations and warranties and the industry knowledge and experience to originate high-quality assets. Bulk purchases are made on a servicing-released basis, allowing us to directly oversee servicing activities and manage prepayments through retention modification or refinancing through our direct-to-consumer channel. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased $3.5 billion of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties. Our mortgage loan purchases are held-for-investment.\nThrough our direct-to-consumer channel, which was introduced late in 2016, we offer a variety of competitively priced jumbo and conforming fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage products through a third-party fulfillment provider. Under our current arrangement, our direct-to-consumer conforming mortgages are originated as held-for-sale and sold, while jumbo and LMI mortgages are originated as held-for-investment. Loans originated in the direct-to-consumer channel are sourced by existing Ally customer marketing, prospect marketing on third-party websites, and email or direct mail campaigns. In April of 2019, we announced a strategic partnership with Better.com, which delivers an enhanced end-to-end digital mortgage experience for our customers through our direct-to-consumer channel. Through this partnership, Better.com conducts the sales, processing, underwriting, and closing for Ally's digital mortgage offerings in a highly innovative, scalable, and cost-efficient manner, while Ally retains control of all the marketing and advertising strategies and loan pricing. Ally and Better.com launched in 39 states since partnership inception. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we originated $2.7 billion of mortgage loans through our direct-to-consumer channel.\nThe combination of our bulk portfolio purchase program and our direct-to-consumer strategy provides the capacity to expand revenue sources and further grow and diversify our finance receivable portfolio with an attractive asset class while also deepening relationships with existing Ally customers.\nCorporate Finance\nOur Corporate Finance operations primarily provides senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle-market companies owned by private equity sponsors, and loans to asset managers that primarily provide leveraged loans. Our Corporate Finance operations had $5.8 billion of assets at December 31, 2019, and generated $284 million of total net revenue during 2019, and continues to offer attractive returns and diversification benefits to our broader lending portfolio. We believe our growing deposit-based funding model coupled with our expanded product offerings and deep industry relationships provide an advantage over our competition, which includes other banks as well as publicly and privately held finance companies. While there has been an increase in liquidity and competition in the middle-market lending space given a strong economic environment and favorable returns in this area, we have continued to prudently grow our lending portfolio with a focus on a disciplined and selective approach to credit quality, including a greater focus on asset-based loans. We seek markets and opportunities where our clients require customized, complex, and time-sensitive financing solutions. Our corporate finance lending portfolio is generally composed of first-lien, first-out loans.\nOur primary focus is on businesses owned by private equity sponsors with loans typically used for leveraged buyouts, mergers and acquisitions, debt refinancing, expansions, restructurings, and working capital. Additionally, our Lender Finance business provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct-lending activities. Our target commitment hold level for individual exposures ranges from $25 million to $150 million for individual borrowers, depending on product type. We also selectively arrange larger transactions that we may retain on-balance sheet or syndicate to other lenders. By syndicating loans to other lenders, we are able to provide financing commitments in excess of our target hold levels to our customers and generate loan syndication fee income while limiting our risk exposure to individual borrowers. Loan facilities typically include both a revolver and term loan component. All of our loans are floating-rate facilities with maturities, typically ranging from two to seven years. In certain instances, we may be offered the opportunity to make small equity investments in our borrowers, where we could benefit from potential appreciation in the company's value. The portfolio is well diversified across multiple industries including manufacturing, distribution, services, and other specialty sectors. These specialty sectors include our Technology Finance and Healthcare verticals. Our Technology Finance vertical provides financing solutions to venture capital-backed, technology-based companies. The Healthcare vertical provides financing across the healthcare spectrum including services, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and medical devices and supplies. We also provide a commercial real estate product focused on lending to skilled nursing\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nfacilities, senior housing, medical office buildings, and hospitals. Other smaller complementary product offerings that help strengthen our reputation as a full-spectrum provider of financing solutions for borrowers include selectively offering second-out loans on certain transactions and issuing letters of credit through Ally Bank.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other primarily consists of centralized corporate treasury activities such as management of the cash and corporate investment securities and loan portfolios, short- and long-term debt, retail and brokered deposit liabilities, derivative instruments, original issue discount, and the residual impacts of our corporate funds-transfer pricing (FTP) and treasury asset liability management (ALM) activities. Corporate and Other also includes activity related to certain equity investments, which primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and FRB stock, the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio, which primarily consists of loans originated prior to January 1, 2009, and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments.\nCorporate and Other also includes the results of Ally Invest, our digital brokerage and wealth management offering, which enables us to complement our competitive deposit products with low-cost investing. The digital wealth management business aligns with our strategy to create a premier digital financial services company and provides additional sources of fee income through asset management and certain other fees, with minimal balance sheet utilization. This business also provides an additional source of low-cost brokered deposits through arrangements with Ally Invest's clearing broker.\nThrough Ally Invest, we are able to offer a broader array of products through a fully integrated digital consumer platform centered around self-directed products and digital advisory services. Ally Invest's suite of commission-free and low-cost investing options serve both active and passive investors with diverse and evolving financial objectives through a transparent online process. Our digital platform and broad product offerings are enhanced by outstanding client-focused and user-friendly customer service that is accessible twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, via the phone, web or email-consistent with the Ally brand.\nAlly Invest provides clients with self-directed trading services for a variety of securities including stocks, options, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and fixed-income products through Ally Invest Securities. Ally Invest Securities also offers margin lending, which allows customers to borrow money by using securities and cash currently held in their accounts as collateral. Through Ally Invest Forex, we offer self-directed investors and traders the ability to trade over 50 currency pairs through a state-of-the-art forex trading platform.\nAlly Invest also provides digital advisory services to clients through web-based solutions, informational resources, and virtual interaction through Ally Invest Advisors, an SEC-registered investment advisor. These services have emerged as a fast-growing segment within the financial services industry over the past several years. Ally Invest Advisors provides clients the opportunity to obtain professional portfolio management services in return for a fee based upon the client's assets under management. We also offer cash enhanced portfolios that incur no management fee. A number of core managed portfolios are offered, which hold ETFs diversified across asset class, industry sector, and geography and which are customized for clients based on risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and wealth ratio.\nAdditionally, beginning in October 2019 with the acquisition of Health Credit Services, financial information related to our point-of-sale consumer unsecured financing is included within Corporate and Other. The Health Credit Services business has been renamed Ally Lending and currently serves medical service providers by enabling promotional and fixed rate installment-loan products through a fully digital application process that offers direct integration with health care provider systems. This platform includes providing underwriting, financing application and loan processing, servicing and collections. While we currently focus on healthcare-related lending, we believe the market outlook for point-of-sale lending provides attractive opportunities for future diversification. Point-of-sale lending broadens our capabilities, expands our product offering into consumer unsecured lending, all while helping to further meet financial needs of our customers. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the acquisition of Health Credit Services.\nThe net financing revenue and other interest income of our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance operations include the results of an FTP process that insulates these operations from interest rate volatility by matching assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. The FTP process assigns charge rates to the assets and credit rates to the liabilities within our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance operations, based on anticipated maturity and a benchmark rate curve plus an assumed credit spread. The assumed credit spread represents the cost of funds for each asset class based on a blend of funding channels available to the enterprise, including unsecured and secured capital markets, private funding facilities, and deposits. In addition, a risk-based methodology is used to allocate equity to these operations.\nDeposits\nWe are focused on growing a stable deposit base and deepening relationships with our nearly 2.0 million primary deposit customers by leveraging our compelling brand and strong value proposition. Ally Bank is a direct bank with no branch network that obtains retail deposits directly from customers through internet, telephone, mobile, and mail channels. We have grown our deposits with a strong brand that is based on a promise of being straightforward with our customers and offering high-quality customer service. Ally Bank has consistently increased its share of the direct banking deposit market and remains one of the largest direct banks in terms of retail deposit balances. Our strong retention rates and a growing customer base reflect the strength of our brand and, together with competitive deposit rates, continue to drive growth in retail deposits. At December 31, 2019, Ally Bank had $120.8 billion of total deposits-including $103.7 billion of retail deposits, which grew $14.6 billion, or 16% during 2019. Over the past several years, the continued growth of our retail-deposit base has contributed to a more favorable mix of lower cost funding and we continue to focus on efficient deposit growth by continuing to expand the deposit value proposition beyond competitive deposit rates. Our segment results include cost of funds associated with these deposit-product offerings.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOur deposit products and services are designed to develop long-term customer relationships and capitalize on the shift in consumer preference for direct banking. These products and services appeal to a broad group of customers, many of whom appreciate a streamlined digital experience coupled with our strong value proposition. Ally Bank offers a full spectrum of deposit product offerings, such as savings and money-market accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, CDs, including several raise-your-rate CD terms, IRAs, and trust accounts. Our deposit services include Zelle\u00ae person-to-person payment services, eCheck remote deposit capture, and mobile banking. In addition, brokered deposits are obtained through third-party intermediaries.\nWe believe we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from the consumer-driven shift from branch banking to direct banking as demonstrated by the growth we have experienced. Our nearly 2.0 million deposit customers and 4.0 million retail bank accounts as of December 31, 2019, reflect increases from 1.6 million and 3.2 million, respectively, as compared to December 31, 2018. Our customer base spans across diverse demographic segmentations and socioeconomic bands. Our direct bank business model resonates particularly well with the millennial generation, which consistently makes up the largest percentage of our new customers. According to a 2019 American Bankers Association survey, 83% of customers prefer to do their banking most often via digital and other direct channels (internet, mobile, telephone, and mail). Furthermore, over the past five years, estimated direct banking deposits as a percentage of the broader retail deposits market increased by approximately 3 percentage points, from 7% to 10%. We have received a positive response to innovative savings and other deposit products and have been recognized as a best online bank\u201d by industry and consumer publications. Ally Bank's competitive direct banking includes online and mobile banking features such as electronic bill pay, remote deposit, and electronic funds transfer nationwide, with innovative interfaces such as banking through Alexa-enabled devices, and no minimum balance requirements.\nWe intend to continue to grow and invest in our direct online bank and further capitalize on the shift in consumer preference for direct banking with expanded digital capabilities and customer-centric products that utilize advanced analytics for personalized interactions and other technologies that improve efficiency, security, and the customer's connection to the brand. We are focused on growing, deepening, and further leveraging the customer relationships and brand loyalty that exist with Ally Bank as a catalyst for future loan and deposit growth, as well as revenue opportunities that arise from introducing Ally Bank deposit customers to our digital wealth management offering, Ally Invest.\nFunding and Liquidity\nOur funding strategy targets a stable retail deposit base, supplemented by brokered deposits, public and private secured debt, and public unsecured debt. These diversified funding sources are managed across products, markets, and investors to enhance funding flexibility and stability, resulting in a more cost-effective long-term funding strategy.\nPrudent expansion of asset originations at Ally Bank and continued growth of a stable deposit base continue to be the cornerstone of our long-term liquidity strategy. Retail deposits provide a low-cost source of funds that are less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility, or changes in our credit ratings than other funding sources. At December 31, 2019, deposit liabilities totaled $120.8 billion, which reflects an increase of $14.6 billion as compared to December 31, 2018. Deposits as a percentage of total liability-based funding increased nine percentage points to 75% at December 31, 2019, as compared to December 31, 2018.\nIn addition to building a larger deposit base, we continue to remain active in the securitization markets to finance our automotive loan portfolios. During 2019, we issued $3.6 billion in securitizations backed by consumer automotive loans. Securitizations continue to be a reliable and cost-effective source of funding due to structural efficiencies and the established market. Additionally, for retail loans and operating leases, the term structure of the transaction locks in funding for a specified pool of loans and operating leases. Once a pool of consumer automotive loans is selected and placed into a securitization, the underlying assets and corresponding debt amortize simultaneously resulting in committed and matched funding for the life of the asset. We manage the execution risk arising from securitizations by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and committed secured credit facilities.\nAs we continue to migrate assets to Ally Bank and grow our bank funding capabilities, our need for funding at the parent company has been reduced. At December 31, 2019, 93% of Ally's total assets were within Ally Bank. This compares to approximately 89% as of December 31, 2018. Longer-term unsecured debt is the primary funding source utilized at the parent company. At December 31, 2019, we had $2.3 billion and $702 million of unsecured long-term debt principal maturing in 2020 and 2021, respectively. We plan to reduce our reliance on market-based funding by continuing to focus on stable, lower cost retail deposit funding.\nThe strategies outlined above have allowed us to build and maintain a conservative liquidity position. Total available liquidity at December 31, 2019, was $29.9 billion. Absolute levels of liquidity increased during 2019 primarily as a result of continued growth in our portfolio of highly liquid investment securities. Refer to the section below titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital for a further discussion about liquidity risk management.\nCredit Strategy\nOur strategy and approach to extending credit, as well as our management of credit risk, are critical elements of our business. Credit performance is influenced by a number of factors including our risk appetite, our credit and underwriting processes, our monitoring and collection efforts, the financial condition of our borrowers, the performance of loan collateral, and various macroeconomic considerations. The majority of our businesses offer credit products and services, which drive overall business performance. Consistent with our risk appetite, our business lines operate under credit standards that consider the borrower's ability and willingness to repay loans. The failure to effectively manage credit risk can have a direct and significant impact on Ally's earnings, capital position, and reputation. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for a further discussion of credit risk and performance of our consumer and commercial credit portfolios.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nWithin our Automotive Finance operations, we target a mix of consumers across the credit spectrum to achieve portfolio diversification and to optimize the risk and return of our consumer automotive portfolio. This is achieved through the utilization of robust credit decisioning processes coupled with granular pricing that is differentiated across our proprietary credit tiers. While we are a full-spectrum automotive finance lender, the significant majority of our consumer automotive loans are underwritten within the prime-lending segment. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses, as of December 31, 2019, was approximately 11.6%. During 2019, our strategy for originations was to optimize the deployment of capital by focusing on risk-adjusted returns against available origination opportunities, which has included a gradual and measured shift toward our Growth channel including used vehicle financings.\nThe Mortgage Finance team focuses on applicants with stronger credit profiles and with income streams to support repayments of the loan and operates under credit standards that consider and assess the value of the underlying real estate in accordance with prudent credit practices and regulatory requirements. Refer to the Mortgage Finance section of the MD&A that follows for credit quality information about purchases and originations of consumer mortgages held-for-investment. We generally rely on appraisals conducted by licensed appraisers in conformance with the expectations and requirements of Fannie Mae and federal regulators. When appropriate, we require credit enhancements such as private mortgage insurance. We price each mortgage loan that we originate based on a number of factors, including the customer's FICO\u00ae Score, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and the size of the loan. For bulk purchases, we only purchase loans from sellers with the financial wherewithal to support their representations and warranties and the experience to originate high-quality loans.\nAs further described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 1, 2019, we acquired Health Credit Services, a digital payment provider that operates under the name Ally Lending, and offers point-of-sale financing to consumers. This expansion into digital point-of-sale lending further broadens Ally's product portfolio to unsecured consumer financing. As of December 31, 2019, our gross carrying value of finance receivables related to Ally Lending was $212 million.\nWithin our commercial lending portfolios, Corporate Finance operations primarily provide senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle-market companies. During 2019, we continued to prudently grow this portfolio with a disciplined and selective approach to credit quality, which has generally included the avoidance of covenant-light lending arrangements. This includes growth of our lender finance vertical launched in 2019, which provides senior secured revolving credit facilities to asset managers, collateralized by a portfolio of loans. Within our commercial automotive business, we continue to offer a variety of dealer-centric lending products that primarily relate to floorplan financing and term loans. These commercial products are an important aspect of our dealer relationships and offer a secured lending arrangement with a number of strong collateral protections in the event of dealer default. The performance of our commercial credit portfolios continues to remain strong, as nonperforming finance receivables and loans decreased $134 million from December 31, 2018, to $215 million at December 31, 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, we recognized total net charge-offs of $49 million and $8 million, respectively, within our commercial lending portfolios, primarily driven by partial charge-offs of four exposures within our Corporate Finance portfolio, as well as three accounts within our commercial automotive portfolio. Despite the increase in net charge-offs, our total commercial net charge-off ratio represented 0.1% of average commercial receivables and loans for the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further details.\nDuring 2019, the U.S. economy continued to modestly expand, led by consumer spending. The labor market remained robust during the year, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.5% as of December 31, 2019. Our credit portfolios will continue to be impacted by household, business, economic, and market conditions-including used vehicle and housing price levels, and unemployment levels-and their impact to our borrowers. We expect to experience modest downward pressure on used vehicle values during 2020.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuring 2013 and 2012, certain disposal groups met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. The remaining activity relates to previous discontinued operations for which we continue to have wind-down, legal, and minimal operational costs. For all periods presented, the operating results for these operations have been removed from continuing operations. The MD&A has been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nPrimary Business Lines\nDealer Financial Services, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance are our primary business lines.

billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, results were favorably impacted by higher net financing revenue, primarily driven by higher yields and growth in earning assets. Results for the year ended December 31, 2019, were also favorably impacted by a release of valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards during the second quarter of 2019, and higher market values of equity investments primarily within our Insurance operations. These items were partially offset by higher provision for loan losses, and higher noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet financing revenue and other interest income increased $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Within our Automotive Finance operations, consumer automotive financing revenue benefited from improved portfolio yields as a result of our continued focus on expanding risk-adjusted returns, and higher average consumer asset levels resulting from sustained asset growth. During the year ended December 31, 2019, commercial automotive net financing revenue also increased due primarily to higher yields resulting from higher average benchmark interest rates. Income from interest and dividends on investment securities and other earning assets, including cash and cash equivalents, increased $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, due to both higher yields and higher balances of investment securities as we continue to utilize this portfolio to manage liquidity and generate a stable source of income. Financing revenue and other interest income within our Corporate Finance operations was favorably impacted by our strategy to prudently grow assets and our product suite within existing verticals while selectively pursuing opportunities to broaden industry and product diversification. The increase to financing revenue and other interest income was partially offset by an increase of 17% in total interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWhile we continue to shift borrowings toward more cost-effective deposit funding and reduce our dependence on market-based funding through reductions in higher-cost secured and unsecured debt, interest expense increased as a result of higher market rates across all funding\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nsources. Additionally, our overall borrowing levels were higher to support the growth in our lending operations. Our total deposit liabilities increased $14.6 billion to $120.8 billion as of December 31, 2019, as compared to December 31, 2018.\nInsurance premiums and service revenue earned was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $1.0 billion for 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to vehicle inventory insurance portfolio growth and rate increases.\nOther gain on investments, net increased $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due to favorable market conditions during the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain on investments for the year ended December 31, 2019, includes $92 million of unrealized gains as a result of changes in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities, compared to $121 million of unrealized losses in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe provision for loan losses was $998 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $918 million in 2018. The increase in provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by reserve reductions during the year ended December 31, 2018, associated with hurricane activity experienced during 2017 within our consumer automotive loan portfolio, the acquisition of the Health Credit Services portfolio, and increases within the corporate finance portfolio due to favorable credit ratings migration in 2018 and portfolio growth, as well as a $6 million recovery of a previously charged-off loan in the second quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting and higher recoveries. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion on our provision for loan losses.\nNoninterest expense increased $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was driven by increased expenses to support the growth of our consumer product suite. We continue to make investments in our technology platform to enhance the customer experience and expand our digital capabilities, and in marketing activities to promote brand awareness and drive retail deposit growth. Additionally, the increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was driven by higher insurance losses and loss adjustment expense within our insurance operations primarily related to growth experienced in our portfolio of products.\nWe recognized total income tax expense from continuing operations of $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $359 million in 2018. The decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to a release of valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards during the second quarter of 2019. The valuation allowance release was primarily driven by our current capacity to engage in certain foreign securitization transactions and the market demand from investors related to these transactions, coupled with the anticipated timing of the forecasted expiration of certain foreign tax credit carryforwards. Additionally, the decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was partially offset by the tax effects of an increase in pretax earnings and a nonrecurring tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance against state net operating loss carryforwards as a result of a state tax law enactment in the third quarter of 2018.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nDealer Financial Services\nResults for Dealer Financial Services are presented by reportable segment, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations.\nAutomotive Finance\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of our Automotive Finance operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we continued to focus on driving capital optimization and expanding risk-adjusted returns. As a result, we experienced higher consumer loan financing revenue, primarily due to an increase in consumer loan portfolio yields and asset levels. We also experienced higher commercial financing revenue due to higher yields resulting from higher average benchmark interest rates. Growth in finance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, was partially offset by higher interest expense driven by higher funding costs and growth in our consumer loan portfolio as well as an increase in provision for loan losses.\nConsumer automotive loan financing revenue increased $488 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to improved portfolio yields as a result of our continued focus on expanding risk-adjusted returns, and higher average consumer asset levels resulting from sustained asset growth, including a continued focus on the used-vehicle portfolio primarily through franchised dealers and growth in application volume from our dealer network. Through these actions, we continue to optimize our origination mix and achieve greater portfolio diversification.\nCommercial loan financing revenue increased $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher yields resulting from higher average benchmark interest rates. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in average outstanding floorplan assets compared to 2018.\nInterest expense was $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $2.5 billion for the year in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher funding costs and growth in our consumer automotive loan portfolio.\nWe recorded gains from the sale of consumer automotive loans of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to gains of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We continue to selectively utilize whole-loan sales to proactively manage our credit exposure, asset levels, funding, and capital utilization, including the sale of previously written-down consumer automotive loans related to consumers in Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nOther income decreased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in servicing fee income resulting from lower levels of off-balance-sheet consumer automotive serviced loans and also attributable to a decrease in remarketing fee income resulting from lower operating lease termination volume.\nTotal net operating lease revenue increased $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to favorable performance and mix in our outstanding lease portfolio. Additionally, we recognized lower remarketing gains of $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $90 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a lower number of terminated units and lower gain per unit. The lower number of terminated units was primarily due to the runoff of our legacy GM operating lease portfolio, which was substantially wound-down as of June 30, 2018. Refer to the Operating Lease Residual Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe provision for loan losses was $962 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $920 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in provision for loan losses was primarily driven by reserve reductions during the year ended December 31, 2018, associated with hurricane activity experienced during 2017 in our consumer automotive loan portfolio. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting, and higher recoveries. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAutomotive Financing Volume\nOur Automotive Finance operations provide automotive financing services to consumers and automotive dealers. For consumers, we provide retail financing and leasing for new and used vehicles, and through our commercial automotive financing operations, we fund dealer purchases of new and used vehicles through wholesale floorplan financing and provide dealer term and revolving loans and automotive fleet financing.\nAcquisition and Underwriting\nOur consumer underwriting process is focused on multidimensional risk factors and data driven risk-adjusted probabilities that are continuously monitored and routinely updated. Each application is placed into an analytical category based on specific aspects of the applicant's credit profile and loan structure. We then evaluate the application by applying a proprietary credit scoring algorithm tailored to its applicable category. Inputs into this algorithm include, but are not limited to, proprietary scores and deal structure variables such as LTV, new or used vehicle collateral, and term of financing. The output of the algorithm is used to sort applications into various credit tiers (S, A, B, C, D, and E). Credit tiers help determine our primary indication of credit quality and pricing, and are also communicated to the dealer that submitted the application. This process is built on long established credit risk fundamentals to determine both the applicant's ability and willingness to repay. While advances in excess of 100% of the vehicle collateral value at loan origination-notwithstanding cash down and vehicle trade in value-are typical in the industry (primarily due to additional costs such as mechanical warranty contracts, taxes, license, and title fees), our pricing, risk, and underwriting processes are rooted in statistical analysis to manage this risk.\nOur underwriting process uses a combination of automated strategies and manual evaluation by an experienced team of dedicated underwriters. We have developed an automated process to expedite the review of applications with various combinations of credit factors that we have observed over time to substantially outperform or underperform in terms of net credit losses. As a result, automated decisions are based on many clusters of credit factors rather than a small set of benchmark characteristics. Automated approvals are primarily limited to the higher-quality credit tiers and automated rejections to lower-quality credit tiers. Underwriting is also governed by our credit policies, which set forth guidelines such as acceptable transaction parameters and verification requirements. For higher-risk approved transactions, these guidelines require verification of details such as applicant income and employment through documentation provided by the applicant or other data sources.\nUnderwriters have a limited ability to approve exceptions to the guidelines in our credit policies. For example, an exception may be approved to allow a term or a ratio of payment-to-income, debt-to-income, or LTV greater than that in the guidelines. Exceptions must be approved by underwriters with appropriate approval authority and generally are based on compensating factors. We monitor exceptions with the goal of limiting them to a small portion of approved applications and originated loans, and rarely permit more than a single exception to avoid layered risk.\nConsumer Automotive Financing\nNew- and used-vehicle consumer financing through dealerships takes one of two forms: retail installment sales contracts (retail contracts) and operating lease contracts. We purchase retail contracts for new and used vehicles and operating lease contracts from dealers after those contracts are executed by the dealers and the consumers. Our consumer automotive financing operations generate revenue primarily through finance charges on retail contracts and rental payments on operating lease contracts. In connection with operating lease contracts, we recognize depreciation expense on the vehicle over the operating lease contract period and we may also recognize a gain or loss on the remarketing of the vehicle at the end of the lease.\nThe amount we pay a dealer for a retail contract is based on the rate of finance charge agreed by the dealer and customer, the negotiated purchase price of the vehicle, any other products such as service contracts, less any vehicle trade-in value, any down payment from the consumer, and any available automotive manufacturer incentives. Under the retail contract, the consumer is obligated to make payments in an amount equal to the purchase price of the vehicle (less any trade-in or down payment) plus finance charges at a rate negotiated between the consumer and the dealer. In addition, the consumer is responsible for charges related to past-due payments. Consistent with industry practice, when we purchase the retail contract, we pay the dealer at a rate discounted below the rate agreed by the dealer and the consumer (generally described in the industry as the buy rate\u201d). Our agreements with dealers limit the amount of the discount that we will accept. Although we do not own the vehicles that we finance through retail contracts, our agreements require that we hold a perfected security interest in those vehicles.\nWith respect to consumer leasing, we purchase operating lease contracts and the associated vehicles from dealerships after those contracts are executed by the dealers and the consumers. The amount we pay a dealer for an operating lease contract is based on the negotiated price for the vehicle, less any vehicle trade-in, any down payment from the consumer, and any available automotive manufacturer incentives. Under an operating lease, the consumer is obligated to make payments in amounts equal to the amount by which the negotiated purchase price of the vehicle (less any trade-in value, down payment, or any available manufacturer incentives) exceeds the contract residual value (including residual support) of the vehicle at lease termination, plus operating lease rental charges. The consumer is also generally responsible for charges related to past-due payments, excess mileage, excessive wear and tear, and certain disposal fees where applicable. At contract inception, we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle. This evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model, which includes variables such as vehicle age, expected mileage, seasonality, segment factors, vehicle type, economic indicators, production cycle, automotive manufacturer incentives, and shifts in used vehicle supply. This internally generated data is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nPeriodically, we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on then-current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense, if appropriate, over the remaining life of the contract. At termination, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense.\nOur standard consumer operating lease contract, SmartLease, requires a monthly payment by the consumer. We also offer an alternative leasing plan, SmartLease Plus, which requires one up-front payment of all operating lease amounts at the time the consumer takes possession of the vehicle.\nOur standard consumer lease contracts are operating leases; therefore, credit losses on the operating lease portfolio are not as significant as losses on retail contracts because lease credit losses are primarily limited to past-due payments and assessed fees. Since some of these fees are not assessed until the vehicle is returned, these losses on the operating lease portfolio are correlated with lease termination volume. Operating lease accounts over 30 days past due represented 1.34% and 1.48% of the portfolio at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nWith respect to all financed vehicles, whether subject to a retail contract or an operating lease contract, we require that property damage insurance be obtained by the consumer. In addition, for operating lease contracts, we require that bodily injury, collision, and comprehensive insurance be obtained by the consumer.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our portfolio yield for consumer automotive loans increased 46 basis points relative to the year ended December 31, 2018. We set our buy rates using a granular, risk-based methodology factoring in several variables including interest costs, projected net average annualized loss rates at the time of origination, anticipated operating costs, and targeted return on equity. Over the past several years, we have continued to focus on optimizing pricing relative to market interest rates as well as portfolio diversification and the used-vehicle segment, primarily through franchised dealers, which has contributed to higher yields on our consumer automotive loan portfolio. Commensurate with this shift in origination mix, we continue to maintain consistent, disciplined underwriting within our new and used consumer automotive loan originations. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.4 billion, or approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to $8.3 billion, or approximately 11.7% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table presents retail loan originations by credit tier and product

Consumer loans and operating leases with FICO\u00ae Scores of less than 540 continued to compose only 1% of total originations for the year ended December 31, 2019. Nonprime applications that are not automatically declined by our proprietary credit-scoring models for risk reasons are manually reviewed and decisioned by an experienced underwriting team. Nonprime applications are subject to more stringent underwriting criteria (for example, minimum payment-to-income ratio and vehicle mileage, and maximum amount financed), and our nonprime loan portfolio generally does not include any loans with a term of 76 months or more. For discussion of our credit-risk-management practices and performance, refer to the section titled Risk Management.\nManufacturer Marketing Incentives\nAutomotive manufacturers may elect to sponsor incentive programs on retail contracts and operating leases by subsidizing finance rates below market rates. These marketing incentives are also referred to as rate support or subvention. When an automotive manufacturer subsidizes the finance rate, we are compensated at contract inception for the present value of the difference between the manufacturer-supported customer rate and our standard rate. For a retail contract, we defer and recognize this amount as a yield adjustment over the life of the contract. For an operating lease contract, this payment reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset.\nAutomotive manufacturers may also elect to sponsor incentives, referred to as residual support, on operating leases. When an automotive manufacturer provides residual support, we receive payment at contract inception that increases the contractual operating lease residual value resulting in a lower operating lease payment from the customer. The payment received from the automotive manufacturer reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset. Other operating lease incentive programs sponsored by automotive manufacturers may be made at contract inception indirectly through dealers, which also reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset.\nUnder what the automotive finance industry refers to as pull-ahead programs,\u201d consumers may be encouraged by the manufacturer to terminate operating leases early in conjunction with the acquisition of a new vehicle. As part of these programs, we waive all or a portion of\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nthe customer's remaining payment obligation. Under most programs, the automotive manufacturer compensates us for a portion of the foregone revenue from the waived payments. This compensation may be partially offset to the extent that our remarketing sales proceeds are higher than otherwise would be realized if the vehicle had been remarketed upon contract maturity.\nServicing\nWe have historically serviced all retail contracts and operating leases we originated. However, our expansion into direct-to-consumer lending and other relationships have resulted in the employment of third-party servicers for a small portion of the portfolio. On occasion, we have sold a portion of the retail contracts we originated through whole-loan sales and securitizations, but generally retained the right to service and earn a servicing fee for our servicing functions.\nServicing activities consist largely of collecting and processing customer payments, responding to customer concerns and inquiries, processing customer requests (including those for payoff quotes, total-loss handling, and payment modifications), maintaining a perfected security interest in the financed vehicle, engaging in collections activity, and disposing of off-lease and repossessed vehicles. Servicing activities are generally consistent across our Automotive Finance operations; however, certain practices may be influenced by state laws.\nOur customers have the option to receive monthly billing statements and remit payment by mail or through electronic fund transfers, or to establish online web-based account administration through Ally Auto Online Services. Customer payments are processed by regional third-party processing centers that electronically transfer payment information to customers' accounts.\nCollections activity includes initiating contact with customers who fail to comply with the terms of the retail contract or operating lease agreement by sending reminder notices or contacting customers via various channels when an account becomes 3 to 20 days past due. The type of collection treatment and level of intensity increases as the account becomes more delinquent. The nature and timing of these activities depend on the repayment risk of the account.\nDuring the collections process, we may offer a payment extension to a customer experiencing temporary financial difficulty. A payment extension enables the customer to delay monthly payments for 30, 60, or 90 days. Extensions granted to a customer typically do not exceed 90 days in the aggregate during any 12-month period or 180 days in aggregate over the life of the contract. During the extension period, finance charges continue to accrue. If the customer's financial difficulty is not temporary but we believe the customer is willing and able to repay their loan at a lower payment amount, we may offer to modify the remaining obligation, extending the term and lowering the scheduled monthly payment. In those cases, the outstanding balance generally remains unchanged. The use of extensions and modifications helps us mitigate financial loss. Extensions may assist in cases where we believe the customer will recover from short-term financial difficulty and resume regularly scheduled payments. Modifications may also be utilized in cases where we believe customers can fulfill the obligation with lower payments over a longer period. Before offering an extension or modification, we evaluate and take into account the capacity of the customer to meet the revised payment terms. Generally, we do not consider extensions that fall within our policy guidelines to represent more than an insignificant delay in payment, and therefore, they are not considered a Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR). Although the granting of an extension could delay the eventual charge-off of an account, typically we are able to repossess and sell the related collateral, thereby mitigating the loss. At December 31, 2019, 10.6% of the total amount outstanding in the servicing portfolio had been granted an extension or was rewritten, compared to 11.3% at December 31, 2018.\nSubject to legal considerations, we normally begin repossession activity once an account is at least eighty-five days past due. Repossession may occur earlier if we determine the customer is unwilling to pay, the vehicle is in danger of being damaged or hidden, or the customer voluntarily surrenders the vehicle. Approved third-party repossession vendors handle the repossession activity. Generally, after repossession, the customer is given a period of time to redeem the vehicle or reinstate the contract by paying off the account or bringing the account current, respectively. If the vehicle is not redeemed or the contract is not reinstated, the vehicle is sold at auction. If the proceeds do not cover the unpaid balance, including unpaid earned finance charges and allowable expenses, the resulting deficiency is charged-off. Asset recovery centers pursue collections on accounts that have been charged-off, including those accounts where the vehicle was repossessed, and skip accounts where the vehicle cannot be located.\nOur total consumer automotive serviced portfolio was $80.6 billion and $79.7 billion at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively, compared to our consumer automotive on-balance-sheet serviced portfolio of $80.0 billion and $77.8 billion.\nRemarketing and Sales of Leased Vehicles\nWhen we acquire an operating lease, we assume ownership of the vehicle from the dealer. Neither the consumer nor the dealer is responsible for the value of the vehicle at the time of lease termination. When vehicles are not purchased by customers or the receiving dealer at scheduled lease termination, the vehicle is returned to us for remarketing. We generally bear the risk of loss to the extent the value of a leased vehicle upon remarketing is below the expected residual value. Our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and the proceeds realized from vehicle sales. Our methods of vehicle sales at lease termination primarily include the following:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sale to dealer - After the lessee declines an option to purchase the off-lease vehicle, the dealer who accepts it has the opportunity to purchase it directly from us at a price we define.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Internet auctions - Once the lessee and the dealer decline to purchase the off-lease vehicle, we offer it to dealers and other third parties through our proprietary internet site (SmartAuction). Through SmartAuction, we seek to maximize the net sales proceeds from an off-lease vehicle by reducing the time between vehicle return and ultimate disposition, reducing holding costs, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nbroadening the number of prospective buyers. We use SmartAuction for our own vehicles and make it available for third-party use. We earn a service fee for every third-party vehicle sold through SmartAuction, which includes the cost of ClearGuard coverage, our protection product designed to assist in minimizing the risk to dealers of arbitration claims for eligible vehicles. In 2019, approximately 270,000 vehicles were sold through SmartAuction.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Physical auctions - We dispose of an off-lease vehicle not purchased at termination by the lessee or dealer or sold on SmartAuction through traditional third-party, physical auctions. We are responsible for handling decisions at the auction including arranging for inspections, authorizing repairs and reconditioning, and determining whether bids received at auction should be accepted.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We employ an internal team, including statisticians, to manage our analysis of projected used vehicle values and residual risk. This team aids in the pricing of new operating leases, managing the disposal process including vehicle concentration risk, geographic optimization of vehicles to maximize gains, disposal platform (internet vs. physical), and evaluating our residual risk on a real-time basis. This team tracks market movements of used vehicles using data down to the VIN level including trim and options, vehicle age, mileage, and seasonality factors that we feel are more relevant than other published indices (for example, Manheim, NADA). This analysis includes vehicles sold on our SmartAuction platform, as well as vehicles sold through Manheim, ADESA, and over 200 independent physical auction sites. We believe this analysis gives us a competitive advantage over our peers.\nCommercial Automotive Financing\nAutomotive Wholesale Dealer Financing\nOne of the most important aspects of our dealer relationships is providing wholesale floorplan financing for new- and used-vehicle inventories at dealerships. Wholesale floorplan financing, including syndicated loan arrangements, represents the largest portion of our commercial automotive financing business and is the primary source of funding for dealers' purchases of new and used vehicles.\nWholesale floorplan financing is generally extended in the form of lines of credit to individual dealers. These lines of credit are secured by the vehicles financed and all other vehicle inventory, which provide strong collateral protection in the event of dealership default. Additional collateral (for example, blanket lien over all dealership assets) or other credit enhancements (for example, personal guarantees from dealership owners) are generally obtained to further mitigate credit risk. Furthermore, in some cases, we may benefit from situations where an automotive manufacturer repurchases vehicles. These repurchases may serve as an additional layer of protection in the event of repossession of dealership new-vehicle inventory or dealership franchise termination. The amount we advance to dealers for a new vehicle is equal to 100% of the manufacturer's wholesale invoice price. The amount we advance to dealers for a used vehicle is typically 90-100% of the dealer's cost of acquiring it. Interest on wholesale floorplan financing is generally payable monthly. The majority of wholesale floorplan financing is structured to yield interest at a floating rate indexed to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) or the Prime Rate. The rate for a particular dealer is based on, among other things, competitive factors, the size of the account, and the dealer's creditworthiness. Additionally, under our Ally Dealer Rewards Program, dealers benefit in certain circumstances from wholesale-floorplan-financing incentives, which we credit and account for as a reduction to interest income in the period they are earned.\nUnder our wholesale-floorplan-financing agreement, a dealership is generally required to pay the principal amount financed for a vehicle within a specified number of days following the dealership's sale or lease of the vehicle. The agreement also affords us the right to demand payment of all amounts owed under the wholesale credit line at any time. We, however, generally make this demand only if we terminate the credit line, the dealer defaults, or a risk-based reason exists to do so.\nCommercial Wholesale Financing Volume\nThe following table presents the percentage of average balance of our commercial wholesale floorplan finance receivables, in dollars, by product type and by channel.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average balance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GM new vehicles\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chrysler new vehicles\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth new vehicles\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used vehicles\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial wholesale finance receivables\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage commercial wholesale financing receivables outstanding decreased $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of GM dealer relationships due to the competitive environment across the automotive lending market and reduced dealer inventory levels, partially offset by higher average vehicle prices. Dealer inventory levels are dependent on a number of factors, including manufacturer production schedules and vehicle mix, sales incentives, and industry sales-all of which can influence future wholesale balances. Manufacturer production and corresponding dealer stock levels, as well as dealer penetration levels, may continue to influence our future wholesale balances during 2020.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOther Commercial Automotive Financing\nWe also provide other forms of commercial financing for the automotive industry including automotive dealer term and revolving loans and automotive fleet financing. Automotive dealer term and revolving loans are loans that we make to dealers to finance other aspects of the dealership business, including acquisitions. These loans are usually secured by real estate or other dealership assets and are typically personally guaranteed by the individual owners of the dealership. Additionally, we generally also have cross-collateral and cross-default provisions in place with dealers. Automotive fleet financing credit lines may be obtained by dealers, their affiliates, and other independent companies that are used to purchase vehicles, which they lease or rent to others. The average balances of other commercial automotive loans decreased 6% to $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nServicing and Monitoring\nWe service all of the wholesale credit lines in our portfolio and the wholesale automotive finance receivables that we have securitized. A statement setting forth billing and account information is distributed on a monthly basis to each dealer. Interest and other nonprincipal charges are billed in arrears and are required to be paid immediately upon receipt of the monthly billing statement. Generally, dealers remit payments to us through ACH transactions initiated by the dealer through a secure web application.\nWe manage risk related to wholesale floorplan financing by assessing dealership borrowers using a proprietary model based on various factors, including their capital sufficiency, operating performance, and credit and payment history. This model assigns dealership borrowers a risk rating that affects the amount of the line of credit and the ongoing risk management of the account. We monitor the level of borrowing under each dealer's credit line daily. We may adjust the dealer's credit line if warranted, based on the dealership's vehicle sales rate, and temporarily suspend the granting of additional credit, or take other actions following evaluation and analysis of the dealer's financial condition.\nWe periodically inspect and verify the existence of dealer vehicle inventories. The timing of these collateral audits varies, and no advance notice is given to the dealer. Among other things, audits are intended to assess dealer compliance with the financing agreement and confirm the status of our collateral.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nInsurance\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of our Insurance operations.

The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by $88 million of net unrealized gains on investments due to favorable market conditions within our equity portfolio, compared to net unrealized losses of $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInsurance premiums and service revenue earned was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to vehicle inventory insurance portfolio growth and rate increases.\nInsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled $321 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $295 million in 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by vehicle inventory insurance portfolio growth and higher VSC, GAP, and other policies in force. Total acquisition and underwriting expense increased $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to an increase in insurance commissions expense, driven by growth in our written insurance premiums and service revenue. Growth in insurance premiums and service revenue earned outpaced expense increases, which led to a decrease in the combined ratio to 92.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 92.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We use these investments to satisfy our obligations related to future claims at the time these claims are settled. Our Insurance operations have an Investment Committee, which develops guidelines and strategies for these investments. The guidelines established by this committee reflect our risk appetite, liquidity requirements, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our Insurance operations cash and investment portfolio at fair value.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>644\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>896\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury and federal agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>460\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. States and political subdivisions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign government\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency mortgage-backed residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nMortgage Finance\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the activities of our Mortgage Finance operations.

The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to higher prepayment activity, an increase in provision for loan losses, and higher noninterest expense driven primarily by continued asset growth. The decrease was partially offset by growth in our mortgage loan portfolio and an increase in the net gain on sale of mortgage loans.\nNet financing revenue and other interest income was $171 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $179 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to accelerated premium amortization on purchased loans due to higher prepayment activity driven by a lower interest rate environment, partially offset by increased loan balances as a result of bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans and direct-to-consumer originations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased $3.5 billion of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties and originated $2.0 billion of mortgage loans held-for-investment, compared to $4.4 billion and $401 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain on sale of mortgage loans, net, was $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by higher direct-to-consumer mortgage originations and the subsequent sale of these loans to our fulfillment provider, and the execution of whole-loan sales during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we originated $738 million of loans held-for-sale compared to $302 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of reserve releases for the year ended December 31, 2018, that did not reoccur.\nTotal noninterest expense was $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The increase was due primarily to higher net financing revenue and other interest income resulting from higher asset levels, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses recognized during the first quarter of 2019.\nNet financing revenue and other interest income was $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $204 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the growth of our loan portfolio, represented by a 23% increase in the gross carrying value of finance receivables and loans. Growth in the portfolio was primarily driven by asset-based lending, including our lender finance vertical, which provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct lending activities.\nOther revenue was $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by higher unrealized losses on equity securities in 2018, partially offset by lower fee income.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by higher reserves associated with favorable credit ratings migration in 2018 and portfolio growth, as well as a $6 million recovery of a previously charged-off loan recognized during the second quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur.\nTotal noninterest expense was $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $86 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense and other noninterest costs associated with growth in the business.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nCredit Portfolio\nThe following table presents loans held-for-sale, the gross carrying value of finance receivables and loans outstanding, unfunded commitments to lend, and total serviced loans of our Corporate Finance operations.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans held-for-sale, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance receivables and loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded lending commitments (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total serviced loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Includes unused revolving credit line commitments for loans held-for-sale and finance receivables and loans, signed commitment letters, and standby letter of credit facilities, which are issued on behalf of clients and may contingently require us to make payments to a third-party beneficiary in the event of a draw by the beneficiary thereunder.

The increase in total financing revenue and other interest income from our investment securities portfolio and higher other revenue was more than offset by higher funding costs from higher market rates and deposit growth.\nFinancing revenue and other interest income was $960 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $815 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by growth in the size of the investment portfolio and higher interest and dividends from investment securities, primarily as a result of higher balances.\nTotal interest expense was $932 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $631 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased interest on deposits resulting from higher market rates and deposit growth, partially offset by a decrease in higher-cost secured and unsecured debt borrowings.\nTotal other revenue was $171 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $119 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased realized investment gains, partially offset by lower income related to certain equity hedges, and lower commission revenues.\nTotal assets were $36.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $34.0 billion as of December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily the result of growth in our available-for-sale securities portfolio. The increase was partially offset by a decline in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio and the continued runoff of our legacy mortgage portfolio.

We retain the majority of our consumer automotive loans as they complement our core business model, but we do sell loans from time to time on an opportunistic basis. We ultimately manage the associated risks based on the underlying economics of the exposure. Our operating lease residual risk may be more volatile than credit risk in stressed macroeconomic scenarios.

We are exposed to fluctuations in the expected residual value upon remarketing the vehicle at the end of the lease, and as such at contract inception, we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle. This evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model, which includes variables such as age, expected mileage, seasonality, segment factors, vehicle type, economic indicators, production cycle, automotive manufacturer incentives, and shifts in used vehicle supply. This internally generated data is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. Periodically, we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense appropriately over the remaining life of the contract. At termination, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense. The balance sheet reflects both the operating lease asset as well as any associated rent receivables. The operating lease rent receivable is accrued when collection is reasonably assured and presented as a component of other assets. The operating lease asset is reviewed for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates within this MD&A and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from an obligor not meeting its contractual obligations to us. Credit risk includes consumer credit risk, commercial credit risk, and counterparty credit risk.\nCredit risk is a major source of potential economic loss to us. Credit risk is monitored by the risk committees, executive leadership team, and our associates. Together, they oversee credit decisioning, account servicing activities, and credit-risk-management processes, and manage credit risk exposures within our risk appetite. In addition, our Loan Review Group provides an independent assessment of the quality of our credit portfolios and credit-risk-management practices, and reports its findings to the RC on a regular basis.\nTo mitigate risk, we have implemented specific policies and practices across business lines, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative analyses. This reflects our commitment to maintaining an independent and ongoing assessment of credit risk and credit quality. Our policies require an objective and timely assessment of the overall quality of the consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios. This includes the identification of relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolios, segments of the portfolios that are potential problem areas, loans and operating leases with potential credit weaknesses, and the assessment of the adequacy of internal credit risk policies and procedures. Our consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios are subject to regular stress tests that are based on plausible, but unexpected, economic scenarios to assess how the portfolios may perform in a severe economic downturn. In addition, we establish and maintain underwriting policies and limits across our portfolios and higher risk segments (for example, nonprime) based on our risk appetite.\nAnother important aspect to managing credit risk involves the need to carefully monitor and manage the performance and pricing of our loan products with the aim of generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns. When considering pricing, various granular risk-based factors are considered such as expected loss rates, loss volatility, anticipated operating costs, and targeted returns on equity. We carefully monitor credit losses and trends in credit losses relative to expected credit losses at contract inception. We closely monitor our loan performance and profitability in light of forecasted economic conditions and manage credit risk and expectations of losses in the portfolio.\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, the source of repayment, the underlying collateral, and current market conditions. We monitor the credit risk profile of individual borrowers, various segmentations (for example, geographic region, product type, industry segment), as well as the aggregate portfolio. We perform quarterly analyses of the consumer automotive, consumer mortgage, consumer other, and commercial portfolios using a range of indicators to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on historical and current trends. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAdditionally, we utilize numerous collection strategies to mitigate loss and provide ongoing support to customers in financial distress. For consumer automotive loans, we work with customers when they become delinquent on their monthly payment. In lieu of repossessing their vehicle, we may offer several types of assistance to aid our customers based on their willingness and ability to repay their loan. Loss mitigation may include payment extensions and rewrites of the loan terms. For mortgage loans, as part of certain programs, we offer mortgage loan modifications to qualified borrowers. These programs are in place to provide support to our mortgage customers in financial distress, including principal forgiveness, maturity extensions, delinquent interest capitalization, and changes to contractual interest rates.\nFurthermore, we manage our credit exposure to financial counterparties based on the risk profile of the counterparty. Within our policies we have established standards and requirements for managing counterparty risk exposures in a safe and sound manner. Counterparty credit risk is derived from multiple exposure types including derivatives, securities trading, securities financing transactions, financial futures, cash balances (for example, due from depository institutions, restricted accounts, and cash equivalents), and investment in debt securities. For more information on derivative counterparty credit risk, refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe employ an internal team of economists to enhance our planning and forecasting capabilities. This team conducts industry and market research, monitors economic risks, and helps support various forms of scenario planning. This group closely monitors macroeconomic trends given the nature of our business and the potential impacts on our exposure to credit risk. During 2019, the U.S. economy continued to modestly expand, led by consumer spending. The labor market remained robust during the year, with the unemployment rate at 3.5% as of December 31, 2019. Within the U.S. automotive market, new light vehicle sales have moderated from both historic highs and year-over-year pace, to a total of 17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect to experience modest downward pressure on used vehicle values during 2020.\nConsumer Credit Portfolio\nOur consumer loan portfolio primarily consists of automotive loans, first-lien mortgages, home equity loans and personal loans. Loan losses in our consumer loan portfolio are influenced by general business and economic conditions including unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings, and home and used vehicle prices. Additionally, our consumer credit exposure is significantly concentrated in automotive lending.\nCredit risk management for the consumer loan portfolio begins with the initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit life cycle. We manage consumer credit risk through our loan origination and underwriting policies and the credit approval process. We use proprietary credit-scoring models to differentiate the expected default rates of credit applicants enabling us to better evaluate credit applications for approval and to tailor the pricing and financing structure according to this assessment of credit risk. We continuously monitor and routinely update the inputs of the credit scoring models. These and other actions mitigate but do not eliminate credit risk. Ineffective evaluations of a borrower's creditworthiness, fraud, or changes in the applicant's financial condition after approval could negatively affect the quality of our portfolio, resulting in loan losses.\nOur servicing activities are another important factor in managing consumer credit risk. Servicing activities consist of collecting and processing customer payments, responding to customer concerns and inquiries, processing customer requests (including those for payoff quotes, total-loss handling, and payment modifications), maintaining a perfected security interest in the financed vehicle, engaging in collections activity, and disposing of off-lease and repossessed vehicles. Servicing activities are generally consistent across our Automotive Finance operations; however, certain practices may be influenced by state laws.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the credit performance of the consumer loan portfolio reflected our underwriting strategy to originate a diversified portfolio of consumer automotive loan assets, including new, used, prime and nonprime finance receivables and loans, as well as high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans that are acquired through bulk loan purchases and direct-to-consumer mortgage originations. We also further diversified our consumer portfolio to include personal lending through the acquisition of Health Credit Services during the fourth quarter of 2019. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses represented approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019, compared to approximately 11.7% at December 31, 2018.

The increase consists of $1.9 billion of consumer automotive finance receivables and loans, $621 million of consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans, and $201 million of consumer other finance receivables and loans. The increase in consumer automotive finance receivables and loans was primarily related to continued momentum in our used vehicle lending. The increase in consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans was primarily due to the execution of bulk loan purchases totaling $3.5 billion and direct-to-consumer held-for-investment originations of $2.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. These increases were partially offset by portfolio run-off and the transfer of $940 million of consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans to held-for-sale, of which $864 million were sold during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in consumer other finance receivables and loans was due to the acquisition of Health Credit Services during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nTotal consumer nonperforming finance receivables and loans at December 31, 2019, increased $78 million to $821 million from December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase of $98 million of consumer automotive finance receivables and loans and a decrease of $22 million of consumer mortgage nonperforming finance receivables and loans. The increase in nonperforming consumer automotive finance receivables and loans was primarily due to higher delinquency rates as part of our continued diversification strategy and as a result of portfolio growth. The increase was also modestly impacted by a brief scheduled moratorium on all collections and repossession activities at the end of 2019 prior to the conversion to a new servicing and accounting technology platform during the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in nonperforming consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans was driven by the continued run-off of our legacy mortgage portfolio. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Nonperforming consumer finance receivables and loans as a percentage of total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans were 0.9% at both December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018.\nTotal consumer TDRs outstanding at December 31, 2019, increased $20 million since December 31, 2018, to $746 million. Results reflect a $42 million increase in our consumer automotive loan portfolio, largely offset by a $22 million decrease in our consumer mortgage loan portfolio, driven by our legacy mortgage portfolio. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nConsumer automotive loans accruing and past due 30 days or more increased $115 million to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018, driven by growth in the overall size of the consumer automotive loan portfolio, as well as higher delinquency rates as part of our continued diversification strategy.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table includes consumer net charge-offs from finance receivables and loans at gross carrying value and related ratios.\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net charge-offs (recoveries)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net charge-off ratios (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer automotive\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Finance\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage - Legacy\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total consumer mortgage\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer other\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total consumer finance receivables and loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding finance receivables and loans excluding loans measured at fair value and loans held-for-sale during the period for each loan category.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our net charge-offs from total consumer finance receivables and loans were $927 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $937 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by our consumer mortgage loan portfolio where we experienced strong credit performance as the legacy mortgage portfolio continues to run-off and we continue to grow our Mortgage Finance business. Net charge-offs for our consumer automotive portfolio increased slightly by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Results were primarily driven by the relatively consistent credit profile of our consumer automotive loan portfolio which experienced strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting and higher recoveries. Additionally, we experienced a modest reduction in net charge-offs due to a brief scheduled moratorium on all collections and repossession activities at the end of 2019 prior to the conversion to a new servicing and accounting technology platform during the first quarter of 2020.\nThe following table summarizes total consumer loan originations for the periods shown.

The highest concentrations of consumer loans are in California and Texas, which represented an aggregate of 24.9% and 25.4% of our total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Our consumer mortgage loan portfolio concentration within California, which is primarily composed of high-quality jumbo mortgage loans, generally aligns to the California share of jumbo mortgages nationally.\nRepossessed and Foreclosed Assets\nWe classify an asset as repossessed or foreclosed, which is included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, when physical possession of the collateral is taken. We dispose of the acquired collateral in a timely fashion in accordance with regulatory requirements. For more information on repossessed and foreclosed assets, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRepossessed consumer automotive loan assets in our Automotive Finance operations increased $11 million from December 31, 2018, to $147 million at December 31, 2019. Foreclosed mortgage assets decreased $2 million from December 31, 2018, to $9 million at December 31, 2019.\nCommercial Credit Portfolio\nOur commercial portfolio consists primarily of automotive loans through the extension of wholesale floorplan financing, automotive dealer term real estate loans, and automotive fleet financing, as well as other commercial loans including our Corporate Finance lending portfolio. Wholesale floorplan loans are secured by the vehicles financed (and all other vehicle inventory), which provides strong collateral protection in the event of dealership default. Additional collateral (for example, a blanket lien over all dealership assets) or other credit enhancements (for example, personal guarantees from dealership owners) are typically obtained to further mitigate credit risk. Furthermore, in some cases, we may benefit from situations where an automotive manufacturer repurchases vehicles. These repurchases may serve as an additional layer of protection in the event of repossession of new-vehicle dealership inventory or dealership franchise termination.\nWithin our commercial portfolio, we utilize proprietary risk rating models that are fundamental to managing credit risk exposure consistently across various types of commercial borrowers and captures critical risk factors for each borrower. The ratings are used for many areas of credit risk management, including loan origination, portfolio risk monitoring, management reporting, and loan loss reserves analyses. Therefore, the rating systems are critical to an effective and consistent credit-risk-management framework.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the credit performance of the commercial portfolio remained strong as nonperforming finance receivables and loans decreased, and our net charge-offs remained low.

The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of GM dealer relationships due to the competitive environment across the automotive lending market and reduced dealer inventory levels. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Corporate Finance portfolio that was primarily driven by asset-based lending, including our lender finance vertical, which provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct lending activities.\nTotal commercial nonperforming finance receivables and loans were $215 million at December 31, 2019, reflecting a decrease of $134 million when compared to December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to reduced exposure to one large automotive dealer group that was placed into default in the fourth quarter of 2018. Nonperforming commercial finance receivables and loans as a percentage of outstanding commercial finance receivables and loans decreased to 0.6% at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.8% at December 31, 2018.\nTotal commercial TDRs outstanding at December 31, 2019, increased $35 million since December 31, 2018, to $121 million, reflecting an increase of $20 million in our Corporate Finance portfolio and an increase of $15 million in our commercial automotive portfolio. The increase in our Corporate Finance portfolio was primarily driven by three accounts being classified as TDRs, partially offset by the partial liquidation and charge-off of two accounts. The increase in our commercial automotive portfolio was primarily driven by TDRs involving one large automotive dealer group that was placed into default in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Charge-off activity during 2019 was in line with expectations for these businesses.\nCommercial Real Estate\nThe commercial real estate portfolio consists of finance receivables and loans issued primarily to automotive dealers.

The increase in our consumer automotive allowance was primarily driven by portfolio growth as finance receivable balances are up $1.9 billion compared to\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\n2018. The decrease in the consumer mortgage allowance was primarily driven by overall lower net charge-offs resulting from legacy mortgage portfolio run-off and strong credit performance, partially offset by year-over-year growth of $1.0 billion in our Mortgage Finance receivables portfolio.\nThe allowance for commercial loan losses declined $8 million at December 31, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in provision for loan losses was primarily driven by reserve\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nreductions during the year ended December 31, 2018, associated with hurricane activity experienced during 2017 in our consumer automotive loan portfolio. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting and higher recoveries. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2019, provision expense was incurred in our consumer other portfolio due to the acquisition of Health Credit Services. The provision for consumer mortgage loan losses increased $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by reserve releases for the year ended December 31, 2018, that did not repeat, partially offset by lower net charge-offs as the legacy mortgage portfolio continues to run-off. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance in our consumer mortgage portfolio.\nThe provision for commercial loan losses increased $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by our Corporate Finance portfolio which experienced higher reserves associated with favorable credit ratings migration in 2018 and portfolio growth, as well as a $6 million recovery of a previously charged-off loan recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018, that did not reoccur. Overall credit performance in the Corporate Finance portfolio remains stable.\nImplementation of CECL\nAlly will adopt CECL on January 1, 2020, as further described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon implementation of CECL we expect to recognize a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance of approximately $1.0 billion, net of income tax, which reflects a pre-tax increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $1.3 billion. This increase is almost exclusively driven by our consumer automotive loan portfolio. We plan to phase in the day-one impact of CECL into regulatory capital in accordance with regulatory capital rules which permit us to phase in 25% of the impact of CECL in 2020 and an additional 25% each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2023. We estimate that the implementation of CECL will reduce our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio by 17 to 19 basis points during the first quarter of 2020.\nUnder CECL, our modeling process will incorporate the following considerations:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A single forecast scenario for macroeconomic factors incorporated into the modeling process;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over a 24-month period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Data from the historical mean will be calculated from January 2008 through the most current period which includes data points from the most recent recessionary period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Insurance/Underwriting Risk\nThe underwriting of our VSCs, VMCs, GAP, and insurance policies includes an assessment of the risk to determine acceptability and categorization for appropriate pricing. The acceptability of a particular risk is based on expected losses, expenses and other factors specific to the product in question. With respect to VSCs, considerations include the quality of the vehicles produced, the price of replacement parts, repair labor rates, and new model introductions. Insurance risk also includes event risk, which is synonymous with pure risk, hazard risk, or insurance risk, and presents no chance of gain, only of loss.\nWe mitigate losses by the active management of claim settlement activities using experienced claims personnel and the evaluation of current period reported claims. Losses for these events may be compared to prior claims experience, expected claims, or loss expenses from similar incidents to assess the reasonableness of incurred losses.\nIn some instances, reinsurance is used to reduce the risk associated with volatile business lines, such as catastrophe risk in vehicle inventory insurance. Our vehicle inventory insurance product is covered by excess-of-loss protection, including catastrophe coverage for weather-related events. In addition, loss control techniques such as storm path monitoring to assist dealers in preparing for severe weather help to mitigate loss potential.\nIn accordance with industry and accounting practices and applicable insurance laws and regulatory requirements, we maintain reserves for reported losses, losses incurred but not reported, losses expected to be incurred in the future for contracts in force and loss adjustment expenses. The estimated values of our prior reported loss reserves and changes to the estimated values are routinely monitored by credentialed actuaries. Our reserve estimates are regularly reviewed by management; however, since the reserves are based on estimates and numerous assumptions, the ultimate liability may differ from the amount estimated.\nMarket Risk\nOur financing, investing, and insurance activities give rise to market risk, or the potential change in the value of our assets (including securities, assets held-for-sale, loans and operating leases) and liabilities (including deposits and debt) due to movements in market variables such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign-exchange rates, equity prices, and off-lease vehicle prices.\nThe impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on our assets and liabilities (interest rate risk) represents an exposure to market risk. We primarily use interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate risk exposure.\nThe fair value of our credit-sensitive assets is also exposed to credit spread risk. Credit spread is the amount of additional return over the benchmark interest rates that an investor would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. Generally, an increase in credit spreads would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nWe are also exposed to foreign-currency risk arising from foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily in Canada. We enter into hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk.\nWe also have exposure to changes in the value of equity securities. We have exposure to equity securities with readily determinable fair values primarily related to our Insurance operations. For such equity securities, we use equity derivatives to manage our exposure to equity price fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed to changes in the value of other equity investments without readily determinable fair market values. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We may experience changes in the valuation of these investments, which may cause volatility in our earnings.\nThe composition of our balance sheet, including shorter-duration consumer automotive loans and variable-rate commercial loans, coupled with the continued funding shift toward retail deposits, partially mitigates market risk. Additionally, we maintain risk-management controls that measure and monitor market risk using a variety of analytical techniques including market value, sensitivity analysis, and value at risk models. Refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLIBOR Transition\nIn July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intent to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of LIBOR, it is expected that a transition away from the use of LIBOR to alternative benchmark rates will occur by the end of 2021.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR or LIBOR-based rates will present risks to our business, as further described in the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report. In recognition of these risks and uncertainties, we have established an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks that may arise from the potential discontinuation of LIBOR. Our program spans across impacted business lines and functions to evaluate risks associated with the transition, while taking into account specific considerations related to our customers, products and instruments, and counterparty exposures. Through this program, we continue to assess and plan for potential impacts to our existing and future contracts with customers and counterparties, financial forecasts, operational processes, technology, modeling, and vendor relationships. We also continue to evaluate effective communication strategies to employ with our stakeholders, including relevant customers, counterparties, and vendors.\nWe have exposure to LIBOR-based contracts within certain of our finance receivables and loans, primarily related to commercial automotive loans, corporate finance loans, and mortgage loans, as well as certain investment securities and derivative contracts, among other arrangements. Our commercial automotive loan portfolio is primarily composed of wholesale floorplan financing to automotive dealers. Currently, a significant portion of our wholesale floorplan finance receivables are invoiced utilizing a LIBOR-based reference rate and, as such, represents our largest exposure to LIBOR based on notional dollar amount. Smaller loan portfolios that utilize contracts containing LIBOR-based reference rates include our corporate finance held-for-investment loans and lending commitments, and our adjustable-rate mortgage loans. With respect to our liabilities, we have issued trust preferred securities with an interest rate linked to LIBOR and also have secured facilities, certain asset-backed securitizations, and brokered certificates of deposit that also contain LIBOR-based reference rates.\nWith respect to selecting an alternative benchmark, we continue to evaluate the most appropriate course of action for each instrument that currently references LIBOR as well as any future instruments that reference a benchmark. For example, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a group convened by the FRB, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed purchase transactions. We are evaluating SOFR, among other alternatives and actions, as a potential alternative reference rate to LIBOR, and are taking steps to assess the operational, financial, and various other impacts this change could have to our business. Additionally, we continue to evaluate inclusion of appropriate fallback provisions to our contracts to adequately address alternatives in the absence of LIBOR, including evaluating the fallback language proposed by the ARRC for certain contracts. We will continue to actively monitor industry developments and their potential impact to us.\nWe are also actively assessing how the discontinuation of LIBOR could impact accounting and financial reporting including, but not limited to, potential impacts to our hedge accounting, valuation or modeling, or impacts associated with modifying the terms of our loan agreements or debt instruments with our customers or counterparties. We also continue to monitor the activities of the standard setters such as the FASB, which has issued proposed guidance and new accounting standard updates that provide certain relief related to the transition away from LIBOR. For example, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes, which permits the use of the OIS rate based on the SOFR to be designated as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. In addition, the FASB has recently issued proposed guidance that would help ease the potential effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The proposed guidance would offer optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to modifications of certain contracts, hedging relationships, or other transactions that would be driven by reference rate reform. We anticipate this guidance will be issued as a final ASU in the first half of 2020.\nAlly recognizes the significance of LIBOR cessation, and has devoted numerous resources throughout all levels of the organization to actively identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with this transition. Our program is also subject to the governance and oversight of our Board through the RC and certain executive committees including the ALCO and the ERMC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nFair Value Sensitivity Analysis\nThe following table presents a fair value sensitivity analysis of our assets and liabilities using isolated hypothetical movements in specific market rates. The analysis assumes adverse instantaneous, parallel shifts in market-exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and equity prices. Additionally, since only adverse fair value impacts are included, the natural offset between asset and liability rate sensitivities that arise within a diversified balance sheet, such as ours, may not be considered.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial instruments exposed to changes in:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 10% adverse change in rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign-currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 10% adverse change in rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>810\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 10% decrease in prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Refer to the section below titled Net Financing Revenue Sensitivity Analysis for information on the interest rate sensitivity of our financial instruments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net Financing Revenue Sensitivity Analysis\nInterest rate risk represents our most significant exposure to market risk. We actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings. We use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments.\nWe prepare forward-looking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth, asset/liability positioning, and interest rates based on the implied forward curve. The analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and non-contractual maturities. We continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing actions.\nSimulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast. The changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity. Our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets, liabilities, and off-balance-sheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities. Our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates.\nThe net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following 12 months. A number of alternative rate scenarios are tested, including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve. Management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types. Relative to our baseline forecast, which is based on the implied forward curve, our net financing revenue over the next 12 months would increase by $13 million if interest rates remain unchanged.\nThe following table presents the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net financing revenue over the next 12 months assuming 100 basis point and 200 basis point instantaneous parallel and gradual parallel shock increases, and assuming 100 basis point instantaneous parallel and gradual parallel shock decreases to the implied market forward curve as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018.\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gradual (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Instantaneous\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gradual (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Instantaneous\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over 12 months.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The implied forward rate curve was lower across all tenors compared to December 31, 2018, and includes one projected rate cut in the federal funds target rate in the forecast horizon. The impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections. As of December 31, 2019, our net interest income sensitivity in the +100 and +200 basis point instantaneous shock scenarios has primarily been impacted by a net decrease in pay-fixed interest rate swaps, partially offset by funding sources shifting from short-term market-based funding to deposits.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario has decreased as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to the lower pay-fixed interest rate swap notional referenced above as well as the addition of interest rate floor contracts, partially offset by increased mortgage prepayment risk in a lower interest rate environment.\nOur risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate debt instruments, and pay-fixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floating-rate debt instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we initiated a hedging program of interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floating-rate assets. The size, maturity, and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet, ALM objectives, and interest rate environment evolve over time.\nOperating Lease Residual Risk Management\nWe are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio. This operating lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be lower than the projection of these values used in establishing the pricing at lease inception. However, certain automotive manufacturers have provided their guarantee for portions of our residual exposure, as further described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operating lease portfolio, net of accumulated depreciation was $8.9 billion and $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. The expected lease residual value of our operating lease portfolio at scheduled termination was $7.2 billion and $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. For information on our valuation of automotive operating lease residuals including periodic revisions through adjustments to depreciation expense based on current and forecasted market conditions, refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates-Valuation of Automotive Operating Lease Assets and Residuals within this MD&A.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Priced residual value projections - At contract inception, we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle. This evaluation uses a proprietary model, which includes variables such as age, expected mileage, seasonality, segment factors, vehicle type, economic indicators, production cycle, automotive manufacturer incentives, and unanticipated shifts in used vehicle supply, as well as expert judgment. This internally generated data is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. Periodically, we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense over the remaining life of the contract as necessary. At termination, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Remarketing abilities - Our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and the proceeds realized from vehicle sales.

The decrease in average gain per vehicle for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to a decline in used vehicle values\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nresulting from increased market supply, most notably during the fourth quarter of 2019. The number of off-lease vehicles remarketed during the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased 16% compared to 2018. The decrease in remarketing volume for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to the wind down of our legacy GM operating lease portfolio. We expect future termination volume to be more consistent with trends experienced during the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information on our investment in operating leases, refer to Note 1 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating Lease Portfolio Mix\nWe monitor the concentration of our outstanding operating leases.

It is the risk resulting from the pursuit of business activities that turn out to be unsuccessful due to a variety of both controllable and non-controllable factors. We aim to mitigate this risk within our business lines through portfolio diversification, product innovations, close monitoring of the execution of our strategic and capital plan, and ensuring flexibility of the cost base.\nAlly's strategic plan is reviewed and approved annually by our Board, as are the capital plan and financial business plan. With oversight by our Board, executive management seeks to consistently apply core operating principles while executing our strategic plan within the risk appetite approved by the RC. The executive management team continuously monitors business performance throughout the year to assess strategic risk and find early warning signals so that risks can be proactively managed. Executive management regularly reviews actual performance versus the plan, updates our Board via reporting routines, and implements changes as deemed appropriate.\nSignificant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and recovery and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by our Board as required. At the business level, as we introduce new products, we monitor their performance relative to expectations. With oversight by our Board, executive management evaluates changes to the financial forecast and risk, capital, and liquidity positions throughout the year.\nReputation Risk\nReputation risk is the risk arising from negative public opinion on our business practices, whether true or not, that could cause a decline in the customer base, litigation, or revenue reductions. Reputation risk may result from many of our activities, including those related to the management of our business/strategic, operational, and credit risks. We manage reputation risk through established policies and controls in our businesses and risk-management processes to mitigate reputation risks in a timely manner and through proactive monitoring and identification of potential reputation risk events. We have established processes and procedures to respond to events that give rise to reputation risk, including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion, external communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and informing key stakeholders of potential reputation risks. Primary responsibility for the identification, escalation, and resolution of reputation risk issues resides with our business lines. Each employee has an obligation, within the scope of their activities, to analyze and assess any imminent or intended transaction in terms of possible risk factors in order to minimize reputation risks. Further, Ally's strong LEAD\u201d culture and distinct Do it Right\u201d philosophy also strengthen our efforts to mitigate reputational risks by promoting a transparent culture where every associate is expected to act as a risk manager. Our culture is proactive with our core principles embedded at all levels of the organization so that any associate, at any time, can and should call attention to risks that need to be addressed and taken into account. Our organization and governance structures provide oversight of reputation risks, and key risk indicators are reported regularly and directly to management and the RC, which provide primary oversight of reputation risk.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss or harm arising from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors, or external events. Operational risk is an inherent risk element in all of our activities. Such risk can manifest in various ways, including errors, business interruptions, and inappropriate behavior of employees, and can potentially result in financial losses and other damage to us. Operational risk includes business disruption risk, fraud risk, human capital risk, legal risk, model risk, process execution and management risk, and supplier (third party) risk.\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Business disruption risk - The risk of significant disruption to our operations resulting from natural disasters, external technology outages, or other external events.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fraud risk - The risk from deliberate misrepresentation or concealment of information material to a transaction with the intent to deceive another and that is reasonably relied on or used in decision making.

This includes a supplier's failure to comply with information technology requirements, information and physical security, laws, rules, regulations, and legal agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> To monitor and mitigate such risk, we maintain a system of policies and a control framework designed to provide a sound and well-controlled operational environment. This framework employs practices and tools designed to maintain risk identification, risk governance, risk and control assessment and testing, risk monitoring, and transparency through risk reporting mechanisms. The goal is to maintain operational risk at appropriate levels based on our financial strength, the characteristics of the businesses and the markets in which we operate, and the related competitive and regulatory environment.\nInformation Technology/Security Risk\nInformation technology/security risk includes risk resulting from the failure of, or insufficiency in, information technology (for example, a system outage) or intentional or accidental unauthorized access, sharing, removal, tampering, or disposal of company and customer data or records.\nWe and our service providers rely extensively on communications, data-management, and other operating systems and infrastructure to conduct our business and operations. Failures or disruptions to these systems or infrastructure from cyberattacks or other events may impede our ability to conduct business and operations and may result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, or other harm.\nWe and other financial institutions continue to be the target of various cyberattacks, including through the introduction of malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service, or other security breaches, as part of an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions or obtain confidential, proprietary, or other information or assets of the Company, our customers, employees, or other third parties with whom we transact.\nCybersecurity and the continued development of our controls, processes, and systems to protect our technology infrastructure, customer information, and other proprietary information or assets remain a critical and ongoing priority. We recognize that cyber-related risks continue to evolve and have become increasingly sophisticated, and as a result we continuously evaluate the adequacy of our preventive and detective measures.\nIn order to help mitigate cybersecurity risks, we devote substantial resources to protect the Company from cyber-related incidents. We regularly assess vulnerabilities and threats to our environment utilizing various resources including independent third-party assessments to evaluate whether our layered system of controls effectively mitigates risk. We also invest in new technologies and infrastructure in order to respond to evolving risks within our environment. We continue to partner with other industry peers in order to share knowledge and information to further our security environment and invest in training and employee awareness to cyber-related risks. Additionally, as a further protective measure, we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to terms and conditions, may cover certain aspects of cybersecurity and information risks; however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses. Management monitors operational metrics and data surrounding cybersecurity operations, and the organization monitors compliance with established limits in connection with our risk appetite. Senior leadership regularly reviews, questions, and challenges such information.\nThe RC reviews cybersecurity risks, incidents, and developments in connection with its oversight of our independent risk-management program. Our Board and the AC also undertake reviews as appropriate. The Information Technology Risk Committee is responsible for supporting the Chief Risk Officer's oversight of Ally's management of cybersecurity and other risks involving our communications, data-management, and other operating systems and infrastructure. Additionally, our cybersecurity program is regularly assessed by Audit Services, which reports directly to the AC. The business lines are also actively engaged in overseeing the service providers that supply or support the operating systems and infrastructure on which we depend and, with effective challenge from the independent risk-management function, managing related operational and other risks.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nNotwithstanding these risk and control initiatives, we may incur losses attributable to information technology/security risk from time to time, and there can be no assurance these losses will not be incurred in the future or will not be substantial. For further information on cybersecurity, technology, systems, and infrastructure, refer to the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we implemented a new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases that is utilized for customer servicing and financial reporting through the full lifecycle of these loans and leases. This new platform replaces our existing consumer automotive loan and lease technology platform and helps modernize our technology, enhance the flexibility and capabilities of the platform, and streamline aspects of our servicing operations. While this new platform will help us continue to expand our capabilities, there are inherent risks in implementing any new system such as this. We will continue to monitor the newly implemented platform to ensure the system is performing as expected.\nCompliance Risk\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to the banking organization (applicable rules and standards). Examples of such risks include compliance with regulations set forth by banking agencies including fair and responsible banking, anti-money laundering, or community reinvestment act, risks associated with offering our products or services, or risks associated with deviating from internal policies and procedures including those that are established to promote sound risk-management and internal-control practices. Compliance risk also includes fiduciary risk, which includes risks arising from our duty to exercise loyalty, act in the best interest of our clients, and care for assets according to an appropriate standard of care. This risk generally exists to the extent that we exercise discretion in managing assets on behalf of a customer.\nWe recognize that an effective compliance program, including driving a culture of compliance, plays a key role in managing and overseeing compliance risk, and that a proactive compliance environment and program are essential to help meet various legal, regulatory, or other requirements or expectations. To manage compliance risk, we maintain a system of policies, change-management protocols, control frameworks, and other formal governance structures designed to provide a holistic enterprise approach to managing such risks, which includes consideration of identifying, assessing, monitoring, and communicating compliance risks throughout the Company. Our compliance function provides independent, enterprise-wide oversight of compliance-risk exposures and related risk-management practices and is led by the Chief Compliance Officer who reports to our Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Compliance Officer has the authority and responsibility for the oversight and administration of our Enterprise Compliance Program, which includes ongoing reporting of significant compliance-related matters to our Board and various committees established to govern compliance-related risks. The Compliance Risk Management Committee, established by the Chief Compliance Officer, serves to facilitate compliance risk management and to oversee the implementation of Ally's compliance risk-management strategies and covers compliance matters across the enterprise including matters impacting customers, products, geographies, and services.\nConduct Risk\nConduct risk is the risk of customer harm, employee harm, reputational damage, regulatory sanction, or financial loss resulting from the behavior of our employees and contractors toward customers, counterparties, other employees and contractors, or the markets in which we operate.\nBusiness lines are responsible for driving a culture consistent with our LEAD\u201d core values and Do it Right\u201d philosophy (otherwise known as the Tone from the Top\u201d). Ally maintains an enterprise-wide Conduct Risk Management program that establishes the requirements, standards, and processes to manage conduct risk.\nWe manage conduct risk through a variety of enterprise programs, policies, and procedures. Associates complete required training at on-boarding, and annually thereafter, to affirm their compliance with our Code of Conduct and Ethics. Training programs and other resources set expectations surrounding appropriate conduct, and behavior, and a culture of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies, and standards. Officers and employees are expected to take personal responsibility for maintaining the highest standards of honesty, trustworthiness, and ethical behavior; to understand and manage the risks associated with their positions; and to escalate concerns about risk management (including reporting of potential violations of the Code of Conduct and Ethics, our policies, or other laws and regulations). Conduct risk is considered through various human resources and management activities including associate recruiting, on-boarding, performance management, incentive programs and compensation, and corrective action. Oversight of conduct risk is performed by Enterprise Risk Management.\nEmployee engagement surveys and risk culture surveys provide valuable insight into employee views and opinions about the company's culture and conduct. The Ethics Hotline (independently managed, available to associates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) and Open-Door Process provide avenues for employees to report concerns or incidents of potential misconduct. Human Resources, Employee Relations, and Enterprise Fraud, Security, and Investigations have established processes and procedures for investigating and addressing cases of potential fraud or employee misconduct.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nLiquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital\nOverview\nThe purpose of liquidity management is to enable us to meet loan and operating lease demand, debt maturities, deposit withdrawals, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions as well as periods of economic or financial stress. Our primary objective is to maintain cost-effective, stable and diverse sources of funding capable of sustaining the organization throughout all market cycles. Sources of funding include both retail and brokered deposits and secured and unsecured market-based funding across various maturity, interest rate, and investor profiles. Additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities, committed secured credit facilities, repurchase agreements, and advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh.\nWe define liquidity risk as the risk that an institution's financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions. Liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institution-specific or market-related events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization. Effective management of liquidity risk positions an organization to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events. Managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions.\nThe Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO), chaired by the Corporate Treasurer, is responsible for overseeing our funding and liquidity strategies. Corporate Treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within limits approved by ALCO and the RC. As part of managing liquidity risk, Corporate Treasury prepares periodic forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds, executes our funding strategies, and manages liquidity under normal as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments. Oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk are provided by Independent Risk Management.\nFunding Strategy\nLiquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and cost-effective access to retail deposits and funding in various segments of the capital markets. We focus on maintaining diversified funding sources across a broad base of depositors, lenders, and investors to meet liquidity needs throughout different economic cycles, including periods of financial distress. These funding sources include retail and brokered deposits, committed secured credit facilities, public and private asset-backed securitizations, unsecured debt, FHLB advances, whole-loan sales, demand notes, and repurchase agreements. Our access to diversified funding sources enhances funding flexibility and results in a more cost-effective funding strategy over the long term. We evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles.\nWe manage our funding to achieve a well-balanced portfolio across a spectrum of risk, maturity, and cost-of-funds characteristics. Optimizing funding at Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our long-term liquidity strategy. We optimize our funding sources at Ally Bank by growing retail deposits, maintaining active public and private securitization programs, managing a prudent maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio, utilizing repurchase agreements, and continuing to access funds from the FHLB.\nEssentially all asset originations are directed to Ally Bank to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements, and to utilize our growing consumer deposit-taking capabilities. This allows us to use bank funding for an increasing proportion of our automotive finance and other assets and to provide a sustainable long-term funding channel for the business, while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nMultiple metrics are used to measure liquidity risk, manage the liquidity position, identify related trends, and monitor such trends and metrics against established limits. These metrics include coverage ratios and comprehensive stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio over stressed horizons ranging from overnight to 12 months, stability ratios that measure longer-term structural liquidity, and concentration ratios that enable prudent funding diversification. In addition, we have established internal management routines designed to review all aspects of liquidity and funding plans, evaluate the adequacy of liquidity buffers, review stress testing results, and assist management in the execution of its funding strategy and risk-management accountabilities.\nDuring October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized revisions to its regulatory framework which tailor regulatory requirements based on a banking organization's asset size and other supplementary measures, as further discussed in the section titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item I, of this report. Those revisions exempt Ally from complying with the LCR and LCR Disclosure Requirements and Ally ceased publication of this disclosure effective December 31, 2019. We do not anticipate a material change to Ally's funding and liquidity position as a result of the changes to the LCR requirement.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOur liquidity stress testing is designed to allow us to operate our businesses and to meet our contractual and contingent obligations, including unsecured debt maturities, for at least 12 months, assuming our normal access to funding is disrupted by severe market-wide and enterprise-specific events. We maintain available liquidity in the form of cash, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and available committed secured credit facility capacity.

These retail deposits provide our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, Corporate Finance operations and Ally Lending with a stable and low-cost funding source. Retail deposits are a key driver of funding cost optimization and reducing reliance on capital markets-based funding. We believe retail deposits are less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility, or changes in credit ratings when compared to other funding sources. We have continued to expand our deposit gathering efforts through both direct and indirect marketing channels. Current retail deposit offerings consist of a variety of products including CDs, savings accounts, money-market accounts, IRA deposit products, as well as an interest checking product. In addition, we utilize brokered deposits, which are obtained through third-party intermediaries, including a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table shows Ally Bank's number of accounts and deposit balances as of the end of each quarter since 2018.\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>4th quarter 2019\n</td> <td>3rd quarter 2019\n</td> <td>2nd quarter 2019\n</td> <td>1st quarter 2019\n</td> <td>4th quarter 2018\n</td> <td>3rd quarter 2018\n</td> <td>2nd quarter 2018\n</td> <td>1st quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of retail bank accounts (in thousands)\n</td> <td>4,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokered (a)\n</td> <td>16,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (b)\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Brokered deposit balances include a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances deposited at Ally Bank by a third party of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2019, $1.1 billion as September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, and $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2018, June 30, 2018, and March 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Other deposits include mortgage escrow and other deposits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> During 2019, our total deposit base grew $14.6 billion and we added approximately 322 thousand retail deposit customers, resulting in 1.97 million total retail deposit customers as of December 31, 2019. The recent growth in total deposits has been primarily attributable to our retail deposit portfolio-particularly within our online savings product and retail CDs. Strong retention rates and customer acquisition, reflecting the strength of the brand, continue to drive growth in retail deposits. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of deposit funding by type.\nSecuritizations and Secured Financings\nIn addition to building a larger deposit base, securitizations and secured funding continue to be a reliable and cost-effective source of financing. Securitizations and secured funding transactions, collectively referred to as securitization transactions due to their similarities, allow us to convert our automotive finance receivables and operating leases into cash earlier than what would have occurred in the normal course of business, and we continue to remain active in the well-established securitization markets.\nAs part of these securitization transactions, we sell assets to various special purpose entities (SPEs) in exchange for the proceeds from the issuance of debt and other beneficial interests in the assets. The activities of the SPEs are generally limited to acquiring the assets, issuing and making payments on the debt, paying related expenses, and periodically reporting to investors.\nThese SPEs are separate legal entities that assume the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables they hold. The assets of the SPEs are not available to satisfy our claims or those of our creditors. In addition, the SPEs do not invest in our equity or in the equity of any of our affiliates. Our economic exposure related to the SPEs is generally limited to cash reserves, retained interests, and customary representation, warranty, and covenant provisions.\nWe typically agree to service the assets transferred in our securitization transactions for a fee, and we may be entitled to other related fees. The total amount of servicing fees earned is disclosed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We may also retain a portion of senior and subordinated interests issued by the SPEs. Subordinate interests typically provide credit support to the more highly rated senior interest in a securitization transaction and may be subject to all or a portion of the first-loss position related to the sold assets.\nCertain of these securitization transactions meet the criteria to be accounted for as off-balance-sheet securitization transactions if we do not hold a potentially significant economic interest or do not provide servicing or asset management functions for the financial assets held by the securitization entity. Certain of our securitization transactions do not meet the required criteria to be accounted for as off-balance-sheet securitization transactions; therefore, they are accounted for as secured borrowings. For information regarding our securitization activities, refer to Note 1 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2019, we raised $3.6 billion through the completion of term securitization transactions backed by consumer automotive loans. Additionally, for consumer automotive loans and operating leases, the term structure of the transaction locks in funding for a specified pool of loans and operating leases, creating an effective tool for managing interest rate and liquidity risk.\nWe manage securitization execution risk by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and available capacity from committed secured credit facilities provided by banks. Our ability to access the unused capacity in these facilities depends on the availability of eligible assets to collateralize the incremental funding and, in some instances, on the execution of interest rate hedges. We maintain bilateral facilities, which fund our Automotive Finance operations. The facilities can be revolving in nature-generally having an original tenor ranging from 364 days to two years and allowing for additional funding during the commitment period-or they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the commitment period. At December 31, 2019, all of our $2.5 billion of capacity was revolving and of this balance, $1.1 billion was from facilities with a remaining tenor greater than 364 days.\nWe also have access to funding through advances with the FHLB. These advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and investment securities. As of December 31, 2019, we had pledged $24.8 billion of assets to the FHLB resulting in $18.8 billion in total funding capacity with $16.3 billion of debt outstanding.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAt December 31, 2019, $46.2 billion of our total assets were restricted as collateral for the payment of debt obligations accounted for as secured borrowings and repurchase agreements. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nUnsecured Financings\nWe obtain unsecured funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes under our Demand Notes program. The holder has the option to require us to redeem these notes at any time without restriction. Demand Notes outstanding were $2.6 billion at December 31, 2019. We also have short-term and long-term unsecured debt outstanding from retail term note programs. These programs are composed of callable fixed-rate instruments with fixed-maturity dates and floating-rate notes. There were $271 million of retail term notes outstanding at December 31, 2019. The remainder of our unsecured debt is composed of institutional term debt. In May 2019, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised $750 million through the issuance of senior notes. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term unsecured debt.\nOther Secured and Unsecured Short-term Borrowings\nWe have access to repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. The securities sold in repurchase agreements include U.S. government and federal agency obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we had no debt outstanding under repurchase agreements.\nAdditionally, we have access to the FRB Discount Window and can borrow funds to meet short-term liquidity demands. However, the FRB is not a primary source of funding for day-to-day business. Instead, it is a liquidity source that can be accessed in stressed environments or periods of market disruption. We had assets pledged and restricted as collateral to the FRB totaling $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. We had no debt outstanding with the FRB as of December 31, 2019.\nCash Flows\nThe following summarizes the activity reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While this information may be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may not be as helpful when analyzing changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity, dividends, and ALM herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and related activity.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Activity was largely consistent year-over-year, as cash flows from our consumer and commercial lending activities remained relatively flat.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $14.5 billion for the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $9.7 billion net decrease in cash outflows from purchases, sales, originations and repayments of finance receivables and loans, as repayments outpaced originations. This decrease was also driven by a $835 million increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities, net proceeds from sales and repayments. This was partially offset by a $778 million increase in net outflows from purchases of operating lease assets, net of disposals.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $1.5 billion, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $10.7 billion for the same period in 2018. The change was primarily attributable to a $11.5 billion decrease in net cash inflows due to issuance of long-term debt and an increase in net cash outflows related to short-term borrowings of $3.0 billion between the two periods. This was partially offset by an increase of $1.7 billion from net cash inflows associated with deposits.\nCapital Planning and Stress Tests\nUnder the final rules implementing the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act), as further described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are (1) made subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle rather than the previously required one-year cycle, (2) required to continue submitting an annual capital plan to the FRB, (3) allowed to continue excluding accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital, (4) exempted from company-run capital stress testing, and (5) allowed to remain exempted from the supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer.\nOur annual capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on our capital. The plan must also include a discussion of how we, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with its risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, and will serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to the plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection. If the FRB objects to the plan, or if certain material events occur after submission of the plan, we must submit a revised plan to the FRB within 30 days. Even if the FRB does not object to the plan, we may be precluded from or limited in paying dividends or other capital distributions without the FRB's approval under certain circumstances-for example, when we would not meet minimum regulatory capital ratios and capital buffers after giving effect to the distributions.\nIn October 2019, the FRB noted its intent to propose changes to the capital-plan rule, including for the purpose of providing Category IV firms like us with additional flexibility in developing their annual capital plans. At this time, the impacts that such a potential future proposal may have on us are not clear.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents information related to our common stock and distributions to our common stockholders over the last eight quarters.\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Common stock repurchased during period (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash dividends declared per common share (b)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions, except per share data; shares in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Approximate dollar value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>End of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>437,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>425,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>425,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>399,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>399,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Includes shares of common stock withheld to cover income taxes owed by participants in our share-based incentive plans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>On January 13, 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share on all common stock, payable on February 14, 2020.

We were not required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB, participate in the supervisory stress test or CCAR, or conduct company-run capital stress tests during the 2019 cycle. Instead, our capital actions during this cycle are largely based on the results from our 2018 supervisory stress test. On April 1, 2019, our Board authorized an increase in our stock-repurchase program, permitting us to repurchase up to $1.25 billion of our common stock from time to time from the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020, representing a 25% increase over our previously announced program. Additionally, on January 13, 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our common stock. Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the most recent dividend.\nOur ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, will continue to be subject to the FRB's review and internal governance requirements, including approval by our Board. The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases also will be subject to various factors, including Ally's capital and liquidity positions, regulatory considerations, any accounting standards that affect capital or liquidity (including CECL), financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, common-stock price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time.\nRegulatory Capital\nRefer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section titled Selected Financial Data within this MD&A.\nCredit Ratings\nThe cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by credit ratings, which are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation. Lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. This is particularly true for certain institutional investors whose investment guidelines require investment-grade ratings on term debt and the two highest rating categories for short-term debt (particularly money-market investors).\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nNationally recognized statistical rating organizations rate substantially all our debt.

Following our announcement to acquire CardWorks on February 18, 2020, Fitch, Moody's, S&P, and DBRS affirmed our credit ratings for our short-term and senior unsecured debt, with each agency maintaining its respective outlook.\nRating agencies indicate that they base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, which may include capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current operating, legislative, and regulatory environment. Rating agencies themselves could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices-particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes. Potential changes in rating methodology, as well as in the legislative and regulatory environment, and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nA credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nInsurance Financial Strength Ratings\nSubstantially all of our Insurance operations have a Financial Strength Rating (FSR) and an Issuer Credit Rating (ICR) from the A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best). The FSR is intended to be an indicator of the ability of the insurance company to meet its senior most obligations to policyholders. Lower ratings generally result in fewer opportunities to write business, as insureds, particularly large commercial insureds, and insurance companies purchasing reinsurance have guidelines requiring high FSR ratings. On August 30, 2019, A.M. Best upgraded the FSR for Ally Insurance Group to A- (excellent) from B++ (good), and upgraded the ICR to a- from bbb+. The outlook was revised to Stable from Positive.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nRefer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGuarantees\nGuarantees are defined as contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to third parties based on changes in an underlying agreement that is related to a guaranteed party. Our guarantees include client securities to a clearing broker, standby letters of credit, and certain contract provisions associated with securitizations, sales, and divestitures.

While payments due on insurance losses are considered contractual obligations because they related to insurance policies issued by us, the ultimate amount to be paid and the timing of payment for an insurance loss is an estimate subject to significant uncertainty. Furthermore, the majority of the balance is expected to be paid out in less than five years.\nThe following provides a description of the items summarized in the preceding table of contractual obligations.\nLong-term Debt\nAmounts represent the scheduled maturity of long-term debt at December 31, 2019, assuming that no early redemptions occur. The maturity of secured debt may vary based on the payment activity of the related secured assets. The amounts presented are before the effect of any unamortized discount, debt issuance costs, or fair value adjustment. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt obligations. We primarily use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our secured and unsecured long-term debt portfolio. These derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. For additional information on derivatives, refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLease Commitments\nWe have obligations under various operating lease arrangements for real property with noncancelable lease terms that expire after December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nPurchase Obligations\nWe enter into multiple contractual arrangements for various services. The arrangements represent fixed payment obligations under our most significant contracts and primarily relate to contracts with information technology providers. Refer to Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nBank Certificates of Deposit\nRefer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nLending Commitments\nWe have outstanding lending commitments with customers. The amounts presented represent the unused portion of those commitments at December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nAccounting policies are integral to understanding our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions, on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; critical accounting estimates are described in this section. An accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to these estimates.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses (the allowance) to absorb probable loan credit losses inherent in the held-for-investment portfolio. The allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience in our lending portfolio. The allowance is management's estimate of incurred losses in our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment. Management performs quarterly analyses of these portfolios to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses. Additions to the allowance are charged to current period earnings through the provision for loan losses; amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance, while amounts recovered on previously charged-off accounts increase the allowance. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance requires management to exercise significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, including the timing, frequency, and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for loan losses and, therefore, net income. For additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes, refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While we attribute portions of the allowance across our lending portfolios, the entire allowance is available to absorb probable loan losses inherent in our total lending portfolio.\nThe consumer portfolio segments consist of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans within our Automotive Finance operations, Mortgage Finance operations, and consumer unsecured lending included within Corporate and Other. Excluding certain loans that are identified as individually impaired, the allowance for each consumer portfolio segment (automotive, mortgage, and other) is evaluated collectively. The allowance is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations that begin with estimates of incurred losses in each portfolio segment based on various statistical analyses for our automotive and mortgage portfolio segments, and a vintage analysis for our other portfolio segment. We leverage statistical models based on recent loss trends to develop a systematic incurred loss reserve. These statistical loss forecasting models are utilized to estimate incurred losses and consider several credit quality indicators including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, current economic conditions, credit scores, and expected loss factors by loan type. Management believes these factors are relevant to estimate incurred losses and are updated on a quarterly basis in order to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment, as changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact. In order to develop our best estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio, management reviews and analyzes the output from the models and may adjust the reserves to take into consideration environmental, qualitative, and other factors that may not be captured in the models. These adjustments are documented and reviewed through our risk management processes. Management reviews, updates, and validates its systematic process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis. This process involves an analysis of loss information, such as a review of loss and credit trends, a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts, and other analyses.\nThe commercial portfolio segment is primarily composed of larger-balance, nonhomogeneous exposures within our Automotive Finance operations and Corporate Finance operations. These loans are primarily evaluated individually and are risk-rated based on borrower, collateral, and industry-specific information that management believes is relevant in determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement based on current information and events. Management establishes specific allowances for commercial loans determined to be individually impaired based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loans' effective interest rate, and the observable market price or the fair value of collateral, whichever is determined to be the most appropriate. Estimated costs to sell the collateral on a discounted basis are included in the impairment measurement, when appropriate. In addition to the specific allowances for impaired loans, loans that are not identified as individually impaired are grouped into pools based on similar risk characteristics and collectively evaluated. These allowances are based on historical loss experience, concentrations, current economic conditions, performance trends within specific geographic locations, and other qualitative factors identified by management. The commercial historical loss experience is updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflective of the current economic environment.\nThe determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and many factors that may materially affect estimates of loss, including volatility of loss given default, probability of default, and rating migration. The critical assumptions underlying the allowance include: (i) segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics; (ii) identification and estimation of portfolio indicators and other factors that management believes are key to estimating incurred credit losses; and (iii) evaluation by management of borrower, collateral, and geographic information. Management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments as the assumptions in the\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nunderlying analyses change to reflect an estimate of incurred loan losses at the reporting date, based on the best information available at that time. In addition, the allowance related to the commercial portfolio segment could be influenced by situations in which automotive manufacturers may repurchase vehicles used as collateral to secure the loans in default situations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce earnings.\nValuation of Automotive Operating Lease Assets and Residuals\nWe have significant investments in vehicles in our operating lease portfolio. In accounting for operating leases, management must make a determination at the beginning of the operating lease contract of the estimated realizable value (i.e., residual value) of the vehicle at the end of the lease. Residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term. At contract inception, we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the vehicle. This evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model, which includes variables such as age, expected mileage, seasonality, segment factors, vehicle type, economic indicators, production cycle, automotive manufacturer incentives, and shifts in used vehicle supply. This internally generated data is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. The customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus rental charges. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception. Management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of operating lease assets.\nTo account for residual risk, we depreciate automotive operating lease assets to expected realizable value on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The estimated realizable value is initially based on the residual value established at contract inception. Periodically, we review the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions, and other relevant data points, and adjust depreciation expense as necessary over the remaining term of the lease. Impairment of operating lease assets is assessed upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Triggering events are systemic, observed events impacting the used vehicle market such as shocks to oil and gas prices that may indicate impairment of the operating lease asset. Impairment is determined to exist if the expected undiscounted cash flows generated from the operating lease assets are less than the carrying value of the operating lease assets. If the operating lease assets are impaired, they are written down to their fair value as estimated by discounted cash flows. There were no such impairment charges in 2019, 2018, or 2017.\nOur depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers management's expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination, which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values. The critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automotive operating lease assets include: (i) estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values, (ii) proper identification and estimation of business conditions, (iii) our remarketing abilities, and (iv) automotive manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the operating lease residual value. Expected residual values include estimates of payments from automotive manufacturers related to residual support and risk-sharing agreements, if any. To the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements, our depreciation expense would be negatively impacted.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Refer to Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models, and significant assumptions utilized. We follow the fair value hierarchy set forth in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in order to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value. We review and modify, as necessary, our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis, which can result in reclassifications between hierarchy levels.\nWe have numerous internal controls in place to address risks inherent in estimating fair value measurements. Significant fair value measurements are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval. We have an established risk management policy and model validation program. This model validation program establishes a controlled environment for the development, implementation, and operation of models used to generate fair value measurements and change procedures. Further, this program uses a risk-based approach to determine the frequency at which models are to be independently reviewed and validated. Additionally, a wide array of operational controls governs fair value measurements, including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurement models. For example, we backtest the internal assumptions used within models against actual performance. We also monitor the market for recent trades, market surveys, or other market information that may be used to benchmark model inputs or outputs. Certain valuations will also be benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available. We have scheduled model or input recalibrations that occur on a periodic basis but will recalibrate earlier if significant variances are observed as part of the backtesting or benchmarking noted above.\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions from market observable data used to estimate our Level 2 fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to our internal valuation models used to estimate our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayment speeds, credit losses, and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements and amounts that could be realized.\nDetermination of Provision for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes predominantly in the United States. Significant\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\njudgments and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss).\nAs of each reporting date, we consider existing evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. Following the sale of our legacy international operations in 2012 and 2013, we continue to hold unexpired foreign tax credits subject to a partial valuation allowance. We continue to believe it is more likely than not that the benefit for certain foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we continue to provide a partial valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets relating to these carryforwards and it is reasonably possible that the valuation allowance may change in the next 12 months.\nFor additional information regarding our provision for income taxes, refer to Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards.\nManagement's Discussion and

(together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, Ally, the Company, or we, us, or our) is a leading digital financial-services company. As a customer-centric company with passionate customer service and innovative financial solutions, we are relentlessly focused on Doing It Right\u201d and being a trusted financial-services provider to our consumer, commercial, and corporate customers. We are one of the largest full-service automotive finance operations in the country and offer a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and consumers. Our award-winning online bank (Ally Bank, Member FDIC and Equal Housing Lender) offers mortgage lending, personal lending, and a variety of deposit and other banking products, including savings, money-market, and checking accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Additionally, we offer\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nsecurities-brokerage and investment-advisory services through Ally Invest. Our robust corporate-finance business offers capital for equity sponsors and middle-market companies. We are a Delaware corporation and are registered as a bank holding company (BHC) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and a financial holding company (FHC) under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended.\nOur Business\nDealer Financial Services\nDealer Financial Services comprises our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments. Our primary customers are automotive dealers, which are independently owned businesses. A dealer may sell or lease a vehicle for cash but, more typically, enters into a retail installment sales contract or operating lease with the customer and then sells the retail installment sales contract or the operating lease and the leased vehicle, as applicable, to Ally or another automotive-finance provider. The purchase by Ally or another provider is commonly described as indirect automotive lending to the customer.\nOur Dealer Financial Services business is one of the largest full-service automotive finance operations in the country and offers a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and their customers. We have deep dealer relationships that have been built throughout our over 100-year history, and we are leveraging competitive strengths to expand our dealer footprint. Our dealer-centric business model encourages dealers to use our broad range of products through incentive programs like our Ally Dealer Rewards program, which rewards individual dealers based on the depth and breadth of our relationship. Our automotive finance services include purchasing retail installment sales contracts and operating leases from dealers, extending automotive loans directly to consumers, offering term loans to dealers, financing dealer floorplans and providing other lines of credit to dealers, supplying warehouse lines to automotive retailers, offering automotive-fleet financing, providing financing to companies and municipalities for the purchase or lease of vehicles, and supplying vehicle-remarketing services. We also offer retail VSCs and commercial insurance primarily covering dealers' vehicle inventories. We are a leading provider of VSCs, GAP, and vehicle maintenance contracts (VMCs).\nAutomotive Finance\nOur Automotive Finance operations provide U.S.-based automotive financing services to consumers, automotive dealers, other businesses, and municipalities. Our dealer-focused business model, value-added products and services, full-spectrum financing, and business expertise proven over many credit cycles make us a premier automotive finance company. At December 31, 2019, our Automotive Finance operations had $113.9 billion of assets and generated $4.4 billion of total net revenue in 2019. For consumers, we provide financing for new and used vehicles. In addition, our Commercial Services Group (CSG) provides automotive financing for small businesses. At December 31, 2019, our CSG had $8.2 billion of loans outstanding. Through our commercial automotive financing operations, we fund dealer purchases of new and used vehicles through wholesale floorplan financing. We manage commercial account servicing on approximately 3,300 dealers that utilize our floorplan inventory lending or other commercial loans. We service an $80.6 billion consumer loan and operating lease portfolio at December 31, 2019, and our commercial automotive loan portfolio was approximately $32.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The extensive infrastructure, technology, and analytics of our servicing operations as well as the experience of our servicing personnel enhance our ability to minimize our loan losses and enable us to deliver a favorable customer experience to both our dealers and retail customers. During 2019, we continued to reposition our origination profile to focus on capital optimization and risk-adjusted returns. In 2019, total consumer automotive originations were $36.3 billion, an increase of $898 million compared to 2018. The shorter-term duration consumer automotive loan and variable-rate commercial loan portfolios offer attractive asset classes where we continue to optimize risk-adjusted returns through origination mix management and pricing and underwriting discipline.\nOur success as an automotive finance provider is driven by the consistent and broad range of products and services we offer to dealers. The automotive marketplace is dynamic and evolving, and we are focused on meeting the needs of both our dealer and consumer customers and continuing to strengthen and expand upon the 18,300 dealer relationships we have. Clearlane, our online automotive lender exchange, expands our direct-to-consumer capabilities and provides a digital platform for consumers seeking financing. Clearlane further enhances our automotive financing offerings, dealer relationships, and digital capabilities. In addition to providing a digital direct-to-consumer channel for Ally, Clearlane is a fee-based business that generates revenue by successfully referring leads to other automotive lenders. Additionally, we continue to identify and cultivate relationships with automotive retailers including those with leading eCommerce platforms. We believe these actions will enable us to respond to the growing trends for a more streamlined and digital automotive financing process to serve both dealers and consumers.\nThe Growth channel was established to focus on developing dealer relationships beyond those relationships that primarily were developed through our role as a captive finance company for General Motors Company (GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC (Chrysler). The Growth channel was expanded to include direct-to-consumer financing through Clearlane and other channels and our arrangements with online automotive retailers. We have established relationships with thousands of Growth channel dealers through our customer-centric approach and specialized incentive programs designed to drive loyalty amongst dealers to our products and services. The success of the Growth channel has been a key enabler to converting our business model from a focused captive finance company to a leading market competitor. In this channel, we currently have over 11,800 dealer relationships, of which approximately 88% are franchised dealers (including brands such as Ford, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda, and others), or used vehicle only retailers with a national presence.\nOver the past several years, we have continued to focus on the consumer used vehicle segment primarily through franchised dealers, which has resulted in used vehicle financing volume growth, and has positioned us as an industry leader in used vehicle financing. The highly fragmented used vehicle financing market, with a total financing opportunity represented by over 279 million vehicles in operation, provides\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nan attractive opportunity that we believe will further expand and support our dealer relationships and increase our risk-adjusted return on retail loan originations.\nFor consumers, we provide automotive loan financing and leasing for new and used vehicles to approximately 4.5 million customers. Retail financing for the purchase of vehicles by individual consumers generally takes the form of installment sales financing. We originated a total of approximately 1.4 million automotive loans and operating leases during both the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, totaling $36.3 billion and $35.4 billion, respectively.\nOur consumer automotive financing operations generate revenue primarily through finance charges on retail installment sales contracts and rental payments on operating lease contracts. For operating leases, when the contract is originated, we estimate the residual value of the leased vehicle at lease termination. Periodically thereafter we revise the projected residual value of the leased vehicle at lease termination and adjust depreciation expense over the remaining life of the lease if appropriate. Given the fluctuations in used vehicle values, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the projected residual value, which results in gains or losses on lease termination. While all operating leases are exposed to potential reductions in used vehicle values, only loans where we take possession of the vehicle are affected by potential reductions in used vehicle values. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion of credit risk and lease residual risk.\nWe continue to maintain a diverse mix of product offerings across a broad risk spectrum, subject to underwriting policies that reflect our risk appetite. Our current operating results continue to increasingly reflect our ongoing strategy to grow used vehicle financing and expand risk-adjusted returns. While we predominately focus on prime-lending markets, we seek to be a meaningful source of financing to a wide spectrum of customers and continue to carefully measure risk versus return. We place great emphasis on our risk management and risk-based pricing policies and practices and employ robust credit decisioning processes coupled with granular pricing that is differentiated across our proprietary credit tiers.\nOur commercial automotive financing operations primarily fund dealer inventory purchases of new and used vehicles, commonly referred to as wholesale floorplan financing. This represents the largest portion of our commercial automotive financing business. Wholesale floorplan loans are secured by vehicles financed (and all other vehicle inventory), which provide strong collateral protection in the event of dealership default. Additional collateral or other credit enhancements (for example, personal guarantees from dealership owners) are typically obtained to further mitigate credit risk. The amount we advance to dealers is equal to 100% of the wholesale invoice price of new vehicles. Interest on wholesale automotive financing is generally payable monthly and is indexed to a floating-rate benchmark. The rate for a particular dealer is based on, among other considerations, competitive factors and the dealer's creditworthiness. During 2019, we financed an average of $28.2 billion of dealer vehicle inventory through wholesale floorplan financings. Other commercial automotive lending products, which averaged $5.7 billion during 2019, consist of automotive dealer revolving lines of credit, term loans, including those to finance dealership land and buildings, and dealer fleet financing. We also provide comprehensive automotive remarketing services, including the use of SmartAuction, our online auction platform, which efficiently supports dealer-to-dealer and other commercial wholesale vehicle transactions. SmartAuction provides diversified fee-based revenue and serves as a means of deepening relationships with our dealership customers. In 2019, Ally and other parties, including dealers, fleet rental companies, and financial institutions, utilized SmartAuction to sell approximately 270,000 vehicles to dealers and other commercial customers. SmartAuction served as the remarketing channel for 53% of our off-lease vehicles.\nInsurance\nOur Insurance operations offer both consumer finance protection and insurance products sold primarily through the automotive dealer channel, and commercial insurance products sold directly to dealers. We serve approximately 2.4 million consumers nationwide across Finance and Insurance (F&I) and Property and Casualty (P&C) products. In addition, we offer F&I products in Canada, where we serve approximately 445 thousand consumers and are the VSC and protection plan provider for GM Canada. Our Insurance operations had $8.5 billion of assets at December 31, 2019, and generated $1.3 billion of total net revenue during 2019. As part of our focus on offering dealers a broad range of consumer financial and insurance products, we offer VSCs, VMCs, and GAP products. We also underwrite selected commercial insurance coverages, which primarily insure dealers' wholesale vehicle inventory. Ally Premier Protection is our flagship VSC offering, which provides coverage for new and used vehicles of virtually all makes and models. We also offer ClearGuard on the SmartAuction platform, which is a protection product designed to minimize the risk to dealers from arbitration claims for eligible vehicles sold at auction.\nFrom a dealer perspective, Ally provides significant value and expertise, which creates high retention rates and strong relationships. In addition to our product offerings, we provide consultative services and training to assist dealers in optimizing F&I results while achieving high levels of customer satisfaction and regulatory compliance. We also advise dealers regarding necessary liability and physical damage coverages.\nOur F&I products are primarily distributed indirectly through the automotive dealer network. We have established approximately 1,800 F&I dealer relationships nationwide and 600 dealer relationships in Canada, with a focus on growing dealer relationships in the future. Our VSCs for retail customers offer owners and lessees mechanical repair protection and roadside assistance for new and used vehicles beyond the manufacturer's new vehicle warranty. These VSCs are marketed to the public through automotive dealerships and on a direct response basis. We also offer GAP products, which allow the recovery of a specified amount beyond the covered vehicle's value in the event the vehicle is damaged or stolen and declared a total loss. We continue to evolve our product suite and digital capabilities to position our business for future opportunities through growing third-party relationships and sales through our online automotive lending exchange, Clearlane.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nWe have approximately 3,400 dealer relationships within our P&C business to whom we offer a variety of commercial products and levels of coverage. Vehicle inventory insurance for dealers provides physical damage protection for dealers' floorplan vehicles. Among dealers to whom we provide wholesale financing, our insurance product penetration rate is approximately 77%. Dealers who receive wholesale financing from us are eligible for insurance incentives such as automatic eligibility for our preferred insurance programs. In April 2019, we renewed our annual reinsurance agreement to obtain excess of loss coverage for our vehicle inventory insurance product to manage our risk of weather-related loss.\nA significant aspect of our Insurance operations is the investment of proceeds from premiums and other revenue sources. We use these investments to satisfy our obligations related to future claims at the time these claims are settled. Our Insurance operations have an Investment Committee, which develops guidelines and strategies for these investments. The guidelines established by this committee reflect our risk appetite, liquidity requirements, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors.\nMortgage Finance\nOur Mortgage Finance operations consist of the management of held-for-investment and held-for-sale consumer mortgage loan portfolios. Our held-for-investment portfolio includes bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and low-to-moderate income (LMI) mortgage loans originated by third parties, and our direct-to-consumer Ally Home mortgage offering. Our Mortgage Finance operations had $16.3 billion of assets at December 31, 2019, and generated $193 million of total net revenue in 2019.\nThrough the bulk loan channel, we purchase loans from several qualified sellers including direct originators and large aggregators who have the financial capacity to support strong representations and warranties and the industry knowledge and experience to originate high-quality assets. Bulk purchases are made on a servicing-released basis, allowing us to directly oversee servicing activities and manage prepayments through retention modification or refinancing through our direct-to-consumer channel. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased $3.5 billion of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties. Our mortgage loan purchases are held-for-investment.\nThrough our direct-to-consumer channel, which was introduced late in 2016, we offer a variety of competitively priced jumbo and conforming fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage products through a third-party fulfillment provider. Under our current arrangement, our direct-to-consumer conforming mortgages are originated as held-for-sale and sold, while jumbo and LMI mortgages are originated as held-for-investment. Loans originated in the direct-to-consumer channel are sourced by existing Ally customer marketing, prospect marketing on third-party websites, and email or direct mail campaigns. In April of 2019, we announced a strategic partnership with Better.com, which delivers an enhanced end-to-end digital mortgage experience for our customers through our direct-to-consumer channel. Through this partnership, Better.com conducts the sales, processing, underwriting, and closing for Ally's digital mortgage offerings in a highly innovative, scalable, and cost-efficient manner, while Ally retains control of all the marketing and advertising strategies and loan pricing. Ally and Better.com launched in 39 states since partnership inception. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we originated $2.7 billion of mortgage loans through our direct-to-consumer channel.\nThe combination of our bulk portfolio purchase program and our direct-to-consumer strategy provides the capacity to expand revenue sources and further grow and diversify our finance receivable portfolio with an attractive asset class while also deepening relationships with existing Ally customers.\nCorporate Finance\nOur Corporate Finance operations primarily provides senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle-market companies owned by private equity sponsors, and loans to asset managers that primarily provide leveraged loans. Our Corporate Finance operations had $5.8 billion of assets at December 31, 2019, and generated $284 million of total net revenue during 2019, and continues to offer attractive returns and diversification benefits to our broader lending portfolio. We believe our growing deposit-based funding model coupled with our expanded product offerings and deep industry relationships provide an advantage over our competition, which includes other banks as well as publicly and privately held finance companies. While there has been an increase in liquidity and competition in the middle-market lending space given a strong economic environment and favorable returns in this area, we have continued to prudently grow our lending portfolio with a focus on a disciplined and selective approach to credit quality, including a greater focus on asset-based loans. We seek markets and opportunities where our clients require customized, complex, and time-sensitive financing solutions. Our corporate finance lending portfolio is generally composed of first-lien, first-out loans.\nOur primary focus is on businesses owned by private equity sponsors with loans typically used for leveraged buyouts, mergers and acquisitions, debt refinancing, expansions, restructurings, and working capital. Additionally, our Lender Finance business provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct-lending activities. Our target commitment hold level for individual exposures ranges from $25 million to $150 million for individual borrowers, depending on product type. We also selectively arrange larger transactions that we may retain on-balance sheet or syndicate to other lenders. By syndicating loans to other lenders, we are able to provide financing commitments in excess of our target hold levels to our customers and generate loan syndication fee income while limiting our risk exposure to individual borrowers. Loan facilities typically include both a revolver and term loan component. All of our loans are floating-rate facilities with maturities, typically ranging from two to seven years. In certain instances, we may be offered the opportunity to make small equity investments in our borrowers, where we could benefit from potential appreciation in the company's value. The portfolio is well diversified across multiple industries including manufacturing, distribution, services, and other specialty sectors. These specialty sectors include our Technology Finance and Healthcare verticals. Our Technology Finance vertical provides financing solutions to venture capital-backed, technology-based companies. The Healthcare vertical provides financing across the healthcare spectrum including services, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and medical devices and supplies. We also provide a commercial real estate product focused on lending to skilled nursing\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nfacilities, senior housing, medical office buildings, and hospitals. Other smaller complementary product offerings that help strengthen our reputation as a full-spectrum provider of financing solutions for borrowers include selectively offering second-out loans on certain transactions and issuing letters of credit through Ally Bank.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other primarily consists of centralized corporate treasury activities such as management of the cash and corporate investment securities and loan portfolios, short- and long-term debt, retail and brokered deposit liabilities, derivative instruments, original issue discount, and the residual impacts of our corporate funds-transfer pricing (FTP) and treasury asset liability management (ALM) activities. Corporate and Other also includes activity related to certain equity investments, which primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and FRB stock, the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio, which primarily consists of loans originated prior to January 1, 2009, and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments.\nCorporate and Other also includes the results of Ally Invest, our digital brokerage and wealth management offering, which enables us to complement our competitive deposit products with low-cost investing. The digital wealth management business aligns with our strategy to create a premier digital financial services company and provides additional sources of fee income through asset management and certain other fees, with minimal balance sheet utilization. This business also provides an additional source of low-cost brokered deposits through arrangements with Ally Invest's clearing broker.\nThrough Ally Invest, we are able to offer a broader array of products through a fully integrated digital consumer platform centered around self-directed products and digital advisory services. Ally Invest's suite of commission-free and low-cost investing options serve both active and passive investors with diverse and evolving financial objectives through a transparent online process. Our digital platform and broad product offerings are enhanced by outstanding client-focused and user-friendly customer service that is accessible twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, via the phone, web or email-consistent with the Ally brand.\nAlly Invest provides clients with self-directed trading services for a variety of securities including stocks, options, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and fixed-income products through Ally Invest Securities. Ally Invest Securities also offers margin lending, which allows customers to borrow money by using securities and cash currently held in their accounts as collateral. Through Ally Invest Forex, we offer self-directed investors and traders the ability to trade over 50 currency pairs through a state-of-the-art forex trading platform.\nAlly Invest also provides digital advisory services to clients through web-based solutions, informational resources, and virtual interaction through Ally Invest Advisors, an SEC-registered investment advisor. These services have emerged as a fast-growing segment within the financial services industry over the past several years. Ally Invest Advisors provides clients the opportunity to obtain professional portfolio management services in return for a fee based upon the client's assets under management. We also offer cash enhanced portfolios that incur no management fee. A number of core managed portfolios are offered, which hold ETFs diversified across asset class, industry sector, and geography and which are customized for clients based on risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and wealth ratio.\nAdditionally, beginning in October 2019 with the acquisition of Health Credit Services, financial information related to our point-of-sale consumer unsecured financing is included within Corporate and Other. The Health Credit Services business has been renamed Ally Lending and currently serves medical service providers by enabling promotional and fixed rate installment-loan products through a fully digital application process that offers direct integration with health care provider systems. This platform includes providing underwriting, financing application and loan processing, servicing and collections. While we currently focus on healthcare-related lending, we believe the market outlook for point-of-sale lending provides attractive opportunities for future diversification. Point-of-sale lending broadens our capabilities, expands our product offering into consumer unsecured lending, all while helping to further meet financial needs of our customers. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the acquisition of Health Credit Services.\nThe net financing revenue and other interest income of our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance operations include the results of an FTP process that insulates these operations from interest rate volatility by matching assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. The FTP process assigns charge rates to the assets and credit rates to the liabilities within our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance operations, based on anticipated maturity and a benchmark rate curve plus an assumed credit spread. The assumed credit spread represents the cost of funds for each asset class based on a blend of funding channels available to the enterprise, including unsecured and secured capital markets, private funding facilities, and deposits. In addition, a risk-based methodology is used to allocate equity to these operations.\nDeposits\nWe are focused on growing a stable deposit base and deepening relationships with our nearly 2.0 million primary deposit customers by leveraging our compelling brand and strong value proposition. Ally Bank is a direct bank with no branch network that obtains retail deposits directly from customers through internet, telephone, mobile, and mail channels. We have grown our deposits with a strong brand that is based on a promise of being straightforward with our customers and offering high-quality customer service. Ally Bank has consistently increased its share of the direct banking deposit market and remains one of the largest direct banks in terms of retail deposit balances. Our strong retention rates and a growing customer base reflect the strength of our brand and, together with competitive deposit rates, continue to drive growth in retail deposits. At December 31, 2019, Ally Bank had $120.8 billion of total deposits-including $103.7 billion of retail deposits, which grew $14.6 billion, or 16% during 2019. Over the past several years, the continued growth of our retail-deposit base has contributed to a more favorable mix of lower cost funding and we continue to focus on efficient deposit growth by continuing to expand the deposit value proposition beyond competitive deposit rates. Our segment results include cost of funds associated with these deposit-product offerings.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOur deposit products and services are designed to develop long-term customer relationships and capitalize on the shift in consumer preference for direct banking. These products and services appeal to a broad group of customers, many of whom appreciate a streamlined digital experience coupled with our strong value proposition. Ally Bank offers a full spectrum of deposit product offerings, such as savings and money-market accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, CDs, including several raise-your-rate CD terms, IRAs, and trust accounts. Our deposit services include Zelle\u00ae person-to-person payment services, eCheck remote deposit capture, and mobile banking. In addition, brokered deposits are obtained through third-party intermediaries.\nWe believe we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from the consumer-driven shift from branch banking to direct banking as demonstrated by the growth we have experienced. Our nearly 2.0 million deposit customers and 4.0 million retail bank accounts as of December 31, 2019, reflect increases from 1.6 million and 3.2 million, respectively, as compared to December 31, 2018. Our customer base spans across diverse demographic segmentations and socioeconomic bands. Our direct bank business model resonates particularly well with the millennial generation, which consistently makes up the largest percentage of our new customers. According to a 2019 American Bankers Association survey, 83% of customers prefer to do their banking most often via digital and other direct channels (internet, mobile, telephone, and mail). Furthermore, over the past five years, estimated direct banking deposits as a percentage of the broader retail deposits market increased by approximately 3 percentage points, from 7% to 10%. We have received a positive response to innovative savings and other deposit products and have been recognized as a best online bank\u201d by industry and consumer publications. Ally Bank's competitive direct banking includes online and mobile banking features such as electronic bill pay, remote deposit, and electronic funds transfer nationwide, with innovative interfaces such as banking through Alexa-enabled devices, and no minimum balance requirements.\nWe intend to continue to grow and invest in our direct online bank and further capitalize on the shift in consumer preference for direct banking with expanded digital capabilities and customer-centric products that utilize advanced analytics for personalized interactions and other technologies that improve efficiency, security, and the customer's connection to the brand. We are focused on growing, deepening, and further leveraging the customer relationships and brand loyalty that exist with Ally Bank as a catalyst for future loan and deposit growth, as well as revenue opportunities that arise from introducing Ally Bank deposit customers to our digital wealth management offering, Ally Invest.\nFunding and Liquidity\nOur funding strategy targets a stable retail deposit base, supplemented by brokered deposits, public and private secured debt, and public unsecured debt. These diversified funding sources are managed across products, markets, and investors to enhance funding flexibility and stability, resulting in a more cost-effective long-term funding strategy.\nPrudent expansion of asset originations at Ally Bank and continued growth of a stable deposit base continue to be the cornerstone of our long-term liquidity strategy. Retail deposits provide a low-cost source of funds that are less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility, or changes in our credit ratings than other funding sources. At December 31, 2019, deposit liabilities totaled $120.8 billion, which reflects an increase of $14.6 billion as compared to December 31, 2018. Deposits as a percentage of total liability-based funding increased nine percentage points to 75% at December 31, 2019, as compared to December 31, 2018.\nIn addition to building a larger deposit base, we continue to remain active in the securitization markets to finance our automotive loan portfolios. During 2019, we issued $3.6 billion in securitizations backed by consumer automotive loans. Securitizations continue to be a reliable and cost-effective source of funding due to structural efficiencies and the established market. Additionally, for retail loans and operating leases, the term structure of the transaction locks in funding for a specified pool of loans and operating leases. Once a pool of consumer automotive loans is selected and placed into a securitization, the underlying assets and corresponding debt amortize simultaneously resulting in committed and matched funding for the life of the asset. We manage the execution risk arising from securitizations by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and committed secured credit facilities.\nAs we continue to migrate assets to Ally Bank and grow our bank funding capabilities, our need for funding at the parent company has been reduced. At December 31, 2019, 93% of Ally's total assets were within Ally Bank. This compares to approximately 89% as of December 31, 2018. Longer-term unsecured debt is the primary funding source utilized at the parent company. At December 31, 2019, we had $2.3 billion and $702 million of unsecured long-term debt principal maturing in 2020 and 2021, respectively. We plan to reduce our reliance on market-based funding by continuing to focus on stable, lower cost retail deposit funding.\nThe strategies outlined above have allowed us to build and maintain a conservative liquidity position. Total available liquidity at December 31, 2019, was $29.9 billion. Absolute levels of liquidity increased during 2019 primarily as a result of continued growth in our portfolio of highly liquid investment securities. Refer to the section below titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital for a further discussion about liquidity risk management.\nCredit Strategy\nOur strategy and approach to extending credit, as well as our management of credit risk, are critical elements of our business. Credit performance is influenced by a number of factors including our risk appetite, our credit and underwriting processes, our monitoring and collection efforts, the financial condition of our borrowers, the performance of loan collateral, and various macroeconomic considerations. The majority of our businesses offer credit products and services, which drive overall business performance. Consistent with our risk appetite, our business lines operate under credit standards that consider the borrower's ability and willingness to repay loans. The failure to effectively manage credit risk can have a direct and significant impact on Ally's earnings, capital position, and reputation. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for a further discussion of credit risk and performance of our consumer and commercial credit portfolios.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nWithin our Automotive Finance operations, we target a mix of consumers across the credit spectrum to achieve portfolio diversification and to optimize the risk and return of our consumer automotive portfolio. This is achieved through the utilization of robust credit decisioning processes coupled with granular pricing that is differentiated across our proprietary credit tiers. While we are a full-spectrum automotive finance lender, the significant majority of our consumer automotive loans are underwritten within the prime-lending segment. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses, as of December 31, 2019, was approximately 11.6%. During 2019, our strategy for originations was to optimize the deployment of capital by focusing on risk-adjusted returns against available origination opportunities, which has included a gradual and measured shift toward our Growth channel including used vehicle financings.\nThe Mortgage Finance team focuses on applicants with stronger credit profiles and with income streams to support repayments of the loan and operates under credit standards that consider and assess the value of the underlying real estate in accordance with prudent credit practices and regulatory requirements. Refer to the Mortgage Finance section of the MD&A that follows for credit quality information about purchases and originations of consumer mortgages held-for-investment. We generally rely on appraisals conducted by licensed appraisers in conformance with the expectations and requirements of Fannie Mae and federal regulators. When appropriate, we require credit enhancements such as private mortgage insurance. We price each mortgage loan that we originate based on a number of factors, including the customer's FICO\u00ae Score, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and the size of the loan. For bulk purchases, we only purchase loans from sellers with the financial wherewithal to support their representations and warranties and the experience to originate high-quality loans.\nAs further described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 1, 2019, we acquired Health Credit Services, a digital payment provider that operates under the name Ally Lending, and offers point-of-sale financing to consumers. This expansion into digital point-of-sale lending further broadens Ally's product portfolio to unsecured consumer financing. As of December 31, 2019, our gross carrying value of finance receivables related to Ally Lending was $212 million.\nWithin our commercial lending portfolios, Corporate Finance operations primarily provide senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle-market companies. During 2019, we continued to prudently grow this portfolio with a disciplined and selective approach to credit quality, which has generally included the avoidance of covenant-light lending arrangements. This includes growth of our lender finance vertical launched in 2019, which provides senior secured revolving credit facilities to asset managers, collateralized by a portfolio of loans. Within our commercial automotive business, we continue to offer a variety of dealer-centric lending products that primarily relate to floorplan financing and term loans. These commercial products are an important aspect of our dealer relationships and offer a secured lending arrangement with a number of strong collateral protections in the event of dealer default. The performance of our commercial credit portfolios continues to remain strong, as nonperforming finance receivables and loans decreased $134 million from December 31, 2018, to $215 million at December 31, 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, we recognized total net charge-offs of $49 million and $8 million, respectively, within our commercial lending portfolios, primarily driven by partial charge-offs of four exposures within our Corporate Finance portfolio, as well as three accounts within our commercial automotive portfolio. Despite the increase in net charge-offs, our total commercial net charge-off ratio represented 0.1% of average commercial receivables and loans for the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further details.\nDuring 2019, the U.S. economy continued to modestly expand, led by consumer spending. The labor market remained robust during the year, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.5% as of December 31, 2019. Our credit portfolios will continue to be impacted by household, business, economic, and market conditions-including used vehicle and housing price levels, and unemployment levels-and their impact to our borrowers. We expect to experience modest downward pressure on used vehicle values during 2020.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuring 2013 and 2012, certain disposal groups met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. The remaining activity relates to previous discontinued operations for which we continue to have wind-down, legal, and minimal operational costs. For all periods presented, the operating results for these operations have been removed from continuing operations. The MD&A has been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nPrimary Business Lines\nDealer Financial Services, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance are our primary business lines.

billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, results were favorably impacted by higher net financing revenue, primarily driven by higher yields and growth in earning assets. Results for the year ended December 31, 2019, were also favorably impacted by a release of valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards during the second quarter of 2019, and higher market values of equity investments primarily within our Insurance operations. These items were partially offset by higher provision for loan losses, and higher noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet financing revenue and other interest income increased $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Within our Automotive Finance operations, consumer automotive financing revenue benefited from improved portfolio yields as a result of our continued focus on expanding risk-adjusted returns, and higher average consumer asset levels resulting from sustained asset growth. During the year ended December 31, 2019, commercial automotive net financing revenue also increased due primarily to higher yields resulting from higher average benchmark interest rates. Income from interest and dividends on investment securities and other earning assets, including cash and cash equivalents, increased $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, due to both higher yields and higher balances of investment securities as we continue to utilize this portfolio to manage liquidity and generate a stable source of income. Financing revenue and other interest income within our Corporate Finance operations was favorably impacted by our strategy to prudently grow assets and our product suite within existing verticals while selectively pursuing opportunities to broaden industry and product diversification. The increase to financing revenue and other interest income was partially offset by an increase of 17% in total interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWhile we continue to shift borrowings toward more cost-effective deposit funding and reduce our dependence on market-based funding through reductions in higher-cost secured and unsecured debt, interest expense increased as a result of higher market rates across all funding\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nsources. Additionally, our overall borrowing levels were higher to support the growth in our lending operations. Our total deposit liabilities increased $14.6 billion to $120.8 billion as of December 31, 2019, as compared to December 31, 2018.\nInsurance premiums and service revenue earned was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $1.0 billion for 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to vehicle inventory insurance portfolio growth and rate increases.\nOther gain on investments, net increased $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due to favorable market conditions during the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain on investments for the year ended December 31, 2019, includes $92 million of unrealized gains as a result of changes in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities, compared to $121 million of unrealized losses in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe provision for loan losses was $998 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $918 million in 2018. The increase in provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by reserve reductions during the year ended December 31, 2018, associated with hurricane activity experienced during 2017 within our consumer automotive loan portfolio, the acquisition of the Health Credit Services portfolio, and increases within the corporate finance portfolio due to favorable credit ratings migration in 2018 and portfolio growth, as well as a $6 million recovery of a previously charged-off loan in the second quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting and higher recoveries. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion on our provision for loan losses.\nNoninterest expense increased $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was driven by increased expenses to support the growth of our consumer product suite. We continue to make investments in our technology platform to enhance the customer experience and expand our digital capabilities, and in marketing activities to promote brand awareness and drive retail deposit growth. Additionally, the increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was driven by higher insurance losses and loss adjustment expense within our insurance operations primarily related to growth experienced in our portfolio of products.\nWe recognized total income tax expense from continuing operations of $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $359 million in 2018. The decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to a release of valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards during the second quarter of 2019. The valuation allowance release was primarily driven by our current capacity to engage in certain foreign securitization transactions and the market demand from investors related to these transactions, coupled with the anticipated timing of the forecasted expiration of certain foreign tax credit carryforwards. Additionally, the decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was partially offset by the tax effects of an increase in pretax earnings and a nonrecurring tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance against state net operating loss carryforwards as a result of a state tax law enactment in the third quarter of 2018.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nDealer Financial Services\nResults for Dealer Financial Services are presented by reportable segment, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations.\nAutomotive Finance\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of our Automotive Finance operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we continued to focus on driving capital optimization and expanding risk-adjusted returns. As a result, we experienced higher consumer loan financing revenue, primarily due to an increase in consumer loan portfolio yields and asset levels. We also experienced higher commercial financing revenue due to higher yields resulting from higher average benchmark interest rates. Growth in finance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, was partially offset by higher interest expense driven by higher funding costs and growth in our consumer loan portfolio as well as an increase in provision for loan losses.\nConsumer automotive loan financing revenue increased $488 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to improved portfolio yields as a result of our continued focus on expanding risk-adjusted returns, and higher average consumer asset levels resulting from sustained asset growth, including a continued focus on the used-vehicle portfolio primarily through franchised dealers and growth in application volume from our dealer network. Through these actions, we continue to optimize our origination mix and achieve greater portfolio diversification.\nCommercial loan financing revenue increased $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher yields resulting from higher average benchmark interest rates. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in average outstanding floorplan assets compared to 2018.\nInterest expense was $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $2.5 billion for the year in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher funding costs and growth in our consumer automotive loan portfolio.\nWe recorded gains from the sale of consumer automotive loans of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to gains of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We continue to selectively utilize whole-loan sales to proactively manage our credit exposure, asset levels, funding, and capital utilization, including the sale of previously written-down consumer automotive loans related to consumers in Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nOther income decreased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in servicing fee income resulting from lower levels of off-balance-sheet consumer automotive serviced loans and also attributable to a decrease in remarketing fee income resulting from lower operating lease termination volume.\nTotal net operating lease revenue increased $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to favorable performance and mix in our outstanding lease portfolio. Additionally, we recognized lower remarketing gains of $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $90 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a lower number of terminated units and lower gain per unit. The lower number of terminated units was primarily due to the runoff of our legacy GM operating lease portfolio, which was substantially wound-down as of June 30, 2018. Refer to the Operating Lease Residual Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe provision for loan losses was $962 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $920 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in provision for loan losses was primarily driven by reserve reductions during the year ended December 31, 2018, associated with hurricane activity experienced during 2017 in our consumer automotive loan portfolio. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting, and higher recoveries. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAutomotive Financing Volume\nOur Automotive Finance operations provide automotive financing services to consumers and automotive dealers. For consumers, we provide retail financing and leasing for new and used vehicles, and through our commercial automotive financing operations, we fund dealer purchases of new and used vehicles through wholesale floorplan financing and provide dealer term and revolving loans and automotive fleet financing.\nAcquisition and Underwriting\nOur consumer underwriting process is focused on multidimensional risk factors and data driven risk-adjusted probabilities that are continuously monitored and routinely updated. Each application is placed into an analytical category based on specific aspects of the applicant's credit profile and loan structure. We then evaluate the application by applying a proprietary credit scoring algorithm tailored to its applicable category. Inputs into this algorithm include, but are not limited to, proprietary scores and deal structure variables such as LTV, new or used vehicle collateral, and term of financing. The output of the algorithm is used to sort applications into various credit tiers (S, A, B, C, D, and E). Credit tiers help determine our primary indication of credit quality and pricing, and are also communicated to the dealer that submitted the application. This process is built on long established credit risk fundamentals to determine both the applicant's ability and willingness to repay. While advances in excess of 100% of the vehicle collateral value at loan origination-notwithstanding cash down and vehicle trade in value-are typical in the industry (primarily due to additional costs such as mechanical warranty contracts, taxes, license, and title fees), our pricing, risk, and underwriting processes are rooted in statistical analysis to manage this risk.\nOur underwriting process uses a combination of automated strategies and manual evaluation by an experienced team of dedicated underwriters. We have developed an automated process to expedite the review of applications with various combinations of credit factors that we have observed over time to substantially outperform or underperform in terms of net credit losses. As a result, automated decisions are based on many clusters of credit factors rather than a small set of benchmark characteristics. Automated approvals are primarily limited to the higher-quality credit tiers and automated rejections to lower-quality credit tiers. Underwriting is also governed by our credit policies, which set forth guidelines such as acceptable transaction parameters and verification requirements. For higher-risk approved transactions, these guidelines require verification of details such as applicant income and employment through documentation provided by the applicant or other data sources.\nUnderwriters have a limited ability to approve exceptions to the guidelines in our credit policies. For example, an exception may be approved to allow a term or a ratio of payment-to-income, debt-to-income, or LTV greater than that in the guidelines. Exceptions must be approved by underwriters with appropriate approval authority and generally are based on compensating factors. We monitor exceptions with the goal of limiting them to a small portion of approved applications and originated loans, and rarely permit more than a single exception to avoid layered risk.\nConsumer Automotive Financing\nNew- and used-vehicle consumer financing through dealerships takes one of two forms: retail installment sales contracts (retail contracts) and operating lease contracts. We purchase retail contracts for new and used vehicles and operating lease contracts from dealers after those contracts are executed by the dealers and the consumers. Our consumer automotive financing operations generate revenue primarily through finance charges on retail contracts and rental payments on operating lease contracts. In connection with operating lease contracts, we recognize depreciation expense on the vehicle over the operating lease contract period and we may also recognize a gain or loss on the remarketing of the vehicle at the end of the lease.\nThe amount we pay a dealer for a retail contract is based on the rate of finance charge agreed by the dealer and customer, the negotiated purchase price of the vehicle, any other products such as service contracts, less any vehicle trade-in value, any down payment from the consumer, and any available automotive manufacturer incentives. Under the retail contract, the consumer is obligated to make payments in an amount equal to the purchase price of the vehicle (less any trade-in or down payment) plus finance charges at a rate negotiated between the consumer and the dealer. In addition, the consumer is responsible for charges related to past-due payments. Consistent with industry practice, when we purchase the retail contract, we pay the dealer at a rate discounted below the rate agreed by the dealer and the consumer (generally described in the industry as the buy rate\u201d). Our agreements with dealers limit the amount of the discount that we will accept. Although we do not own the vehicles that we finance through retail contracts, our agreements require that we hold a perfected security interest in those vehicles.\nWith respect to consumer leasing, we purchase operating lease contracts and the associated vehicles from dealerships after those contracts are executed by the dealers and the consumers. The amount we pay a dealer for an operating lease contract is based on the negotiated price for the vehicle, less any vehicle trade-in, any down payment from the consumer, and any available automotive manufacturer incentives. Under an operating lease, the consumer is obligated to make payments in amounts equal to the amount by which the negotiated purchase price of the vehicle (less any trade-in value, down payment, or any available manufacturer incentives) exceeds the contract residual value (including residual support) of the vehicle at lease termination, plus operating lease rental charges. The consumer is also generally responsible for charges related to past-due payments, excess mileage, excessive wear and tear, and certain disposal fees where applicable. At contract inception, we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle. This evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model, which includes variables such as vehicle age, expected mileage, seasonality, segment factors, vehicle type, economic indicators, production cycle, automotive manufacturer incentives, and shifts in used vehicle supply. This internally generated data is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nPeriodically, we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on then-current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense, if appropriate, over the remaining life of the contract. At termination, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense.\nOur standard consumer operating lease contract, SmartLease, requires a monthly payment by the consumer. We also offer an alternative leasing plan, SmartLease Plus, which requires one up-front payment of all operating lease amounts at the time the consumer takes possession of the vehicle.\nOur standard consumer lease contracts are operating leases; therefore, credit losses on the operating lease portfolio are not as significant as losses on retail contracts because lease credit losses are primarily limited to past-due payments and assessed fees. Since some of these fees are not assessed until the vehicle is returned, these losses on the operating lease portfolio are correlated with lease termination volume. Operating lease accounts over 30 days past due represented 1.34% and 1.48% of the portfolio at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nWith respect to all financed vehicles, whether subject to a retail contract or an operating lease contract, we require that property damage insurance be obtained by the consumer. In addition, for operating lease contracts, we require that bodily injury, collision, and comprehensive insurance be obtained by the consumer.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our portfolio yield for consumer automotive loans increased 46 basis points relative to the year ended December 31, 2018. We set our buy rates using a granular, risk-based methodology factoring in several variables including interest costs, projected net average annualized loss rates at the time of origination, anticipated operating costs, and targeted return on equity. Over the past several years, we have continued to focus on optimizing pricing relative to market interest rates as well as portfolio diversification and the used-vehicle segment, primarily through franchised dealers, which has contributed to higher yields on our consumer automotive loan portfolio. Commensurate with this shift in origination mix, we continue to maintain consistent, disciplined underwriting within our new and used consumer automotive loan originations. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.4 billion, or approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to $8.3 billion, or approximately 11.7% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table presents retail loan originations by credit tier and product

Originations with a FICO\u00ae Score of less than 620 (considered nonprime) represented 11% of total consumer loan and operating lease originations for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 10% for year ended December 31, 2018. Consumer loans and operating leases with FICO\u00ae Scores of less than 540 continued to compose only 1% of total originations for the year ended December 31, 2019. Nonprime applications that are not automatically declined by our proprietary credit-scoring models for risk reasons are manually reviewed and decisioned by an experienced underwriting team. Nonprime applications are subject to more stringent underwriting criteria (for example, minimum payment-to-income ratio and vehicle mileage, and maximum amount financed), and our nonprime loan portfolio generally does not include any loans with a term of 76 months or more. For discussion of our credit-risk-management practices and performance, refer to the section titled Risk Management.\nManufacturer Marketing Incentives\nAutomotive manufacturers may elect to sponsor incentive programs on retail contracts and operating leases by subsidizing finance rates below market rates. These marketing incentives are also referred to as rate support or subvention. When an automotive manufacturer subsidizes the finance rate, we are compensated at contract inception for the present value of the difference between the manufacturer-supported customer rate and our standard rate. For a retail contract, we defer and recognize this amount as a yield adjustment over the life of the contract. For an operating lease contract, this payment reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset.\nAutomotive manufacturers may also elect to sponsor incentives, referred to as residual support, on operating leases. When an automotive manufacturer provides residual support, we receive payment at contract inception that increases the contractual operating lease residual value resulting in a lower operating lease payment from the customer. The payment received from the automotive manufacturer reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset. Other operating lease incentive programs sponsored by automotive manufacturers may be made at contract inception indirectly through dealers, which also reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset.\nUnder what the automotive finance industry refers to as pull-ahead programs,\u201d consumers may be encouraged by the manufacturer to terminate operating leases early in conjunction with the acquisition of a new vehicle. As part of these programs, we waive all or a portion of\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nthe customer's remaining payment obligation. Under most programs, the automotive manufacturer compensates us for a portion of the foregone revenue from the waived payments. This compensation may be partially offset to the extent that our remarketing sales proceeds are higher than otherwise would be realized if the vehicle had been remarketed upon contract maturity.\nServicing\nWe have historically serviced all retail contracts and operating leases we originated. However, our expansion into direct-to-consumer lending and other relationships have resulted in the employment of third-party servicers for a small portion of the portfolio. On occasion, we have sold a portion of the retail contracts we originated through whole-loan sales and securitizations, but generally retained the right to service and earn a servicing fee for our servicing functions.\nServicing activities consist largely of collecting and processing customer payments, responding to customer concerns and inquiries, processing customer requests (including those for payoff quotes, total-loss handling, and payment modifications), maintaining a perfected security interest in the financed vehicle, engaging in collections activity, and disposing of off-lease and repossessed vehicles. Servicing activities are generally consistent across our Automotive Finance operations; however, certain practices may be influenced by state laws.\nOur customers have the option to receive monthly billing statements and remit payment by mail or through electronic fund transfers, or to establish online web-based account administration through Ally Auto Online Services. Customer payments are processed by regional third-party processing centers that electronically transfer payment information to customers' accounts.\nCollections activity includes initiating contact with customers who fail to comply with the terms of the retail contract or operating lease agreement by sending reminder notices or contacting customers via various channels when an account becomes 3 to 20 days past due. The type of collection treatment and level of intensity increases as the account becomes more delinquent. The nature and timing of these activities depend on the repayment risk of the account.\nDuring the collections process, we may offer a payment extension to a customer experiencing temporary financial difficulty. A payment extension enables the customer to delay monthly payments for 30, 60, or 90 days. Extensions granted to a customer typically do not exceed 90 days in the aggregate during any 12-month period or 180 days in aggregate over the life of the contract. During the extension period, finance charges continue to accrue. If the customer's financial difficulty is not temporary but we believe the customer is willing and able to repay their loan at a lower payment amount, we may offer to modify the remaining obligation, extending the term and lowering the scheduled monthly payment. In those cases, the outstanding balance generally remains unchanged. The use of extensions and modifications helps us mitigate financial loss. Extensions may assist in cases where we believe the customer will recover from short-term financial difficulty and resume regularly scheduled payments. Modifications may also be utilized in cases where we believe customers can fulfill the obligation with lower payments over a longer period. Before offering an extension or modification, we evaluate and take into account the capacity of the customer to meet the revised payment terms. Generally, we do not consider extensions that fall within our policy guidelines to represent more than an insignificant delay in payment, and therefore, they are not considered a Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR). Although the granting of an extension could delay the eventual charge-off of an account, typically we are able to repossess and sell the related collateral, thereby mitigating the loss. At December 31, 2019, 10.6% of the total amount outstanding in the servicing portfolio had been granted an extension or was rewritten, compared to 11.3% at December 31, 2018.\nSubject to legal considerations, we normally begin repossession activity once an account is at least eighty-five days past due. Repossession may occur earlier if we determine the customer is unwilling to pay, the vehicle is in danger of being damaged or hidden, or the customer voluntarily surrenders the vehicle. Approved third-party repossession vendors handle the repossession activity. Generally, after repossession, the customer is given a period of time to redeem the vehicle or reinstate the contract by paying off the account or bringing the account current, respectively. If the vehicle is not redeemed or the contract is not reinstated, the vehicle is sold at auction. If the proceeds do not cover the unpaid balance, including unpaid earned finance charges and allowable expenses, the resulting deficiency is charged-off. Asset recovery centers pursue collections on accounts that have been charged-off, including those accounts where the vehicle was repossessed, and skip accounts where the vehicle cannot be located.\nOur total consumer automotive serviced portfolio was $80.6 billion and $79.7 billion at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively, compared to our consumer automotive on-balance-sheet serviced portfolio of $80.0 billion and $77.8 billion.\nRemarketing and Sales of Leased Vehicles\nWhen we acquire an operating lease, we assume ownership of the vehicle from the dealer. Neither the consumer nor the dealer is responsible for the value of the vehicle at the time of lease termination. When vehicles are not purchased by customers or the receiving dealer at scheduled lease termination, the vehicle is returned to us for remarketing. We generally bear the risk of loss to the extent the value of a leased vehicle upon remarketing is below the expected residual value. Our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and the proceeds realized from vehicle sales. Our methods of vehicle sales at lease termination primarily include the following:\n \u2022 Sale to dealer - After the lessee declines an option to purchase the off-lease vehicle, the dealer who accepts it has the opportunity to purchase it directly from us at a price we define. \n \u2022 Internet auctions - Once the lessee and the dealer decline to purchase the off-lease vehicle, we offer it to dealers and other third parties through our proprietary internet site (SmartAuction). Through SmartAuction, we seek to maximize the net sales proceeds from an off-lease vehicle by reducing the time between vehicle return and ultimate disposition, reducing holding costs, and \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nbroadening the number of prospective buyers. We use SmartAuction for our own vehicles and make it available for third-party use. We earn a service fee for every third-party vehicle sold through SmartAuction, which includes the cost of ClearGuard coverage, our protection product designed to assist in minimizing the risk to dealers of arbitration claims for eligible vehicles. In 2019, approximately 270,000 vehicles were sold through SmartAuction.\n \u2022 Physical auctions - We dispose of an off-lease vehicle not purchased at termination by the lessee or dealer or sold on SmartAuction through traditional third-party, physical auctions. We are responsible for handling decisions at the auction including arranging for inspections, authorizing repairs and reconditioning, and determining whether bids received at auction should be accepted.  We employ an internal team, including statisticians, to manage our analysis of projected used vehicle values and residual risk. This team aids in the pricing of new operating leases, managing the disposal process including vehicle concentration risk, geographic optimization of vehicles to maximize gains, disposal platform (internet vs. physical), and evaluating our residual risk on a real-time basis. This team tracks market movements of used vehicles using data down to the VIN level including trim and options, vehicle age, mileage, and seasonality factors that we feel are more relevant than other published indices (for example, Manheim, NADA). This analysis includes vehicles sold on our SmartAuction platform, as well as vehicles sold through Manheim, ADESA, and over 200 independent physical auction sites. We believe this analysis gives us a competitive advantage over our peers.\nCommercial Automotive Financing\nAutomotive Wholesale Dealer Financing\nOne of the most important aspects of our dealer relationships is providing wholesale floorplan financing for new- and used-vehicle inventories at dealerships. Wholesale floorplan financing, including syndicated loan arrangements, represents the largest portion of our commercial automotive financing business and is the primary source of funding for dealers' purchases of new and used vehicles.\nWholesale floorplan financing is generally extended in the form of lines of credit to individual dealers. These lines of credit are secured by the vehicles financed and all other vehicle inventory, which provide strong collateral protection in the event of dealership default. Additional collateral (for example, blanket lien over all dealership assets) or other credit enhancements (for example, personal guarantees from dealership owners) are generally obtained to further mitigate credit risk. Furthermore, in some cases, we may benefit from situations where an automotive manufacturer repurchases vehicles. These repurchases may serve as an additional layer of protection in the event of repossession of dealership new-vehicle inventory or dealership franchise termination. The amount we advance to dealers for a new vehicle is equal to 100% of the manufacturer's wholesale invoice price. The amount we advance to dealers for a used vehicle is typically 90-100% of the dealer's cost of acquiring it. Interest on wholesale floorplan financing is generally payable monthly. The majority of wholesale floorplan financing is structured to yield interest at a floating rate indexed to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) or the Prime Rate. The rate for a particular dealer is based on, among other things, competitive factors, the size of the account, and the dealer's creditworthiness. Additionally, under our Ally Dealer Rewards Program, dealers benefit in certain circumstances from wholesale-floorplan-financing incentives, which we credit and account for as a reduction to interest income in the period they are earned.\nUnder our wholesale-floorplan-financing agreement, a dealership is generally required to pay the principal amount financed for a vehicle within a specified number of days following the dealership's sale or lease of the vehicle. The agreement also affords us the right to demand payment of all amounts owed under the wholesale credit line at any time. We, however, generally make this demand only if we terminate the credit line, the dealer defaults, or a risk-based reason exists to do so.\nCommercial Wholesale Financing Volume\nThe following table presents the percentage of average balance of our commercial wholesale floorplan finance receivables, in dollars, by product type and by channel.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average balance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GM new vehicles\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chrysler new vehicles\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth new vehicles\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used vehicles\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial wholesale finance receivables\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage commercial wholesale financing receivables outstanding decreased $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of GM dealer relationships due to the competitive environment across the automotive lending market and reduced dealer inventory levels, partially offset by higher average vehicle prices. Dealer inventory levels are dependent on a number of factors, including manufacturer production schedules and vehicle mix, sales incentives, and industry sales-all of which can influence future wholesale balances. Manufacturer production and corresponding dealer stock levels, as well as dealer penetration levels, may continue to influence our future wholesale balances during 2020.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOther Commercial Automotive Financing\nWe also provide other forms of commercial financing for the automotive industry including automotive dealer term and revolving loans and automotive fleet financing. Automotive dealer term and revolving loans are loans that we make to dealers to finance other aspects of the dealership business, including acquisitions. These loans are usually secured by real estate or other dealership assets and are typically personally guaranteed by the individual owners of the dealership. Additionally, we generally also have cross-collateral and cross-default provisions in place with dealers. Automotive fleet financing credit lines may be obtained by dealers, their affiliates, and other independent companies that are used to purchase vehicles, which they lease or rent to others. The average balances of other commercial automotive loans decreased 6% to $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nServicing and Monitoring\nWe service all of the wholesale credit lines in our portfolio and the wholesale automotive finance receivables that we have securitized. A statement setting forth billing and account information is distributed on a monthly basis to each dealer. Interest and other nonprincipal charges are billed in arrears and are required to be paid immediately upon receipt of the monthly billing statement. Generally, dealers remit payments to us through ACH transactions initiated by the dealer through a secure web application.\nWe manage risk related to wholesale floorplan financing by assessing dealership borrowers using a proprietary model based on various factors, including their capital sufficiency, operating performance, and credit and payment history. This model assigns dealership borrowers a risk rating that affects the amount of the line of credit and the ongoing risk management of the account. We monitor the level of borrowing under each dealer's credit line daily. We may adjust the dealer's credit line if warranted, based on the dealership's vehicle sales rate, and temporarily suspend the granting of additional credit, or take other actions following evaluation and analysis of the dealer's financial condition.\nWe periodically inspect and verify the existence of dealer vehicle inventories. The timing of these collateral audits varies, and no advance notice is given to the dealer. Among other things, audits are intended to assess dealer compliance with the financing agreement and confirm the status of our collateral.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nInsurance\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of our Insurance operations.

The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by $88 million of net unrealized gains on investments due to favorable market conditions within our equity portfolio, compared to net unrealized losses of $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInsurance premiums and service revenue earned was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to vehicle inventory insurance portfolio growth and rate increases.\nInsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled $321 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $295 million in 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by vehicle inventory insurance portfolio growth and higher VSC, GAP, and other policies in force. Total acquisition and underwriting expense increased $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to an increase in insurance commissions expense, driven by growth in our written insurance premiums and service revenue. Growth in insurance premiums and service revenue earned outpaced expense increases, which led to a decrease in the combined ratio to 92.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 92.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. In April 2019, we renewed our annual reinsurance program and continue to utilize this coverage to manage our risk of weather-related loss.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nPremium and Service Revenue Written\nThe following table summarizes premium and service revenue written by product, net of premiums ceded to reinsurers.

The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to higher prepayment activity, an increase in provision for loan losses, and higher noninterest expense driven primarily by continued asset growth. The decrease was partially offset by growth in our mortgage loan portfolio and an increase in the net gain on sale of mortgage loans.\nNet financing revenue and other interest income was $171 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $179 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to accelerated premium amortization on purchased loans due to higher prepayment activity driven by a lower interest rate environment, partially offset by increased loan balances as a result of bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans and direct-to-consumer originations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased $3.5 billion of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties and originated $2.0 billion of mortgage loans held-for-investment, compared to $4.4 billion and $401 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain on sale of mortgage loans, net, was $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by higher direct-to-consumer mortgage originations and the subsequent sale of these loans to our fulfillment provider, and the execution of whole-loan sales during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we originated $738 million of loans held-for-sale compared to $302 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of reserve releases for the year ended December 31, 2018, that did not reoccur.\nTotal noninterest expense was $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by continued asset growth.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the total unpaid principal

The increase was due primarily to higher net financing revenue and other interest income resulting from higher asset levels, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses recognized during the first quarter of 2019.\nNet financing revenue and other interest income was $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $204 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the growth of our loan portfolio, represented by a 23% increase in the gross carrying value of finance receivables and loans. Growth in the portfolio was primarily driven by asset-based lending, including our lender finance vertical, which provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct lending activities.\nOther revenue was $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by higher unrealized losses on equity securities in 2018, partially offset by lower fee income.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by higher reserves associated with favorable credit ratings migration in 2018 and portfolio growth, as well as a $6 million recovery of a previously charged-off loan recognized during the second quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur.\nTotal noninterest expense was $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $86 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense and other noninterest costs associated with growth in the business.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nCredit Portfolio\nThe following table presents loans held-for-sale, the gross carrying value of finance receivables and loans outstanding, unfunded commitments to lend, and total serviced loans of our Corporate Finance operations.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans held-for-sale, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance receivables and loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded lending commitments (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total serviced loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes unused revolving credit line commitments for loans held-for-sale and finance receivables and loans, signed commitment letters, and standby letter of credit facilities, which are issued on behalf of clients and may contingently require us to make payments to a third-party beneficiary in the event of a draw by the beneficiary thereunder.

The increase in total financing revenue and other interest income from our investment securities portfolio and higher other revenue was more than offset by higher funding costs from higher market rates and deposit growth.\nFinancing revenue and other interest income was $960 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $815 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by growth in the size of the investment portfolio and higher interest and dividends from investment securities, primarily as a result of higher balances.\nTotal interest expense was $932 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $631 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased interest on deposits resulting from higher market rates and deposit growth, partially offset by a decrease in higher-cost secured and unsecured debt borrowings.\nTotal other revenue was $171 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $119 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased realized investment gains, partially offset by lower income related to certain equity hedges, and lower commission revenues.\nTotal assets were $36.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $34.0 billion as of December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily the result of growth in our available-for-sale securities portfolio. The increase was partially offset by a decline in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio and the continued runoff of our legacy mortgage portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the gross carrying value of the legacy mortgage portfolio was $1.1 billion, compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018.\nCash and Securities\nThe following table summarizes the composition of the cash and securities portfolio at fair value for Corporate and Other.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury and federal agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. States and political subdivisions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency mortgage-backed residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency mortgage-backed commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Held-to-maturity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency mortgage-backed residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed retained notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total held-to-maturity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAlly Invest\nAlly Invest is our digital brokerage and wealth management offering, which enables us to complement our competitive deposit products with low-cost and commission-free investing.

The RC sets the risk appetite across our company while risk-oriented management committees, the executive leadership team, and our associates identify and monitor current and emerging risks and manage those risks within our risk appetite. Our primary types of risk include the following:\n \u2022 Credit risk - The risk of loss arising from an obligor not meeting its contractual obligations to us. \n \u2022 Insurance/underwriting risk - The risk of loss or of adverse change in the value of insurance liabilities, due to inadequate pricing and provisioning assumptions. \n \u2022 Liquidity risk - The risk that our financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions. Refer to discussion in the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital within this MD&A. \n \u2022 Market risk - The risk that movements in market variables such as benchmark interest rates, investors' required risk premium, foreign-exchange rates, equity prices, and used car prices may adversely affect our earnings, capital, or economic value. Market risk includes interest rate risk, investment risk, and lease residual risk. \n \u2022 Business/strategic risk - The risk resulting from the pursuit of business plans that turn out to be unsuccessful due to a variety of factors. \n \u2022 Reputation risk - The risk arising from negative public opinion on our business practices, whether true or not, that could cause a decline in the customer base, litigation, or revenue reductions. \n \u2022 Operational risk - The risk of loss or harm arising from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors, or external events. \n \u2022 Information technology/security risk - The risk resulting from the failure of, or insufficiency in, information technology (for example, a system outage) or intentional or accidental unauthorized access, sharing, removal, tampering, or disposal of company and customer data or records. \n \u2022 Compliance risk - The risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to the banking organization (applicable rules and standards). \n \u2022 Conduct risk - The risk of customer harm, employee harm, reputational damage, regulatory sanction, or financial loss resulting from the behavior of our employees and contractors toward customers, counterparties, other employees and contractors, or the markets in which we operate.  Our risk-governance structure starts within each business line, including committees established to oversee risk in their respective areas. The business lines are responsible for their risk-based performance and compliance with risk-management policies and applicable law.\nThe independent risk-management function is accountable for independently identifying, monitoring, measuring, and reporting on our various risks and for designing an effective risk-management framework and structure. The independent risk-management function is also responsible for developing, maintaining, and implementing enterprise risk-management policies. In addition, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) is responsible for supporting the Chief Risk Officer's oversight of senior management's responsibility to execute on our strategy within our risk appetite set by the RC, and the Chief Risk Officer's implementation of our independent risk-management program. The Chief Risk Officer reports to the RC, as well as administratively to the Chief Executive Officer.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAll business lines are subject to full and unrestricted audits by Audit Services. The Chief Audit Executive reports to the Audit Committee of our Board (AC), as well as administratively to the Chief Executive Officer, and is primarily responsible for assisting the AC in fulfilling its governance and oversight responsibilities. Audit Services is granted free and unrestricted access to any and all of our records, physical properties, technologies, management, and employees.\nIn addition, our Loan Review Group provides an independent assessment of the quality of our extensions of credit and credit-risk-management practices, and all business lines that create or influence credit risk are subject to full and unrestricted reviews by the Loan Review Group. This group is also granted free and unrestricted access to any and all of our records, physical properties, technologies, management and employees, and reports directly to the RC.\nLoan and Operating Lease Exposure\nThe following table summarizes the exposures from our loan and operating-lease activities.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance receivables and loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive Finance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Finance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Finance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total finance receivables and loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive Finance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Finance (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Finance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total on-balance-sheet loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-balance-sheet securitized loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive Finance (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Whole-loan sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive Finance (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total off-balance-sheet loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive Finance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loan and operating lease exposure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion of consumer mortgage loans in our legacy mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. \n (b) Represents the current balance of conforming mortgages originated directly to the held-for-sale portfolio. \n (c) Represents the current unpaid principal balance of outstanding loans, which are subject to our customary representation, warranty, and covenant provisions.  The risks inherent in our loan and operating lease exposures are largely driven by changes in the overall economy, used vehicle and housing prices, unemployment levels, and their impact on our borrowers. The potential financial statement impact of these exposures varies depending on the accounting classification and future expected disposition strategy. We retain the majority of our consumer automotive loans as they complement our core business model, but we do sell loans from time to time on an opportunistic basis. We ultimately manage the associated risks based on the underlying economics of the exposure. Our operating lease residual risk may be more volatile than credit risk in stressed macroeconomic scenarios. While all operating leases are exposed to potential reductions in used vehicle values, only loans where we take possession of the vehicle are affected by potential reductions in used vehicle values.\n \u2022 Finance receivables and loans - Loans that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity, or loans associated with an on-balance-sheet securitization classified as secured borrowing. Finance receivables and loans are reported at their gross carrying value, which includes the principal amount outstanding, net of unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, unamortized premiums and discounts on purchased loans, unamortized basis adjustments arising from the designation of finance receivables and loans as the hedged item in qualifying fair value hedge relationships, and cumulative principal charge-offs. We refer to the gross carrying value less the allowance for loan loss as the net carrying value in finance receivables and loans. We manage the economic risks of these exposures, including credit risk, by adjusting underwriting standards and risk limits, augmenting our servicing and collection activities (including loan modifications and restructurings), and optimizing \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nour product and geographic concentrations. Additionally, we may elect to account for certain loans at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these loans are recognized in a valuation allowance separate from the allowance for loan losses and are reflected in current period earnings. We use market-based instruments, such as derivatives, to hedge changes in the fair value of these loans.\n \u2022 Loans held-for-sale - Loans that we do not have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity. These loans are recorded on our balance sheet at the lower of their net carrying value or fair market value and are evaluated by portfolio and product type. Changes in the recorded value are recognized in a valuation allowance and reflected in current period earnings. We manage the economic risks of these exposures, including market and credit risks, in various ways including the use of market-based instruments, such as derivatives. \n \u2022 Off-balance-sheet securitized loans - Loans that we transfer off-balance sheet to nonconsolidated variable interest entities. Our exposure is primarily limited to customary representation, warranty, and covenant provisions. Similar to finance receivables and loans, we manage the economic risks of these exposures through activities including servicing and collections. \n \u2022 Whole-loan sales - Loans that we transfer off-balance sheet to third-party investors. Our exposure is primarily limited to customary representation, warranty and covenant provisions. Similar to finance receivables and loans, we manage the economic risks of these exposures through activities including servicing and collections. \n \u2022 Operating lease assets - The net book value of the automotive assets we lease includes the expected residual values upon remarketing the vehicles at the end of the lease and is reported net of accumulated depreciation. We are exposed to fluctuations in the expected residual value upon remarketing the vehicle at the end of the lease, and as such at contract inception, we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle. This evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model, which includes variables such as age, expected mileage, seasonality, segment factors, vehicle type, economic indicators, production cycle, automotive manufacturer incentives, and shifts in used vehicle supply. This internally generated data is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. Periodically, we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense appropriately over the remaining life of the contract. At termination, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense. The balance sheet reflects both the operating lease asset as well as any associated rent receivables. The operating lease rent receivable is accrued when collection is reasonably assured and presented as a component of other assets. The operating lease asset is reviewed for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  Refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates within this MD&A and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from an obligor not meeting its contractual obligations to us. Credit risk includes consumer credit risk, commercial credit risk, and counterparty credit risk.\nCredit risk is a major source of potential economic loss to us. Credit risk is monitored by the risk committees, executive leadership team, and our associates. Together, they oversee credit decisioning, account servicing activities, and credit-risk-management processes, and manage credit risk exposures within our risk appetite. In addition, our Loan Review Group provides an independent assessment of the quality of our credit portfolios and credit-risk-management practices, and reports its findings to the RC on a regular basis.\nTo mitigate risk, we have implemented specific policies and practices across business lines, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative analyses. This reflects our commitment to maintaining an independent and ongoing assessment of credit risk and credit quality. Our policies require an objective and timely assessment of the overall quality of the consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios. This includes the identification of relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolios, segments of the portfolios that are potential problem areas, loans and operating leases with potential credit weaknesses, and the assessment of the adequacy of internal credit risk policies and procedures. Our consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios are subject to regular stress tests that are based on plausible, but unexpected, economic scenarios to assess how the portfolios may perform in a severe economic downturn. In addition, we establish and maintain underwriting policies and limits across our portfolios and higher risk segments (for example, nonprime) based on our risk appetite.\nAnother important aspect to managing credit risk involves the need to carefully monitor and manage the performance and pricing of our loan products with the aim of generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns. When considering pricing, various granular risk-based factors are considered such as expected loss rates, loss volatility, anticipated operating costs, and targeted returns on equity. We carefully monitor credit losses and trends in credit losses relative to expected credit losses at contract inception. We closely monitor our loan performance and profitability in light of forecasted economic conditions and manage credit risk and expectations of losses in the portfolio.\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, the source of repayment, the underlying collateral, and current market conditions. We monitor the credit risk profile of individual borrowers, various segmentations (for example, geographic region, product type, industry segment), as well as the aggregate portfolio. We perform quarterly analyses of the consumer automotive, consumer mortgage, consumer other, and commercial portfolios using a range of indicators to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on historical and current trends. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAdditionally, we utilize numerous collection strategies to mitigate loss and provide ongoing support to customers in financial distress. For consumer automotive loans, we work with customers when they become delinquent on their monthly payment. In lieu of repossessing their vehicle, we may offer several types of assistance to aid our customers based on their willingness and ability to repay their loan. Loss mitigation may include payment extensions and rewrites of the loan terms. For mortgage loans, as part of certain programs, we offer mortgage loan modifications to qualified borrowers. These programs are in place to provide support to our mortgage customers in financial distress, including principal forgiveness, maturity extensions, delinquent interest capitalization, and changes to contractual interest rates.\nFurthermore, we manage our credit exposure to financial counterparties based on the risk profile of the counterparty. Within our policies we have established standards and requirements for managing counterparty risk exposures in a safe and sound manner. Counterparty credit risk is derived from multiple exposure types including derivatives, securities trading, securities financing transactions, financial futures, cash balances (for example, due from depository institutions, restricted accounts, and cash equivalents), and investment in debt securities. For more information on derivative counterparty credit risk, refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe employ an internal team of economists to enhance our planning and forecasting capabilities. This team conducts industry and market research, monitors economic risks, and helps support various forms of scenario planning. This group closely monitors macroeconomic trends given the nature of our business and the potential impacts on our exposure to credit risk. During 2019, the U.S. economy continued to modestly expand, led by consumer spending. The labor market remained robust during the year, with the unemployment rate at 3.5% as of December 31, 2019. Within the U.S. automotive market, new light vehicle sales have moderated from both historic highs and year-over-year pace, to a total of 17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect to experience modest downward pressure on used vehicle values during 2020.\nConsumer Credit Portfolio\nOur consumer loan portfolio primarily consists of automotive loans, first-lien mortgages, home equity loans and personal loans. Loan losses in our consumer loan portfolio are influenced by general business and economic conditions including unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings, and home and used vehicle prices. Additionally, our consumer credit exposure is significantly concentrated in automotive lending.\nCredit risk management for the consumer loan portfolio begins with the initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit life cycle. We manage consumer credit risk through our loan origination and underwriting policies and the credit approval process. We use proprietary credit-scoring models to differentiate the expected default rates of credit applicants enabling us to better evaluate credit applications for approval and to tailor the pricing and financing structure according to this assessment of credit risk. We continuously monitor and routinely update the inputs of the credit scoring models. These and other actions mitigate but do not eliminate credit risk. Ineffective evaluations of a borrower's creditworthiness, fraud, or changes in the applicant's financial condition after approval could negatively affect the quality of our portfolio, resulting in loan losses.\nOur servicing activities are another important factor in managing consumer credit risk. Servicing activities consist of collecting and processing customer payments, responding to customer concerns and inquiries, processing customer requests (including those for payoff quotes, total-loss handling, and payment modifications), maintaining a perfected security interest in the financed vehicle, engaging in collections activity, and disposing of off-lease and repossessed vehicles. Servicing activities are generally consistent across our Automotive Finance operations; however, certain practices may be influenced by state laws.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the credit performance of the consumer loan portfolio reflected our underwriting strategy to originate a diversified portfolio of consumer automotive loan assets, including new, used, prime and nonprime finance receivables and loans, as well as high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans that are acquired through bulk loan purchases and direct-to-consumer mortgage originations. We also further diversified our consumer portfolio to include personal lending through the acquisition of Health Credit Services during the fourth quarter of 2019. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses represented approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019, compared to approximately 11.7% at December 31, 2018.

Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting policies for finance receivables and loans. \n (c) Certain finance receivables and loans are included in fair value hedging relationships. Refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n (d) Includes outstanding CSG loans of $8.2 billion and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, and RV loans of $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. \n (e) Excludes $11 million of finance receivables at December 31, 2019, for which we have elected the fair value option.  Total consumer finance receivables and loans increased $2.7 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with December 31, 2018. The increase consists of $1.9 billion of consumer automotive finance receivables and loans, $621 million of consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans, and $201 million of consumer other finance receivables and loans. The increase in consumer automotive finance receivables and loans was primarily related to continued momentum in our used vehicle lending. The increase in consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans was primarily due to the execution of bulk loan purchases totaling $3.5 billion and direct-to-consumer held-for-investment originations of $2.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. These increases were partially offset by portfolio run-off and the transfer of $940 million of consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans to held-for-sale, of which $864 million were sold during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in consumer other finance receivables and loans was due to the acquisition of Health Credit Services during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nTotal consumer nonperforming finance receivables and loans at December 31, 2019, increased $78 million to $821 million from December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase of $98 million of consumer automotive finance receivables and loans and a decrease of $22 million of consumer mortgage nonperforming finance receivables and loans. The increase in nonperforming consumer automotive finance receivables and loans was primarily due to higher delinquency rates as part of our continued diversification strategy and as a result of portfolio growth. The increase was also modestly impacted by a brief scheduled moratorium on all collections and repossession activities at the end of 2019 prior to the conversion to a new servicing and accounting technology platform during the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in nonperforming consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans was driven by the continued run-off of our legacy mortgage portfolio. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Nonperforming consumer finance receivables and loans as a percentage of total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans were 0.9% at both December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018.\nTotal consumer TDRs outstanding at December 31, 2019, increased $20 million since December 31, 2018, to $746 million. Results reflect a $42 million increase in our consumer automotive loan portfolio, largely offset by a $22 million decrease in our consumer mortgage loan portfolio, driven by our legacy mortgage portfolio. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nConsumer automotive loans accruing and past due 30 days or more increased $115 million to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018, driven by growth in the overall size of the consumer automotive loan portfolio, as well as higher delinquency rates as part of our continued diversification strategy.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table includes consumer net charge-offs from finance receivables and loans at gross carrying value and related ratios.\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net charge-offs (recoveries)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net charge-off ratios (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer automotive\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Finance\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage - Legacy\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total consumer mortgage\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer other\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total consumer finance receivables and loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding finance receivables and loans excluding loans measured at fair value and loans held-for-sale during the period for each loan category.  Our net charge-offs from total consumer finance receivables and loans were $927 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $937 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by our consumer mortgage loan portfolio where we experienced strong credit performance as the legacy mortgage portfolio continues to run-off and we continue to grow our Mortgage Finance business. Net charge-offs for our consumer automotive portfolio increased slightly by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Results were primarily driven by the relatively consistent credit profile of our consumer automotive loan portfolio which experienced strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting and higher recoveries. Additionally, we experienced a modest reduction in net charge-offs due to a brief scheduled moratorium on all collections and repossession activities at the end of 2019 prior to the conversion to a new servicing and accounting technology platform during the first quarter of 2020.\nThe following table summarizes total consumer loan originations for the periods shown. Total consumer loan originations include loans classified as finance receivables and loans and loans held-for-sale during the period.\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer automotive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer mortgage (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>703\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer other (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total consumer loan originations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Excludes bulk loan purchases associated with our Mortgage Finance operations, and includes $738 million and $302 million of loans originated as held-for-sale for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. \n (b) Amounts relate to originations from our Ally Lending business, following the acquisition of Health Credit Services during the fourth quarter of 2019.  Total consumer loan originations increased $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase of $2.0 billion of consumer mortgage loans and an increase of $585 million of consumer automotive loans. The increase in consumer mortgage loan originations for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to growth in the direct-to-consumer mortgage business. The increase in consumer automotive loan originations for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to higher used vehicle volume.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table shows the percentage of consumer automotive and consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans by state concentration based on gross carrying value.

We monitor our consumer loan portfolio for concentration risk across the states in which we lend. The highest concentrations of consumer loans are in California and Texas, which represented an aggregate of 24.9% and 25.4% of our total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Our consumer mortgage loan portfolio concentration within California, which is primarily composed of high-quality jumbo mortgage loans, generally aligns to the California share of jumbo mortgages nationally.\nRepossessed and Foreclosed Assets\nWe classify an asset as repossessed or foreclosed, which is included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, when physical possession of the collateral is taken. We dispose of the acquired collateral in a timely fashion in accordance with regulatory requirements. For more information on repossessed and foreclosed assets, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRepossessed consumer automotive loan assets in our Automotive Finance operations increased $11 million from December 31, 2018, to $147 million at December 31, 2019. Foreclosed mortgage assets decreased $2 million from December 31, 2018, to $9 million at December 31, 2019.\nCommercial Credit Portfolio\nOur commercial portfolio consists primarily of automotive loans through the extension of wholesale floorplan financing, automotive dealer term real estate loans, and automotive fleet financing, as well as other commercial loans including our Corporate Finance lending portfolio. Wholesale floorplan loans are secured by the vehicles financed (and all other vehicle inventory), which provides strong collateral protection in the event of dealership default. Additional collateral (for example, a blanket lien over all dealership assets) or other credit enhancements (for example, personal guarantees from dealership owners) are typically obtained to further mitigate credit risk. Furthermore, in some cases, we may benefit from situations where an automotive manufacturer repurchases vehicles. These repurchases may serve as an additional layer of protection in the event of repossession of new-vehicle dealership inventory or dealership franchise termination.\nWithin our commercial portfolio, we utilize proprietary risk rating models that are fundamental to managing credit risk exposure consistently across various types of commercial borrowers and captures critical risk factors for each borrower. The ratings are used for many areas of credit risk management, including loan origination, portfolio risk monitoring, management reporting, and loan loss reserves analyses. Therefore, the rating systems are critical to an effective and consistent credit-risk-management framework.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the credit performance of the commercial portfolio remained strong as nonperforming finance receivables and loans decreased, and our net charge-offs remained low. For information on our commercial credit risk practices and policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, and charge-offs, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table includes total commercial finance receivables and loans reported at gross carrying value.\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Nonperforming (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Accruing past due 90 days or more (b)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (c)\n</td> <td>5,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>4,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial finance receivables and loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes nonaccrual TDR loans of $114 million and $86 million at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. \n (b) Loans are generally in nonaccrual status when principal or interest has been delinquent for 90 days or more, or when full collection is not expected. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting policies for finance receivables and loans. \n (c) Other commercial and industrial primarily includes senior secured commercial lending largely associated with our Corporate Finance operations.  Total commercial finance receivables and loans outstanding decreased $4.4 billion from December 31, 2018, to $38.3 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of GM dealer relationships due to the competitive environment across the automotive lending market and reduced dealer inventory levels. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Corporate Finance portfolio that was primarily driven by asset-based lending, including our lender finance vertical, which provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct lending activities.\nTotal commercial nonperforming finance receivables and loans were $215 million at December 31, 2019, reflecting a decrease of $134 million when compared to December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to reduced exposure to one large automotive dealer group that was placed into default in the fourth quarter of 2018. Nonperforming commercial finance receivables and loans as a percentage of outstanding commercial finance receivables and loans decreased to 0.6% at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.8% at December 31, 2018.\nTotal commercial TDRs outstanding at December 31, 2019, increased $35 million since December 31, 2018, to $121 million, reflecting an increase of $20 million in our Corporate Finance portfolio and an increase of $15 million in our commercial automotive portfolio. The increase in our Corporate Finance portfolio was primarily driven by three accounts being classified as TDRs, partially offset by the partial liquidation and charge-off of two accounts. The increase in our commercial automotive portfolio was primarily driven by TDRs involving one large automotive dealer group that was placed into default in the fourth quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe following table includes total commercial net charge-offs from finance receivables and loans at gross carrying value and related ratios.\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net charge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net charge-off ratios (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial finance receivables and loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding finance receivables and loans excluding loans measured at fair value and loans held-for-sale during the period for each loan category.  Our net charge-offs from total commercial finance receivables and loans were $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net charge-offs of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by partial charge-offs of four exposures within our Corporate Finance portfolio, as well as three accounts within our commercial automotive portfolio. Charge-off activity during 2019 was in line with expectations for these businesses.\nCommercial Real Estate\nThe commercial real estate portfolio consists of finance receivables and loans issued primarily to automotive dealers. Commercial real estate finance receivables and loans were $5.0 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the percentage of total commercial real estate finance receivables and loans by state concentration based on gross carrying value.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31,\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Texas\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Florida\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Michigan\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>California\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New York\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North Carolina\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Georgia\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New Jersey\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South Carolina\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Illinois\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other United States\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial real estate finance receivables and loans\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommercial Criticized Exposure\nFinance receivables and loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful are reported as criticized. These classifications are based on regulatory definitions and generally represent finance receivables and loans within our portfolio that have a higher default risk or have already defaulted. These finance receivables and loans require additional monitoring and review including specific actions to mitigate our potential loss.\nTotal criticized exposures increased $251 million from December 31, 2018, to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the downgrade of two dealership groups in December.\nThe following table presents the percentage of total commercial criticized finance receivables and loans by industry concentration based on gross carrying value.\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31,\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automotive\n</td> <td>81.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electronics\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial criticized finance receivables and loans\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelected Loan Maturity and Sensitivity Data\nThe table below shows the maturity of the commercial finance receivables and loans portfolio and the distribution between fixed and floating interest rates based on the stated terms of the commercial loan agreements.

The increase in our consumer automotive allowance was primarily driven by portfolio growth as finance receivable balances are up $1.9 billion compared to\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\n2018. The decrease in the consumer mortgage allowance was primarily driven by overall lower net charge-offs resulting from legacy mortgage portfolio run-off and strong credit performance, partially offset by year-over-year growth of $1.0 billion in our Mortgage Finance receivables portfolio.\nThe allowance for commercial loan losses declined $8 million at December 31, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in provision for loan losses was primarily driven by reserve\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nreductions during the year ended December 31, 2018, associated with hurricane activity experienced during 2017 in our consumer automotive loan portfolio. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting and higher recoveries. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2019, provision expense was incurred in our consumer other portfolio due to the acquisition of Health Credit Services. The provision for consumer mortgage loan losses increased $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by reserve releases for the year ended December 31, 2018, that did not repeat, partially offset by lower net charge-offs as the legacy mortgage portfolio continues to run-off. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance in our consumer mortgage portfolio.\nThe provision for commercial loan losses increased $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by our Corporate Finance portfolio which experienced higher reserves associated with favorable credit ratings migration in 2018 and portfolio growth, as well as a $6 million recovery of a previously charged-off loan recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018, that did not reoccur. Overall credit performance in the Corporate Finance portfolio remains stable.\nImplementation of CECL\nAlly will adopt CECL on January 1, 2020, as further described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon implementation of CECL we expect to recognize a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance of approximately $1.0 billion, net of income tax, which reflects a pre-tax increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $1.3 billion. This increase is almost exclusively driven by our consumer automotive loan portfolio. We plan to phase in the day-one impact of CECL into regulatory capital in accordance with regulatory capital rules which permit us to phase in 25% of the impact of CECL in 2020 and an additional 25% each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2023. We estimate that the implementation of CECL will reduce our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio by 17 to 19 basis points during the first quarter of 2020.\nUnder CECL, our modeling process will incorporate the following considerations:\n \u2022 A single forecast scenario for macroeconomic factors incorporated into the modeling process; \n \u2022 A 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over a 24-month period; \n \u2022 Data from the historical mean will be calculated from January 2008 through the most current period which includes data points from the most recent recessionary period.  Insurance/Underwriting Risk\nThe underwriting of our VSCs, VMCs, GAP, and insurance policies includes an assessment of the risk to determine acceptability and categorization for appropriate pricing. The acceptability of a particular risk is based on expected losses, expenses and other factors specific to the product in question. With respect to VSCs, considerations include the quality of the vehicles produced, the price of replacement parts, repair labor rates, and new model introductions. Insurance risk also includes event risk, which is synonymous with pure risk, hazard risk, or insurance risk, and presents no chance of gain, only of loss.\nWe mitigate losses by the active management of claim settlement activities using experienced claims personnel and the evaluation of current period reported claims. Losses for these events may be compared to prior claims experience, expected claims, or loss expenses from similar incidents to assess the reasonableness of incurred losses.\nIn some instances, reinsurance is used to reduce the risk associated with volatile business lines, such as catastrophe risk in vehicle inventory insurance. Our vehicle inventory insurance product is covered by excess-of-loss protection, including catastrophe coverage for weather-related events. In addition, loss control techniques such as storm path monitoring to assist dealers in preparing for severe weather help to mitigate loss potential.\nIn accordance with industry and accounting practices and applicable insurance laws and regulatory requirements, we maintain reserves for reported losses, losses incurred but not reported, losses expected to be incurred in the future for contracts in force and loss adjustment expenses. The estimated values of our prior reported loss reserves and changes to the estimated values are routinely monitored by credentialed actuaries. Our reserve estimates are regularly reviewed by management; however, since the reserves are based on estimates and numerous assumptions, the ultimate liability may differ from the amount estimated.\nMarket Risk\nOur financing, investing, and insurance activities give rise to market risk, or the potential change in the value of our assets (including securities, assets held-for-sale, loans and operating leases) and liabilities (including deposits and debt) due to movements in market variables such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign-exchange rates, equity prices, and off-lease vehicle prices.\nThe impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on our assets and liabilities (interest rate risk) represents an exposure to market risk. We primarily use interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate risk exposure.\nThe fair value of our credit-sensitive assets is also exposed to credit spread risk. Credit spread is the amount of additional return over the benchmark interest rates that an investor would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. Generally, an increase in credit spreads would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nWe are also exposed to foreign-currency risk arising from foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily in Canada. We enter into hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk.\nWe also have exposure to changes in the value of equity securities. We have exposure to equity securities with readily determinable fair values primarily related to our Insurance operations. For such equity securities, we use equity derivatives to manage our exposure to equity price fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed to changes in the value of other equity investments without readily determinable fair market values. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We may experience changes in the valuation of these investments, which may cause volatility in our earnings.\nThe composition of our balance sheet, including shorter-duration consumer automotive loans and variable-rate commercial loans, coupled with the continued funding shift toward retail deposits, partially mitigates market risk. Additionally, we maintain risk-management controls that measure and monitor market risk using a variety of analytical techniques including market value, sensitivity analysis, and value at risk models. Refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLIBOR Transition\nIn July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intent to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of LIBOR, it is expected that a transition away from the use of LIBOR to alternative benchmark rates will occur by the end of 2021.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR or LIBOR-based rates will present risks to our business, as further described in the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report. In recognition of these risks and uncertainties, we have established an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks that may arise from the potential discontinuation of LIBOR. Our program spans across impacted business lines and functions to evaluate risks associated with the transition, while taking into account specific considerations related to our customers, products and instruments, and counterparty exposures. Through this program, we continue to assess and plan for potential impacts to our existing and future contracts with customers and counterparties, financial forecasts, operational processes, technology, modeling, and vendor relationships. We also continue to evaluate effective communication strategies to employ with our stakeholders, including relevant customers, counterparties, and vendors.\nWe have exposure to LIBOR-based contracts within certain of our finance receivables and loans, primarily related to commercial automotive loans, corporate finance loans, and mortgage loans, as well as certain investment securities and derivative contracts, among other arrangements. Our commercial automotive loan portfolio is primarily composed of wholesale floorplan financing to automotive dealers. Currently, a significant portion of our wholesale floorplan finance receivables are invoiced utilizing a LIBOR-based reference rate and, as such, represents our largest exposure to LIBOR based on notional dollar amount. Smaller loan portfolios that utilize contracts containing LIBOR-based reference rates include our corporate finance held-for-investment loans and lending commitments, and our adjustable-rate mortgage loans. With respect to our liabilities, we have issued trust preferred securities with an interest rate linked to LIBOR and also have secured facilities, certain asset-backed securitizations, and brokered certificates of deposit that also contain LIBOR-based reference rates.\nWith respect to selecting an alternative benchmark, we continue to evaluate the most appropriate course of action for each instrument that currently references LIBOR as well as any future instruments that reference a benchmark. For example, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a group convened by the FRB, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed purchase transactions. We are evaluating SOFR, among other alternatives and actions, as a potential alternative reference rate to LIBOR, and are taking steps to assess the operational, financial, and various other impacts this change could have to our business. Additionally, we continue to evaluate inclusion of appropriate fallback provisions to our contracts to adequately address alternatives in the absence of LIBOR, including evaluating the fallback language proposed by the ARRC for certain contracts. We will continue to actively monitor industry developments and their potential impact to us.\nWe are also actively assessing how the discontinuation of LIBOR could impact accounting and financial reporting including, but not limited to, potential impacts to our hedge accounting, valuation or modeling, or impacts associated with modifying the terms of our loan agreements or debt instruments with our customers or counterparties. We also continue to monitor the activities of the standard setters such as the FASB, which has issued proposed guidance and new accounting standard updates that provide certain relief related to the transition away from LIBOR. For example, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes, which permits the use of the OIS rate based on the SOFR to be designated as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. In addition, the FASB has recently issued proposed guidance that would help ease the potential effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The proposed guidance would offer optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to modifications of certain contracts, hedging relationships, or other transactions that would be driven by reference rate reform. We anticipate this guidance will be issued as a final ASU in the first half of 2020.\nAlly recognizes the significance of LIBOR cessation, and has devoted numerous resources throughout all levels of the organization to actively identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with this transition. Our program is also subject to the governance and oversight of our Board through the RC and certain executive committees including the ALCO and the ERMC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nFair Value Sensitivity Analysis\nThe following table presents a fair value sensitivity analysis of our assets and liabilities using isolated hypothetical movements in specific market rates. The analysis assumes adverse instantaneous, parallel shifts in market-exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and equity prices. Additionally, since only adverse fair value impacts are included, the natural offset between asset and liability rate sensitivities that arise within a diversified balance sheet, such as ours, may not be considered.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial instruments exposed to changes in:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 10% adverse change in rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign-currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 10% adverse change in rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>810\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of 10% decrease in prices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Refer to the section below titled Net Financing Revenue Sensitivity Analysis for information on the interest rate sensitivity of our financial instruments.  Net Financing Revenue Sensitivity Analysis\nInterest rate risk represents our most significant exposure to market risk. We actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings. We use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments.\nWe prepare forward-looking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth, asset/liability positioning, and interest rates based on the implied forward curve. The analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and non-contractual maturities. We continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing actions.\nSimulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast. The changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity. Our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets, liabilities, and off-balance-sheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities. Our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates.\nThe net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following 12 months. A number of alternative rate scenarios are tested, including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve. Management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types. Relative to our baseline forecast, which is based on the implied forward curve, our net financing revenue over the next 12 months would increase by $13 million if interest rates remain unchanged.\nThe following table presents the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net financing revenue over the next 12 months assuming 100 basis point and 200 basis point instantaneous parallel and gradual parallel shock increases, and assuming 100 basis point instantaneous parallel and gradual parallel shock decreases to the implied market forward curve as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018.\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gradual (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Instantaneous\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gradual (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Instantaneous\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over 12 months.  The implied forward rate curve was lower across all tenors compared to December 31, 2018, and includes one projected rate cut in the federal funds target rate in the forecast horizon. The impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections. As of December 31, 2019, our net interest income sensitivity in the +100 and +200 basis point instantaneous shock scenarios has primarily been impacted by a net decrease in pay-fixed interest rate swaps, partially offset by funding sources shifting from short-term market-based funding to deposits.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario has decreased as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to the lower pay-fixed interest rate swap notional referenced above as well as the addition of interest rate floor contracts, partially offset by increased mortgage prepayment risk in a lower interest rate environment.\nOur risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate debt instruments, and pay-fixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floating-rate debt instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we initiated a hedging program of interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floating-rate assets. The size, maturity, and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet, ALM objectives, and interest rate environment evolve over time.\nOperating Lease Residual Risk Management\nWe are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio. This operating lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be lower than the projection of these values used in establishing the pricing at lease inception. However, certain automotive manufacturers have provided their guarantee for portions of our residual exposure, as further described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operating lease portfolio, net of accumulated depreciation was $8.9 billion and $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. The expected lease residual value of our operating lease portfolio at scheduled termination was $7.2 billion and $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. For information on our valuation of automotive operating lease residuals including periodic revisions through adjustments to depreciation expense based on current and forecasted market conditions, refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates-Valuation of Automotive Operating Lease Assets and Residuals within this MD&A.\n \u2022 Priced residual value projections - At contract inception, we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle. This evaluation uses a proprietary model, which includes variables such as age, expected mileage, seasonality, segment factors, vehicle type, economic indicators, production cycle, automotive manufacturer incentives, and unanticipated shifts in used vehicle supply, as well as expert judgment. This internally generated data is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. Periodically, we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense over the remaining life of the contract as necessary. At termination, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense. \n \u2022 Remarketing abilities - Our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and the proceeds realized from vehicle sales. Vehicles can be remarketed through auction (internet and physical), sale to dealer, sale to lessee, and other methods. The results within these channels vary, with physical auction typically resulting in the lowest-priced outcome. \n \u2022 Manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs - Automotive manufacturers influence operating lease residual results in the following ways: \n \u25e6 The brand image of automotive manufacturers and consumer demand for their products affects residual risk. \n \u25e6 Automotive manufacturer marketing programs may influence the used vehicle market for those vehicles through programs such as incentives on new vehicles, programs designed to encourage lessees to terminate their operating leases early in conjunction with the acquisition of a new vehicle (referred to as pull-ahead programs), and special rate used vehicle programs. \n \u2022 Used vehicle market - We have exposure to changes in used vehicle prices. General economic conditions, used vehicle supply and demand, and new vehicle market prices heavily influence used vehicle prices.  Operating Lease Vehicle Terminations and Remarketing\nThe following table summarizes the volume of operating lease terminations and average gain per vehicle, as well as our methods of vehicle sales at lease termination, stated as a percentage of total operating lease vehicle disposals.\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-lease vehicles terminated (in units)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average gain per vehicle ($ per unit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>462\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Method of vehicle sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Auction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Physical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sale to dealer, lessee, and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognized an average gain per vehicle of $607 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $661 for 2018. The decrease in average gain per vehicle for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to a decline in used vehicle values\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nresulting from increased market supply, most notably during the fourth quarter of 2019. The number of off-lease vehicles remarketed during the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased 16% compared to 2018. The decrease in remarketing volume for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to the wind down of our legacy GM operating lease portfolio. We expect future termination volume to be more consistent with trends experienced during the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information on our investment in operating leases, refer to Note 1 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating Lease Portfolio Mix\nWe monitor the concentration of our outstanding operating leases.

It is the risk resulting from the pursuit of business activities that turn out to be unsuccessful due to a variety of both controllable and non-controllable factors. We aim to mitigate this risk within our business lines through portfolio diversification, product innovations, close monitoring of the execution of our strategic and capital plan, and ensuring flexibility of the cost base.\nAlly's strategic plan is reviewed and approved annually by our Board, as are the capital plan and financial business plan. With oversight by our Board, executive management seeks to consistently apply core operating principles while executing our strategic plan within the risk appetite approved by the RC. The executive management team continuously monitors business performance throughout the year to assess strategic risk and find early warning signals so that risks can be proactively managed. Executive management regularly reviews actual performance versus the plan, updates our Board via reporting routines, and implements changes as deemed appropriate.\nSignificant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and recovery and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by our Board as required. At the business level, as we introduce new products, we monitor their performance relative to expectations. With oversight by our Board, executive management evaluates changes to the financial forecast and risk, capital, and liquidity positions throughout the year.\nReputation Risk\nReputation risk is the risk arising from negative public opinion on our business practices, whether true or not, that could cause a decline in the customer base, litigation, or revenue reductions. Reputation risk may result from many of our activities, including those related to the management of our business/strategic, operational, and credit risks. We manage reputation risk through established policies and controls in our businesses and risk-management processes to mitigate reputation risks in a timely manner and through proactive monitoring and identification of potential reputation risk events. We have established processes and procedures to respond to events that give rise to reputation risk, including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion, external communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and informing key stakeholders of potential reputation risks. Primary responsibility for the identification, escalation, and resolution of reputation risk issues resides with our business lines. Each employee has an obligation, within the scope of their activities, to analyze and assess any imminent or intended transaction in terms of possible risk factors in order to minimize reputation risks. Further, Ally's strong LEAD\u201d culture and distinct Do it Right\u201d philosophy also strengthen our efforts to mitigate reputational risks by promoting a transparent culture where every associate is expected to act as a risk manager. Our culture is proactive with our core principles embedded at all levels of the organization so that any associate, at any time, can and should call attention to risks that need to be addressed and taken into account. Our organization and governance structures provide oversight of reputation risks, and key risk indicators are reported regularly and directly to management and the RC, which provide primary oversight of reputation risk.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss or harm arising from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors, or external events. Operational risk is an inherent risk element in all of our activities. Such risk can manifest in various ways, including errors, business interruptions, and inappropriate behavior of employees, and can potentially result in financial losses and other damage to us. Operational risk includes business disruption risk, fraud risk, human capital risk, legal risk, model risk, process execution and management risk, and supplier (third party) risk.\n \u2022 Business disruption risk - The risk of significant disruption to our operations resulting from natural disasters, external technology outages, or other external events. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\n \u2022 Fraud risk - The risk from deliberate misrepresentation or concealment of information material to a transaction with the intent to deceive another and that is reasonably relied on or used in decision making. Fraud can occur internally (for example, employees) or externally (for example, criminal activity, third-party suppliers). \n \u2022 Human capital risk - The risk caused by high turnover, inadequate or improper staffing levels, departure/unavailability of key personnel, or inadequate training and includes our exposure to worker's compensation and employment litigation. \n \u2022 Legal risk - The risk arising from the potential that unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments can disrupt or otherwise negatively affect our operations or condition. \n \u2022 Model risk - The potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model assumptions, inputs, outputs, and reports. This risk may include fundamental errors within the model that produce inaccurate outputs or that the model is used incorrectly or inappropriately. \n \u2022 Process execution and management risk - The risk caused by failure to execute or adhere to policies, standards, procedures, processes, controls, and activities as designed and documented. \n \u2022 Supplier (third party) risk - The risk associated with third-party suppliers and their delivery of products or services and effect on overall business performance. This includes a supplier's failure to comply with information technology requirements, information and physical security, laws, rules, regulations, and legal agreements.  To monitor and mitigate such risk, we maintain a system of policies and a control framework designed to provide a sound and well-controlled operational environment. This framework employs practices and tools designed to maintain risk identification, risk governance, risk and control assessment and testing, risk monitoring, and transparency through risk reporting mechanisms. The goal is to maintain operational risk at appropriate levels based on our financial strength, the characteristics of the businesses and the markets in which we operate, and the related competitive and regulatory environment.\nInformation Technology/Security Risk\nInformation technology/security risk includes risk resulting from the failure of, or insufficiency in, information technology (for example, a system outage) or intentional or accidental unauthorized access, sharing, removal, tampering, or disposal of company and customer data or records.\nWe and our service providers rely extensively on communications, data-management, and other operating systems and infrastructure to conduct our business and operations. Failures or disruptions to these systems or infrastructure from cyberattacks or other events may impede our ability to conduct business and operations and may result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, or other harm.\nWe and other financial institutions continue to be the target of various cyberattacks, including through the introduction of malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service, or other security breaches, as part of an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions or obtain confidential, proprietary, or other information or assets of the Company, our customers, employees, or other third parties with whom we transact.\nCybersecurity and the continued development of our controls, processes, and systems to protect our technology infrastructure, customer information, and other proprietary information or assets remain a critical and ongoing priority. We recognize that cyber-related risks continue to evolve and have become increasingly sophisticated, and as a result we continuously evaluate the adequacy of our preventive and detective measures.\nIn order to help mitigate cybersecurity risks, we devote substantial resources to protect the Company from cyber-related incidents. We regularly assess vulnerabilities and threats to our environment utilizing various resources including independent third-party assessments to evaluate whether our layered system of controls effectively mitigates risk. We also invest in new technologies and infrastructure in order to respond to evolving risks within our environment. We continue to partner with other industry peers in order to share knowledge and information to further our security environment and invest in training and employee awareness to cyber-related risks. Additionally, as a further protective measure, we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to terms and conditions, may cover certain aspects of cybersecurity and information risks; however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses. Management monitors operational metrics and data surrounding cybersecurity operations, and the organization monitors compliance with established limits in connection with our risk appetite. Senior leadership regularly reviews, questions, and challenges such information.\nThe RC reviews cybersecurity risks, incidents, and developments in connection with its oversight of our independent risk-management program. Our Board and the AC also undertake reviews as appropriate. The Information Technology Risk Committee is responsible for supporting the Chief Risk Officer's oversight of Ally's management of cybersecurity and other risks involving our communications, data-management, and other operating systems and infrastructure. Additionally, our cybersecurity program is regularly assessed by Audit Services, which reports directly to the AC. The business lines are also actively engaged in overseeing the service providers that supply or support the operating systems and infrastructure on which we depend and, with effective challenge from the independent risk-management function, managing related operational and other risks.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nNotwithstanding these risk and control initiatives, we may incur losses attributable to information technology/security risk from time to time, and there can be no assurance these losses will not be incurred in the future or will not be substantial. For further information on cybersecurity, technology, systems, and infrastructure, refer to the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we implemented a new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases that is utilized for customer servicing and financial reporting through the full lifecycle of these loans and leases. This new platform replaces our existing consumer automotive loan and lease technology platform and helps modernize our technology, enhance the flexibility and capabilities of the platform, and streamline aspects of our servicing operations. While this new platform will help us continue to expand our capabilities, there are inherent risks in implementing any new system such as this. We will continue to monitor the newly implemented platform to ensure the system is performing as expected.\nCompliance Risk\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to the banking organization (applicable rules and standards). Examples of such risks include compliance with regulations set forth by banking agencies including fair and responsible banking, anti-money laundering, or community reinvestment act, risks associated with offering our products or services, or risks associated with deviating from internal policies and procedures including those that are established to promote sound risk-management and internal-control practices. Compliance risk also includes fiduciary risk, which includes risks arising from our duty to exercise loyalty, act in the best interest of our clients, and care for assets according to an appropriate standard of care. This risk generally exists to the extent that we exercise discretion in managing assets on behalf of a customer.\nWe recognize that an effective compliance program, including driving a culture of compliance, plays a key role in managing and overseeing compliance risk, and that a proactive compliance environment and program are essential to help meet various legal, regulatory, or other requirements or expectations. To manage compliance risk, we maintain a system of policies, change-management protocols, control frameworks, and other formal governance structures designed to provide a holistic enterprise approach to managing such risks, which includes consideration of identifying, assessing, monitoring, and communicating compliance risks throughout the Company. Our compliance function provides independent, enterprise-wide oversight of compliance-risk exposures and related risk-management practices and is led by the Chief Compliance Officer who reports to our Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Compliance Officer has the authority and responsibility for the oversight and administration of our Enterprise Compliance Program, which includes ongoing reporting of significant compliance-related matters to our Board and various committees established to govern compliance-related risks. The Compliance Risk Management Committee, established by the Chief Compliance Officer, serves to facilitate compliance risk management and to oversee the implementation of Ally's compliance risk-management strategies and covers compliance matters across the enterprise including matters impacting customers, products, geographies, and services.\nConduct Risk\nConduct risk is the risk of customer harm, employee harm, reputational damage, regulatory sanction, or financial loss resulting from the behavior of our employees and contractors toward customers, counterparties, other employees and contractors, or the markets in which we operate.\nBusiness lines are responsible for driving a culture consistent with our LEAD\u201d core values and Do it Right\u201d philosophy (otherwise known as the Tone from the Top\u201d). Ally maintains an enterprise-wide Conduct Risk Management program that establishes the requirements, standards, and processes to manage conduct risk.\nWe manage conduct risk through a variety of enterprise programs, policies, and procedures. Associates complete required training at on-boarding, and annually thereafter, to affirm their compliance with our Code of Conduct and Ethics. Training programs and other resources set expectations surrounding appropriate conduct, and behavior, and a culture of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies, and standards. Officers and employees are expected to take personal responsibility for maintaining the highest standards of honesty, trustworthiness, and ethical behavior; to understand and manage the risks associated with their positions; and to escalate concerns about risk management (including reporting of potential violations of the Code of Conduct and Ethics, our policies, or other laws and regulations). Conduct risk is considered through various human resources and management activities including associate recruiting, on-boarding, performance management, incentive programs and compensation, and corrective action. Oversight of conduct risk is performed by Enterprise Risk Management.\nEmployee engagement surveys and risk culture surveys provide valuable insight into employee views and opinions about the company's culture and conduct. The Ethics Hotline (independently managed, available to associates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) and Open-Door Process provide avenues for employees to report concerns or incidents of potential misconduct. Human Resources, Employee Relations, and Enterprise Fraud, Security, and Investigations have established processes and procedures for investigating and addressing cases of potential fraud or employee misconduct.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nLiquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital\nOverview\nThe purpose of liquidity management is to enable us to meet loan and operating lease demand, debt maturities, deposit withdrawals, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions as well as periods of economic or financial stress. Our primary objective is to maintain cost-effective, stable and diverse sources of funding capable of sustaining the organization throughout all market cycles. Sources of funding include both retail and brokered deposits and secured and unsecured market-based funding across various maturity, interest rate, and investor profiles. Additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities, committed secured credit facilities, repurchase agreements, and advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh.\nWe define liquidity risk as the risk that an institution's financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions. Liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institution-specific or market-related events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization. Effective management of liquidity risk positions an organization to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events. Managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions.\nThe Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO), chaired by the Corporate Treasurer, is responsible for overseeing our funding and liquidity strategies. Corporate Treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within limits approved by ALCO and the RC. As part of managing liquidity risk, Corporate Treasury prepares periodic forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds, executes our funding strategies, and manages liquidity under normal as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments. Oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk are provided by Independent Risk Management.\nFunding Strategy\nLiquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and cost-effective access to retail deposits and funding in various segments of the capital markets. We focus on maintaining diversified funding sources across a broad base of depositors, lenders, and investors to meet liquidity needs throughout different economic cycles, including periods of financial distress. These funding sources include retail and brokered deposits, committed secured credit facilities, public and private asset-backed securitizations, unsecured debt, FHLB advances, whole-loan sales, demand notes, and repurchase agreements. Our access to diversified funding sources enhances funding flexibility and results in a more cost-effective funding strategy over the long term. We evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles.\nWe manage our funding to achieve a well-balanced portfolio across a spectrum of risk, maturity, and cost-of-funds characteristics. Optimizing funding at Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our long-term liquidity strategy. We optimize our funding sources at Ally Bank by growing retail deposits, maintaining active public and private securitization programs, managing a prudent maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio, utilizing repurchase agreements, and continuing to access funds from the FHLB.\nEssentially all asset originations are directed to Ally Bank to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements, and to utilize our growing consumer deposit-taking capabilities. This allows us to use bank funding for an increasing proportion of our automotive finance and other assets and to provide a sustainable long-term funding channel for the business, while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nMultiple metrics are used to measure liquidity risk, manage the liquidity position, identify related trends, and monitor such trends and metrics against established limits. These metrics include coverage ratios and comprehensive stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio over stressed horizons ranging from overnight to 12 months, stability ratios that measure longer-term structural liquidity, and concentration ratios that enable prudent funding diversification. In addition, we have established internal management routines designed to review all aspects of liquidity and funding plans, evaluate the adequacy of liquidity buffers, review stress testing results, and assist management in the execution of its funding strategy and risk-management accountabilities.\nDuring October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized revisions to its regulatory framework which tailor regulatory requirements based on a banking organization's asset size and other supplementary measures, as further discussed in the section titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item I, of this report. Those revisions exempt Ally from complying with the LCR and LCR Disclosure Requirements and Ally ceased publication of this disclosure effective December 31, 2019. We do not anticipate a material change to Ally's funding and liquidity position as a result of the changes to the LCR requirement.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOur liquidity stress testing is designed to allow us to operate our businesses and to meet our contractual and contingent obligations, including unsecured debt maturities, for at least 12 months, assuming our normal access to funding is disrupted by severe market-wide and enterprise-specific events. We maintain available liquidity in the form of cash, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and available committed secured credit facility capacity. This available liquidity is held at various legal entities, taking into consideration regulatory restrictions and tax implications that may limit our ability to transfer funds across entities. The following table summarizes our total available liquidity.\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unencumbered highly liquid U.S. federal government and U.S. agency securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquid cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Committed secured credit facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused capacity (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total available liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Funding from committed secured credit facilities is available on request in the event excess collateral resides in certain facilities or the extent incremental collateral is available and contributed to the facilities.  Recent Funding Developments\nDuring 2019, we accessed the public and private markets to execute secured funding transactions, an unsecured funding transaction, and to manage our committed secured credit facility capacity. Key funding highlights from January 1, 2019, to date were as follows:\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we raised $3.6 billion through securitizations backed by consumer automotive loans. \n \u2022 In May 2019, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised $750 million through the issuance of senior notes. \n \u2022 Our total capacity in committed secured credit facilities was reduced by $6.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, as we continue to shift our overall funding toward a greater mix of cost-effective deposit funding.

These retail deposits provide our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, Corporate Finance operations and Ally Lending with a stable and low-cost funding source. Retail deposits are a key driver of funding cost optimization and reducing reliance on capital markets-based funding. We believe retail deposits are less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility, or changes in credit ratings when compared to other funding sources. We have continued to expand our deposit gathering efforts through both direct and indirect marketing channels. Current retail deposit offerings consist of a variety of products including CDs, savings accounts, money-market accounts, IRA deposit products, as well as an interest checking product. In addition, we utilize brokered deposits, which are obtained through third-party intermediaries, including a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table shows Ally Bank's number of accounts and deposit balances as of the end of each quarter since 2018.\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>4th quarter 2019\n</td> <td>3rd quarter 2019\n</td> <td>2nd quarter 2019\n</td> <td>1st quarter 2019\n</td> <td>4th quarter 2018\n</td> <td>3rd quarter 2018\n</td> <td>2nd quarter 2018\n</td> <td>1st quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of retail bank accounts (in thousands)\n</td> <td>4,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokered (a)\n</td> <td>16,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (b)\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Brokered deposit balances include a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances deposited at Ally Bank by a third party of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2019, $1.1 billion as September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, and $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2018, June 30, 2018, and March 31, 2018. \n (b) Other deposits include mortgage escrow and other deposits.  During 2019, our total deposit base grew $14.6 billion and we added approximately 322 thousand retail deposit customers, resulting in 1.97 million total retail deposit customers as of December 31, 2019. The recent growth in total deposits has been primarily attributable to our retail deposit portfolio-particularly within our online savings product and retail CDs. Strong retention rates and customer acquisition, reflecting the strength of the brand, continue to drive growth in retail deposits. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of deposit funding by type.\nSecuritizations and Secured Financings\nIn addition to building a larger deposit base, securitizations and secured funding continue to be a reliable and cost-effective source of financing. Securitizations and secured funding transactions, collectively referred to as securitization transactions due to their similarities, allow us to convert our automotive finance receivables and operating leases into cash earlier than what would have occurred in the normal course of business, and we continue to remain active in the well-established securitization markets.\nAs part of these securitization transactions, we sell assets to various special purpose entities (SPEs) in exchange for the proceeds from the issuance of debt and other beneficial interests in the assets. The activities of the SPEs are generally limited to acquiring the assets, issuing and making payments on the debt, paying related expenses, and periodically reporting to investors.\nThese SPEs are separate legal entities that assume the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables they hold. The assets of the SPEs are not available to satisfy our claims or those of our creditors. In addition, the SPEs do not invest in our equity or in the equity of any of our affiliates. Our economic exposure related to the SPEs is generally limited to cash reserves, retained interests, and customary representation, warranty, and covenant provisions.\nWe typically agree to service the assets transferred in our securitization transactions for a fee, and we may be entitled to other related fees. The total amount of servicing fees earned is disclosed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We may also retain a portion of senior and subordinated interests issued by the SPEs. Subordinate interests typically provide credit support to the more highly rated senior interest in a securitization transaction and may be subject to all or a portion of the first-loss position related to the sold assets.\nCertain of these securitization transactions meet the criteria to be accounted for as off-balance-sheet securitization transactions if we do not hold a potentially significant economic interest or do not provide servicing or asset management functions for the financial assets held by the securitization entity. Certain of our securitization transactions do not meet the required criteria to be accounted for as off-balance-sheet securitization transactions; therefore, they are accounted for as secured borrowings. For information regarding our securitization activities, refer to Note 1 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2019, we raised $3.6 billion through the completion of term securitization transactions backed by consumer automotive loans. Additionally, for consumer automotive loans and operating leases, the term structure of the transaction locks in funding for a specified pool of loans and operating leases, creating an effective tool for managing interest rate and liquidity risk.\nWe manage securitization execution risk by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and available capacity from committed secured credit facilities provided by banks. Our ability to access the unused capacity in these facilities depends on the availability of eligible assets to collateralize the incremental funding and, in some instances, on the execution of interest rate hedges. We maintain bilateral facilities, which fund our Automotive Finance operations. The facilities can be revolving in nature-generally having an original tenor ranging from 364 days to two years and allowing for additional funding during the commitment period-or they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the commitment period. At December 31, 2019, all of our $2.5 billion of capacity was revolving and of this balance, $1.1 billion was from facilities with a remaining tenor greater than 364 days.\nWe also have access to funding through advances with the FHLB. These advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and investment securities. As of December 31, 2019, we had pledged $24.8 billion of assets to the FHLB resulting in $18.8 billion in total funding capacity with $16.3 billion of debt outstanding.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAt December 31, 2019, $46.2 billion of our total assets were restricted as collateral for the payment of debt obligations accounted for as secured borrowings and repurchase agreements. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nUnsecured Financings\nWe obtain unsecured funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes under our Demand Notes program. The holder has the option to require us to redeem these notes at any time without restriction. Demand Notes outstanding were $2.6 billion at December 31, 2019. We also have short-term and long-term unsecured debt outstanding from retail term note programs. These programs are composed of callable fixed-rate instruments with fixed-maturity dates and floating-rate notes. There were $271 million of retail term notes outstanding at December 31, 2019. The remainder of our unsecured debt is composed of institutional term debt. In May 2019, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised $750 million through the issuance of senior notes. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term unsecured debt.\nOther Secured and Unsecured Short-term Borrowings\nWe have access to repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. The securities sold in repurchase agreements include U.S. government and federal agency obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we had no debt outstanding under repurchase agreements.\nAdditionally, we have access to the FRB Discount Window and can borrow funds to meet short-term liquidity demands. However, the FRB is not a primary source of funding for day-to-day business. Instead, it is a liquidity source that can be accessed in stressed environments or periods of market disruption. We had assets pledged and restricted as collateral to the FRB totaling $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. We had no debt outstanding with the FRB as of December 31, 2019.\nCash Flows\nThe following summarizes the activity reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While this information may be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may not be as helpful when analyzing changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity, dividends, and ALM herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and related activity.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Activity was largely consistent year-over-year, as cash flows from our consumer and commercial lending activities remained relatively flat.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $14.5 billion for the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $9.7 billion net decrease in cash outflows from purchases, sales, originations and repayments of finance receivables and loans, as repayments outpaced originations. This decrease was also driven by a $835 million increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities, net proceeds from sales and repayments. This was partially offset by a $778 million increase in net outflows from purchases of operating lease assets, net of disposals.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $1.5 billion, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $10.7 billion for the same period in 2018. The change was primarily attributable to a $11.5 billion decrease in net cash inflows due to issuance of long-term debt and an increase in net cash outflows related to short-term borrowings of $3.0 billion between the two periods. This was partially offset by an increase of $1.7 billion from net cash inflows associated with deposits.\nCapital Planning and Stress Tests\nUnder the final rules implementing the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act), as further described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are (1) made subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle rather than the previously required one-year cycle, (2) required to continue submitting an annual capital plan to the FRB, (3) allowed to continue excluding accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital, (4) exempted from company-run capital stress testing, and (5) allowed to remain exempted from the supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer.\nOur annual capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on our capital. The plan must also include a discussion of how we, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with its risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, and will serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to the plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection. If the FRB objects to the plan, or if certain material events occur after submission of the plan, we must submit a revised plan to the FRB within 30 days. Even if the FRB does not object to the plan, we may be precluded from or limited in paying dividends or other capital distributions without the FRB's approval under certain circumstances-for example, when we would not meet minimum regulatory capital ratios and capital buffers after giving effect to the distributions.\nIn October 2019, the FRB noted its intent to propose changes to the capital-plan rule, including for the purpose of providing Category IV firms like us with additional flexibility in developing their annual capital plans. At this time, the impacts that such a potential future proposal may have on us are not clear.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents information related to our common stock and distributions to our common stockholders over the last eight quarters.\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Common stock repurchased during period (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash dividends declared per common share (b)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions, except per share data; shares in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Approximate dollar value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>End of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>437,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>425,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>425,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>399,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>399,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes shares of common stock withheld to cover income taxes owed by participants in our share-based incentive plans. \n (b) On January 13, 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share on all common stock, payable on February 14, 2020. Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this common stock dividend.  We received a non-objection to our 2018 capital plan in June 2018. We were not required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB, participate in the supervisory stress test or CCAR, or conduct company-run capital stress tests during the 2019 cycle. Instead, our capital actions during this cycle are largely based on the results from our 2018 supervisory stress test. On April 1, 2019, our Board authorized an increase in our stock-repurchase program, permitting us to repurchase up to $1.25 billion of our common stock from time to time from the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020, representing a 25% increase over our previously announced program. Additionally, on January 13, 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our common stock. Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the most recent dividend.\nOur ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, will continue to be subject to the FRB's review and internal governance requirements, including approval by our Board. The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases also will be subject to various factors, including Ally's capital and liquidity positions, regulatory considerations, any accounting standards that affect capital or liquidity (including CECL), financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, common-stock price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time.\nRegulatory Capital\nRefer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section titled Selected Financial Data within this MD&A.\nCredit Ratings\nThe cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by credit ratings, which are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation. Lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. This is particularly true for certain institutional investors whose investment guidelines require investment-grade ratings on term debt and the two highest rating categories for short-term debt (particularly money-market investors).\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nNationally recognized statistical rating organizations rate substantially all our debt. The following table summarizes our current ratings and outlook by the respective nationally recognized rating agencies.\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Short-term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior unsecured debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Date of last action\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>F3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 19, 2019 (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Not Prime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 19, 2019 (b)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 16, 2019 (c)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DBRS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>R-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB (Low)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Positive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 20, 2019 (d)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- from BB+, upgraded our short-term rating to from B, and changed the outlook to Stable from Positive on August 19, 2019. \n (b) Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to Ba1 from Ba2, affirmed our short-term rating of Not Prime, and maintained a Stable outlook on December 19, 2019. Effective December 1, 2014, we determined to not renew our contractual arrangement with Moody's related to their providing of our issuer, senior unsecured debt, and short-term ratings. Notwithstanding this, Moody's has determined to continue to provide these ratings on a discretionary basis. However, Moody's has no obligation to continue to provide these ratings, and could cease doing so at any time. \n (c) Standard & Poor's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- from BB+, upgraded our short-term rating to A-3 from B, and changed the outlook to Stable from Positive on October 16, 2019. \n (d) DBRS affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of BBB (Low), affirmed our short-term rating of R-3, and changed the outlook to Positive from Stable on May 20, 2019.  During 2019, both S&P and Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BB+ to BBB-, which is defined by both rating agencies as an investment grade credit rating. Following our announcement to acquire CardWorks on February 18, 2020, Fitch, Moody's, S&P, and DBRS affirmed our credit ratings for our short-term and senior unsecured debt, with each agency maintaining its respective outlook.\nRating agencies indicate that they base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, which may include capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current operating, legislative, and regulatory environment. Rating agencies themselves could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices-particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes. Potential changes in rating methodology, as well as in the legislative and regulatory environment, and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nA credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nInsurance Financial Strength Ratings\nSubstantially all of our Insurance operations have a Financial Strength Rating (FSR) and an Issuer Credit Rating (ICR) from the A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best). The FSR is intended to be an indicator of the ability of the insurance company to meet its senior most obligations to policyholders. Lower ratings generally result in fewer opportunities to write business, as insureds, particularly large commercial insureds, and insurance companies purchasing reinsurance have guidelines requiring high FSR ratings. On August 30, 2019, A.M. Best upgraded the FSR for Ally Insurance Group to A- (excellent) from B++ (good), and upgraded the ICR to a- from bbb+. The outlook was revised to Stable from Positive.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nRefer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGuarantees\nGuarantees are defined as contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to third parties based on changes in an underlying agreement that is related to a guaranteed party. Our guarantees include client securities to a clearing broker, standby letters of credit, and certain contract provisions associated with securitizations, sales, and divestitures. Refer to Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our outstanding guarantees to third parties.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nThe following table provides aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations disclosed elsewhere in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractually obligated payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Scheduled interest payments for fixed-rate long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments for variable-rate long-term debt (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated net payments under interest rate swap agreements (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease commitments (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank certificates of deposit (d) (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit liabilities without a stated maturity (e) (f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractually obligated payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other commitments by expiration period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lending commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Total long-term debt amount reflects the remaining principal obligation and excludes net original issue discount of $1.1 billion, unamortized debt issuance costs of $86 million, and a favorable hedge basis adjustment of $24 million related to fixed-rate debt previously designated as a hedged item. \n (b) Estimated using a forecasted variable interest model, when available, or the applicable variable interest rate as of the most recent reset date prior to December 31, 2019. For additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (c) Excludes a forward-starting lease agreement for a new corporate facility in Charlotte, North Carolina, scheduled to commence in April 2021. The lease agreement will have a total of $290 million in undiscounted future lease payments over the 15-year term of the lease. \n (d) Amounts presented exclude unamortized commissions paid to brokers. \n (e) Deposits exclude estimated interest payments. \n (f) Deposits without a stated maturity are payable on demand and include savings and money market checking, mortgage escrow, dealer, and other deposits; and are classified above as due in less than one year.  The foregoing table does not include our reserves for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, which total $122 million at December 31, 2019. While payments due on insurance losses are considered contractual obligations because they related to insurance policies issued by us, the ultimate amount to be paid and the timing of payment for an insurance loss is an estimate subject to significant uncertainty. Furthermore, the majority of the balance is expected to be paid out in less than five years.\nThe following provides a description of the items summarized in the preceding table of contractual obligations.\nLong-term Debt\nAmounts represent the scheduled maturity of long-term debt at December 31, 2019, assuming that no early redemptions occur. The maturity of secured debt may vary based on the payment activity of the related secured assets. The amounts presented are before the effect of any unamortized discount, debt issuance costs, or fair value adjustment. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt obligations. We primarily use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our secured and unsecured long-term debt portfolio. These derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. For additional information on derivatives, refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLease Commitments\nWe have obligations under various operating lease arrangements for real property with noncancelable lease terms that expire after December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nPurchase Obligations\nWe enter into multiple contractual arrangements for various services. The arrangements represent fixed payment obligations under our most significant contracts and primarily relate to contracts with information technology providers. Refer to Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nBank Certificates of Deposit\nRefer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nLending Commitments\nWe have outstanding lending commitments with customers. The amounts presented represent the unused portion of those commitments at December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nAccounting policies are integral to understanding our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions, on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; critical accounting estimates are described in this section. An accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to these estimates.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses (the allowance) to absorb probable loan credit losses inherent in the held-for-investment portfolio. The allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience in our lending portfolio. The allowance is management's estimate of incurred losses in our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment. Management performs quarterly analyses of these portfolios to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses. Additions to the allowance are charged to current period earnings through the provision for loan losses; amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance, while amounts recovered on previously charged-off accounts increase the allowance. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance requires management to exercise significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, including the timing, frequency, and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for loan losses and, therefore, net income. For additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes, refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While we attribute portions of the allowance across our lending portfolios, the entire allowance is available to absorb probable loan losses inherent in our total lending portfolio.\nThe consumer portfolio segments consist of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans within our Automotive Finance operations, Mortgage Finance operations, and consumer unsecured lending included within Corporate and Other. Excluding certain loans that are identified as individually impaired, the allowance for each consumer portfolio segment (automotive, mortgage, and other) is evaluated collectively. The allowance is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations that begin with estimates of incurred losses in each portfolio segment based on various statistical analyses for our automotive and mortgage portfolio segments, and a vintage analysis for our other portfolio segment. We leverage statistical models based on recent loss trends to develop a systematic incurred loss reserve. These statistical loss forecasting models are utilized to estimate incurred losses and consider several credit quality indicators including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, current economic conditions, credit scores, and expected loss factors by loan type. Management believes these factors are relevant to estimate incurred losses and are updated on a quarterly basis in order to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment, as changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact. In order to develop our best estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio, management reviews and analyzes the output from the models and may adjust the reserves to take into consideration environmental, qualitative, and other factors that may not be captured in the models. These adjustments are documented and reviewed through our risk management processes. Management reviews, updates, and validates its systematic process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis. This process involves an analysis of loss information, such as a review of loss and credit trends, a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts, and other analyses.\nThe commercial portfolio segment is primarily composed of larger-balance, nonhomogeneous exposures within our Automotive Finance operations and Corporate Finance operations. These loans are primarily evaluated individually and are risk-rated based on borrower, collateral, and industry-specific information that management believes is relevant in determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement based on current information and events. Management establishes specific allowances for commercial loans determined to be individually impaired based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loans' effective interest rate, and the observable market price or the fair value of collateral, whichever is determined to be the most appropriate. Estimated costs to sell the collateral on a discounted basis are included in the impairment measurement, when appropriate. In addition to the specific allowances for impaired loans, loans that are not identified as individually impaired are grouped into pools based on similar risk characteristics and collectively evaluated. These allowances are based on historical loss experience, concentrations, current economic conditions, performance trends within specific geographic locations, and other qualitative factors identified by management. The commercial historical loss experience is updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflective of the current economic environment.\nThe determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and many factors that may materially affect estimates of loss, including volatility of loss given default, probability of default, and rating migration. The critical assumptions underlying the allowance include: (i) segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics; (ii) identification and estimation of portfolio indicators and other factors that management believes are key to estimating incurred credit losses; and (iii) evaluation by management of borrower, collateral, and geographic information. Management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments as the assumptions in the\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nunderlying analyses change to reflect an estimate of incurred loan losses at the reporting date, based on the best information available at that time. In addition, the allowance related to the commercial portfolio segment could be influenced by situations in which automotive manufacturers may repurchase vehicles used as collateral to secure the loans in default situations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce earnings.\nValuation of Automotive Operating Lease Assets and Residuals\nWe have significant investments in vehicles in our operating lease portfolio. In accounting for operating leases, management must make a determination at the beginning of the operating lease contract of the estimated realizable value (i.e., residual value) of the vehicle at the end of the lease. Residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term. At contract inception, we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the vehicle. This evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model, which includes variables such as age, expected mileage, seasonality, segment factors, vehicle type, economic indicators, production cycle, automotive manufacturer incentives, and shifts in used vehicle supply. This internally generated data is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. The customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus rental charges. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception. Management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of operating lease assets.\nTo account for residual risk, we depreciate automotive operating lease assets to expected realizable value on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The estimated realizable value is initially based on the residual value established at contract inception. Periodically, we review the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions, and other relevant data points, and adjust depreciation expense as necessary over the remaining term of the lease. Impairment of operating lease assets is assessed upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Triggering events are systemic, observed events impacting the used vehicle market such as shocks to oil and gas prices that may indicate impairment of the operating lease asset. Impairment is determined to exist if the expected undiscounted cash flows generated from the operating lease assets are less than the carrying value of the operating lease assets. If the operating lease assets are impaired, they are written down to their fair value as estimated by discounted cash flows. There were no such impairment charges in 2019, 2018, or 2017.\nOur depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers management's expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination, which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values. The critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automotive operating lease assets include: (i) estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values, (ii) proper identification and estimation of business conditions, (iii) our remarketing abilities, and (iv) automotive manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the operating lease residual value. Expected residual values include estimates of payments from automotive manufacturers related to residual support and risk-sharing agreements, if any. To the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements, our depreciation expense would be negatively impacted.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Refer to Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models, and significant assumptions utilized. We follow the fair value hierarchy set forth in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in order to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value. We review and modify, as necessary, our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis, which can result in reclassifications between hierarchy levels.\nWe have numerous internal controls in place to address risks inherent in estimating fair value measurements. Significant fair value measurements are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval. We have an established risk management policy and model validation program. This model validation program establishes a controlled environment for the development, implementation, and operation of models used to generate fair value measurements and change procedures. Further, this program uses a risk-based approach to determine the frequency at which models are to be independently reviewed and validated. Additionally, a wide array of operational controls governs fair value measurements, including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurement models. For example, we backtest the internal assumptions used within models against actual performance. We also monitor the market for recent trades, market surveys, or other market information that may be used to benchmark model inputs or outputs. Certain valuations will also be benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available. We have scheduled model or input recalibrations that occur on a periodic basis but will recalibrate earlier if significant variances are observed as part of the backtesting or benchmarking noted above.\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions from market observable data used to estimate our Level 2 fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to our internal valuation models used to estimate our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayment speeds, credit losses, and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements and amounts that could be realized.\nDetermination of Provision for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes predominantly in the United States. Significant\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\njudgments and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss).\nAs of each reporting date, we consider existing evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. Following the sale of our legacy international operations in 2012 and 2013, we continue to hold unexpired foreign tax credits subject to a partial valuation allowance. We continue to believe it is more likely than not that the benefit for certain foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we continue to provide a partial valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets relating to these carryforwards and it is reasonably possible that the valuation allowance may change in the next 12 months.\nFor additional information regarding our provision for income taxes, refer to Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards.\nManagement's Discussion and

(together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, Ally, the Company, or we, us, or our) is a leading digital financial-services company. As a customer-centric company with passionate customer service and innovative financial solutions, we are relentlessly focused on Doing It Right\u201d and being a trusted financial-services provider to our consumer, commercial, and corporate customers. We are one of the largest full-service automotive finance operations in the country and offer a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and consumers. Our award-winning online bank (Ally Bank, Member FDIC and Equal Housing Lender) offers mortgage lending, personal lending, and a variety of deposit and other banking products, including savings, money-market, and checking accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Additionally, we offer\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nsecurities-brokerage and investment-advisory services through Ally Invest. Our robust corporate-finance business offers capital for equity sponsors and middle-market companies. We are a Delaware corporation and are registered as a bank holding company (BHC) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and a financial holding company (FHC) under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended.\nOur Business\nDealer Financial Services\nDealer Financial Services comprises our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments. Our primary customers are automotive dealers, which are independently owned businesses. A dealer may sell or lease a vehicle for cash but, more typically, enters into a retail installment sales contract or operating lease with the customer and then sells the retail installment sales contract or the operating lease and the leased vehicle, as applicable, to Ally or another automotive-finance provider. The purchase by Ally or another provider is commonly described as indirect automotive lending to the customer.\nOur Dealer Financial Services business is one of the largest full-service automotive finance operations in the country and offers a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and their customers. We have deep dealer relationships that have been built throughout our over 100-year history, and we are leveraging competitive strengths to expand our dealer footprint. Our dealer-centric business model encourages dealers to use our broad range of products through incentive programs like our Ally Dealer Rewards program, which rewards individual dealers based on the depth and breadth of our relationship. Our automotive finance services include purchasing retail installment sales contracts and operating leases from dealers, extending automotive loans directly to consumers, offering term loans to dealers, financing dealer floorplans and providing other lines of credit to dealers, supplying warehouse lines to automotive retailers, offering automotive-fleet financing, providing financing to companies and municipalities for the purchase or lease of vehicles, and supplying vehicle-remarketing services. We also offer retail VSCs and commercial insurance primarily covering dealers' vehicle inventories. We are a leading provider of VSCs, GAP, and vehicle maintenance contracts (VMCs).\nAutomotive Finance\nOur Automotive Finance operations provide U.S.-based automotive financing services to consumers, automotive dealers, other businesses, and municipalities. Our dealer-focused business model, value-added products and services, full-spectrum financing, and business expertise proven over many credit cycles make us a premier automotive finance company. At December 31, 2019, our Automotive Finance operations had $113.9 billion of assets and generated $4.4 billion of total net revenue in 2019. For consumers, we provide financing for new and used vehicles. In addition, our Commercial Services Group (CSG) provides automotive financing for small businesses. At December 31, 2019, our CSG had $8.2 billion of loans outstanding. Through our commercial automotive financing operations, we fund dealer purchases of new and used vehicles through wholesale floorplan financing. We manage commercial account servicing on approximately 3,300 dealers that utilize our floorplan inventory lending or other commercial loans. We service an $80.6 billion consumer loan and operating lease portfolio at December 31, 2019, and our commercial automotive loan portfolio was approximately $32.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The extensive infrastructure, technology, and analytics of our servicing operations as well as the experience of our servicing personnel enhance our ability to minimize our loan losses and enable us to deliver a favorable customer experience to both our dealers and retail customers. During 2019, we continued to reposition our origination profile to focus on capital optimization and risk-adjusted returns. In 2019, total consumer automotive originations were $36.3 billion, an increase of $898 million compared to 2018. The shorter-term duration consumer automotive loan and variable-rate commercial loan portfolios offer attractive asset classes where we continue to optimize risk-adjusted returns through origination mix management and pricing and underwriting discipline.\nOur success as an automotive finance provider is driven by the consistent and broad range of products and services we offer to dealers. The automotive marketplace is dynamic and evolving, and we are focused on meeting the needs of both our dealer and consumer customers and continuing to strengthen and expand upon the 18,300 dealer relationships we have. Clearlane, our online automotive lender exchange, expands our direct-to-consumer capabilities and provides a digital platform for consumers seeking financing. Clearlane further enhances our automotive financing offerings, dealer relationships, and digital capabilities. In addition to providing a digital direct-to-consumer channel for Ally, Clearlane is a fee-based business that generates revenue by successfully referring leads to other automotive lenders. Additionally, we continue to identify and cultivate relationships with automotive retailers including those with leading eCommerce platforms. We believe these actions will enable us to respond to the growing trends for a more streamlined and digital automotive financing process to serve both dealers and consumers.\nThe Growth channel was established to focus on developing dealer relationships beyond those relationships that primarily were developed through our role as a captive finance company for General Motors Company (GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC (Chrysler). The Growth channel was expanded to include direct-to-consumer financing through Clearlane and other channels and our arrangements with online automotive retailers. We have established relationships with thousands of Growth channel dealers through our customer-centric approach and specialized incentive programs designed to drive loyalty amongst dealers to our products and services. The success of the Growth channel has been a key enabler to converting our business model from a focused captive finance company to a leading market competitor. In this channel, we currently have over 11,800 dealer relationships, of which approximately 88% are franchised dealers (including brands such as Ford, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda, and others), or used vehicle only retailers with a national presence.\nOver the past several years, we have continued to focus on the consumer used vehicle segment primarily through franchised dealers, which has resulted in used vehicle financing volume growth, and has positioned us as an industry leader in used vehicle financing. The highly fragmented used vehicle financing market, with a total financing opportunity represented by over 279 million vehicles in operation, provides\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nan attractive opportunity that we believe will further expand and support our dealer relationships and increase our risk-adjusted return on retail loan originations.\nFor consumers, we provide automotive loan financing and leasing for new and used vehicles to approximately 4.5 million customers. Retail financing for the purchase of vehicles by individual consumers generally takes the form of installment sales financing. We originated a total of approximately 1.4 million automotive loans and operating leases during both the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, totaling $36.3 billion and $35.4 billion, respectively.\nOur consumer automotive financing operations generate revenue primarily through finance charges on retail installment sales contracts and rental payments on operating lease contracts. For operating leases, when the contract is originated, we estimate the residual value of the leased vehicle at lease termination. Periodically thereafter we revise the projected residual value of the leased vehicle at lease termination and adjust depreciation expense over the remaining life of the lease if appropriate. Given the fluctuations in used vehicle values, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the projected residual value, which results in gains or losses on lease termination. While all operating leases are exposed to potential reductions in used vehicle values, only loans where we take possession of the vehicle are affected by potential reductions in used vehicle values. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion of credit risk and lease residual risk.\nWe continue to maintain a diverse mix of product offerings across a broad risk spectrum, subject to underwriting policies that reflect our risk appetite. Our current operating results continue to increasingly reflect our ongoing strategy to grow used vehicle financing and expand risk-adjusted returns. While we predominately focus on prime-lending markets, we seek to be a meaningful source of financing to a wide spectrum of customers and continue to carefully measure risk versus return. We place great emphasis on our risk management and risk-based pricing policies and practices and employ robust credit decisioning processes coupled with granular pricing that is differentiated across our proprietary credit tiers.\nOur commercial automotive financing operations primarily fund dealer inventory purchases of new and used vehicles, commonly referred to as wholesale floorplan financing. This represents the largest portion of our commercial automotive financing business. Wholesale floorplan loans are secured by vehicles financed (and all other vehicle inventory), which provide strong collateral protection in the event of dealership default. Additional collateral or other credit enhancements (for example, personal guarantees from dealership owners) are typically obtained to further mitigate credit risk. The amount we advance to dealers is equal to 100% of the wholesale invoice price of new vehicles. Interest on wholesale automotive financing is generally payable monthly and is indexed to a floating-rate benchmark. The rate for a particular dealer is based on, among other considerations, competitive factors and the dealer's creditworthiness. During 2019, we financed an average of $28.2 billion of dealer vehicle inventory through wholesale floorplan financings. Other commercial automotive lending products, which averaged $5.7 billion during 2019, consist of automotive dealer revolving lines of credit, term loans, including those to finance dealership land and buildings, and dealer fleet financing. We also provide comprehensive automotive remarketing services, including the use of SmartAuction, our online auction platform, which efficiently supports dealer-to-dealer and other commercial wholesale vehicle transactions. SmartAuction provides diversified fee-based revenue and serves as a means of deepening relationships with our dealership customers. In 2019, Ally and other parties, including dealers, fleet rental companies, and financial institutions, utilized SmartAuction to sell approximately 270,000 vehicles to dealers and other commercial customers. SmartAuction served as the remarketing channel for 53% of our off-lease vehicles.\nInsurance\nOur Insurance operations offer both consumer finance protection and insurance products sold primarily through the automotive dealer channel, and commercial insurance products sold directly to dealers. We serve approximately 2.4 million consumers nationwide across Finance and Insurance (F&I) and Property and Casualty (P&C) products. In addition, we offer F&I products in Canada, where we serve approximately 445 thousand consumers and are the VSC and protection plan provider for GM Canada. Our Insurance operations had $8.5 billion of assets at December 31, 2019, and generated $1.3 billion of total net revenue during 2019. As part of our focus on offering dealers a broad range of consumer financial and insurance products, we offer VSCs, VMCs, and GAP products. We also underwrite selected commercial insurance coverages, which primarily insure dealers' wholesale vehicle inventory. Ally Premier Protection is our flagship VSC offering, which provides coverage for new and used vehicles of virtually all makes and models. We also offer ClearGuard on the SmartAuction platform, which is a protection product designed to minimize the risk to dealers from arbitration claims for eligible vehicles sold at auction.\nFrom a dealer perspective, Ally provides significant value and expertise, which creates high retention rates and strong relationships. In addition to our product offerings, we provide consultative services and training to assist dealers in optimizing F&I results while achieving high levels of customer satisfaction and regulatory compliance. We also advise dealers regarding necessary liability and physical damage coverages.\nOur F&I products are primarily distributed indirectly through the automotive dealer network. We have established approximately 1,800 F&I dealer relationships nationwide and 600 dealer relationships in Canada, with a focus on growing dealer relationships in the future. Our VSCs for retail customers offer owners and lessees mechanical repair protection and roadside assistance for new and used vehicles beyond the manufacturer's new vehicle warranty. These VSCs are marketed to the public through automotive dealerships and on a direct response basis. We also offer GAP products, which allow the recovery of a specified amount beyond the covered vehicle's value in the event the vehicle is damaged or stolen and declared a total loss. We continue to evolve our product suite and digital capabilities to position our business for future opportunities through growing third-party relationships and sales through our online automotive lending exchange, Clearlane.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nWe have approximately 3,400 dealer relationships within our P&C business to whom we offer a variety of commercial products and levels of coverage. Vehicle inventory insurance for dealers provides physical damage protection for dealers' floorplan vehicles. Among dealers to whom we provide wholesale financing, our insurance product penetration rate is approximately 77%. Dealers who receive wholesale financing from us are eligible for insurance incentives such as automatic eligibility for our preferred insurance programs. In April 2019, we renewed our annual reinsurance agreement to obtain excess of loss coverage for our vehicle inventory insurance product to manage our risk of weather-related loss.\nA significant aspect of our Insurance operations is the investment of proceeds from premiums and other revenue sources. We use these investments to satisfy our obligations related to future claims at the time these claims are settled. Our Insurance operations have an Investment Committee, which develops guidelines and strategies for these investments. The guidelines established by this committee reflect our risk appetite, liquidity requirements, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors.\nMortgage Finance\nOur Mortgage Finance operations consist of the management of held-for-investment and held-for-sale consumer mortgage loan portfolios. Our held-for-investment portfolio includes bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and low-to-moderate income (LMI) mortgage loans originated by third parties, and our direct-to-consumer Ally Home mortgage offering. Our Mortgage Finance operations had $16.3 billion of assets at December 31, 2019, and generated $193 million of total net revenue in 2019.\nThrough the bulk loan channel, we purchase loans from several qualified sellers including direct originators and large aggregators who have the financial capacity to support strong representations and warranties and the industry knowledge and experience to originate high-quality assets. Bulk purchases are made on a servicing-released basis, allowing us to directly oversee servicing activities and manage prepayments through retention modification or refinancing through our direct-to-consumer channel. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased $3.5 billion of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties. Our mortgage loan purchases are held-for-investment.\nThrough our direct-to-consumer channel, which was introduced late in 2016, we offer a variety of competitively priced jumbo and conforming fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage products through a third-party fulfillment provider. Under our current arrangement, our direct-to-consumer conforming mortgages are originated as held-for-sale and sold, while jumbo and LMI mortgages are originated as held-for-investment. Loans originated in the direct-to-consumer channel are sourced by existing Ally customer marketing, prospect marketing on third-party websites, and email or direct mail campaigns. In April of 2019, we announced a strategic partnership with Better.com, which delivers an enhanced end-to-end digital mortgage experience for our customers through our direct-to-consumer channel. Through this partnership, Better.com conducts the sales, processing, underwriting, and closing for Ally's digital mortgage offerings in a highly innovative, scalable, and cost-efficient manner, while Ally retains control of all the marketing and advertising strategies and loan pricing. Ally and Better.com launched in 39 states since partnership inception. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we originated $2.7 billion of mortgage loans through our direct-to-consumer channel.\nThe combination of our bulk portfolio purchase program and our direct-to-consumer strategy provides the capacity to expand revenue sources and further grow and diversify our finance receivable portfolio with an attractive asset class while also deepening relationships with existing Ally customers.\nCorporate Finance\nOur Corporate Finance operations primarily provides senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle-market companies owned by private equity sponsors, and loans to asset managers that primarily provide leveraged loans. Our Corporate Finance operations had $5.8 billion of assets at December 31, 2019, and generated $284 million of total net revenue during 2019, and continues to offer attractive returns and diversification benefits to our broader lending portfolio. We believe our growing deposit-based funding model coupled with our expanded product offerings and deep industry relationships provide an advantage over our competition, which includes other banks as well as publicly and privately held finance companies. While there has been an increase in liquidity and competition in the middle-market lending space given a strong economic environment and favorable returns in this area, we have continued to prudently grow our lending portfolio with a focus on a disciplined and selective approach to credit quality, including a greater focus on asset-based loans. We seek markets and opportunities where our clients require customized, complex, and time-sensitive financing solutions. Our corporate finance lending portfolio is generally composed of first-lien, first-out loans.\nOur primary focus is on businesses owned by private equity sponsors with loans typically used for leveraged buyouts, mergers and acquisitions, debt refinancing, expansions, restructurings, and working capital. Additionally, our Lender Finance business provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct-lending activities. Our target commitment hold level for individual exposures ranges from $25 million to $150 million for individual borrowers, depending on product type. We also selectively arrange larger transactions that we may retain on-balance sheet or syndicate to other lenders. By syndicating loans to other lenders, we are able to provide financing commitments in excess of our target hold levels to our customers and generate loan syndication fee income while limiting our risk exposure to individual borrowers. Loan facilities typically include both a revolver and term loan component. All of our loans are floating-rate facilities with maturities, typically ranging from two to seven years. In certain instances, we may be offered the opportunity to make small equity investments in our borrowers, where we could benefit from potential appreciation in the company's value. The portfolio is well diversified across multiple industries including manufacturing, distribution, services, and other specialty sectors. These specialty sectors include our Technology Finance and Healthcare verticals. Our Technology Finance vertical provides financing solutions to venture capital-backed, technology-based companies. The Healthcare vertical provides financing across the healthcare spectrum including services, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and medical devices and supplies. We also provide a commercial real estate product focused on lending to skilled nursing\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nfacilities, senior housing, medical office buildings, and hospitals. Other smaller complementary product offerings that help strengthen our reputation as a full-spectrum provider of financing solutions for borrowers include selectively offering second-out loans on certain transactions and issuing letters of credit through Ally Bank.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other primarily consists of centralized corporate treasury activities such as management of the cash and corporate investment securities and loan portfolios, short- and long-term debt, retail and brokered deposit liabilities, derivative instruments, original issue discount, and the residual impacts of our corporate funds-transfer pricing (FTP) and treasury asset liability management (ALM) activities. Corporate and Other also includes activity related to certain equity investments, which primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and FRB stock, the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio, which primarily consists of loans originated prior to January 1, 2009, and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments.\nCorporate and Other also includes the results of Ally Invest, our digital brokerage and wealth management offering, which enables us to complement our competitive deposit products with low-cost investing. The digital wealth management business aligns with our strategy to create a premier digital financial services company and provides additional sources of fee income through asset management and certain other fees, with minimal balance sheet utilization. This business also provides an additional source of low-cost brokered deposits through arrangements with Ally Invest's clearing broker.\nThrough Ally Invest, we are able to offer a broader array of products through a fully integrated digital consumer platform centered around self-directed products and digital advisory services. Ally Invest's suite of commission-free and low-cost investing options serve both active and passive investors with diverse and evolving financial objectives through a transparent online process. Our digital platform and broad product offerings are enhanced by outstanding client-focused and user-friendly customer service that is accessible twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, via the phone, web or email-consistent with the Ally brand.\nAlly Invest provides clients with self-directed trading services for a variety of securities including stocks, options, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and fixed-income products through Ally Invest Securities. Ally Invest Securities also offers margin lending, which allows customers to borrow money by using securities and cash currently held in their accounts as collateral. Through Ally Invest Forex, we offer self-directed investors and traders the ability to trade over 50 currency pairs through a state-of-the-art forex trading platform.\nAlly Invest also provides digital advisory services to clients through web-based solutions, informational resources, and virtual interaction through Ally Invest Advisors, an SEC-registered investment advisor. These services have emerged as a fast-growing segment within the financial services industry over the past several years. Ally Invest Advisors provides clients the opportunity to obtain professional portfolio management services in return for a fee based upon the client's assets under management. We also offer cash enhanced portfolios that incur no management fee. A number of core managed portfolios are offered, which hold ETFs diversified across asset class, industry sector, and geography and which are customized for clients based on risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and wealth ratio.\nAdditionally, beginning in October 2019 with the acquisition of Health Credit Services, financial information related to our point-of-sale consumer unsecured financing is included within Corporate and Other. The Health Credit Services business has been renamed Ally Lending and currently serves medical service providers by enabling promotional and fixed rate installment-loan products through a fully digital application process that offers direct integration with health care provider systems. This platform includes providing underwriting, financing application and loan processing, servicing and collections. While we currently focus on healthcare-related lending, we believe the market outlook for point-of-sale lending provides attractive opportunities for future diversification. Point-of-sale lending broadens our capabilities, expands our product offering into consumer unsecured lending, all while helping to further meet financial needs of our customers. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the acquisition of Health Credit Services.\nThe net financing revenue and other interest income of our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance operations include the results of an FTP process that insulates these operations from interest rate volatility by matching assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. The FTP process assigns charge rates to the assets and credit rates to the liabilities within our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance operations, based on anticipated maturity and a benchmark rate curve plus an assumed credit spread. The assumed credit spread represents the cost of funds for each asset class based on a blend of funding channels available to the enterprise, including unsecured and secured capital markets, private funding facilities, and deposits. In addition, a risk-based methodology is used to allocate equity to these operations.\nDeposits\nWe are focused on growing a stable deposit base and deepening relationships with our nearly 2.0 million primary deposit customers by leveraging our compelling brand and strong value proposition. Ally Bank is a direct bank with no branch network that obtains retail deposits directly from customers through internet, telephone, mobile, and mail channels. We have grown our deposits with a strong brand that is based on a promise of being straightforward with our customers and offering high-quality customer service. Ally Bank has consistently increased its share of the direct banking deposit market and remains one of the largest direct banks in terms of retail deposit balances. Our strong retention rates and a growing customer base reflect the strength of our brand and, together with competitive deposit rates, continue to drive growth in retail deposits. At December 31, 2019, Ally Bank had $120.8 billion of total deposits-including $103.7 billion of retail deposits, which grew $14.6 billion, or 16% during 2019. Over the past several years, the continued growth of our retail-deposit base has contributed to a more favorable mix of lower cost funding and we continue to focus on efficient deposit growth by continuing to expand the deposit value proposition beyond competitive deposit rates. Our segment results include cost of funds associated with these deposit-product offerings.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOur deposit products and services are designed to develop long-term customer relationships and capitalize on the shift in consumer preference for direct banking. These products and services appeal to a broad group of customers, many of whom appreciate a streamlined digital experience coupled with our strong value proposition. Ally Bank offers a full spectrum of deposit product offerings, such as savings and money-market accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, CDs, including several raise-your-rate CD terms, IRAs, and trust accounts. Our deposit services include Zelle\u00ae person-to-person payment services, eCheck remote deposit capture, and mobile banking. In addition, brokered deposits are obtained through third-party intermediaries.\nWe believe we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from the consumer-driven shift from branch banking to direct banking as demonstrated by the growth we have experienced. Our nearly 2.0 million deposit customers and 4.0 million retail bank accounts as of December 31, 2019, reflect increases from 1.6 million and 3.2 million, respectively, as compared to December 31, 2018. Our customer base spans across diverse demographic segmentations and socioeconomic bands. Our direct bank business model resonates particularly well with the millennial generation, which consistently makes up the largest percentage of our new customers. According to a 2019 American Bankers Association survey, 83% of customers prefer to do their banking most often via digital and other direct channels (internet, mobile, telephone, and mail). Furthermore, over the past five years, estimated direct banking deposits as a percentage of the broader retail deposits market increased by approximately 3 percentage points, from 7% to 10%. We have received a positive response to innovative savings and other deposit products and have been recognized as a best online bank\u201d by industry and consumer publications. Ally Bank's competitive direct banking includes online and mobile banking features such as electronic bill pay, remote deposit, and electronic funds transfer nationwide, with innovative interfaces such as banking through Alexa-enabled devices, and no minimum balance requirements.\nWe intend to continue to grow and invest in our direct online bank and further capitalize on the shift in consumer preference for direct banking with expanded digital capabilities and customer-centric products that utilize advanced analytics for personalized interactions and other technologies that improve efficiency, security, and the customer's connection to the brand. We are focused on growing, deepening, and further leveraging the customer relationships and brand loyalty that exist with Ally Bank as a catalyst for future loan and deposit growth, as well as revenue opportunities that arise from introducing Ally Bank deposit customers to our digital wealth management offering, Ally Invest.\nFunding and Liquidity\nOur funding strategy targets a stable retail deposit base, supplemented by brokered deposits, public and private secured debt, and public unsecured debt. These diversified funding sources are managed across products, markets, and investors to enhance funding flexibility and stability, resulting in a more cost-effective long-term funding strategy.\nPrudent expansion of asset originations at Ally Bank and continued growth of a stable deposit base continue to be the cornerstone of our long-term liquidity strategy. Retail deposits provide a low-cost source of funds that are less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility, or changes in our credit ratings than other funding sources. At December 31, 2019, deposit liabilities totaled $120.8 billion, which reflects an increase of $14.6 billion as compared to December 31, 2018. Deposits as a percentage of total liability-based funding increased nine percentage points to 75% at December 31, 2019, as compared to December 31, 2018.\nIn addition to building a larger deposit base, we continue to remain active in the securitization markets to finance our automotive loan portfolios. During 2019, we issued $3.6 billion in securitizations backed by consumer automotive loans. Securitizations continue to be a reliable and cost-effective source of funding due to structural efficiencies and the established market. Additionally, for retail loans and operating leases, the term structure of the transaction locks in funding for a specified pool of loans and operating leases. Once a pool of consumer automotive loans is selected and placed into a securitization, the underlying assets and corresponding debt amortize simultaneously resulting in committed and matched funding for the life of the asset. We manage the execution risk arising from securitizations by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and committed secured credit facilities.\nAs we continue to migrate assets to Ally Bank and grow our bank funding capabilities, our need for funding at the parent company has been reduced. At December 31, 2019, 93% of Ally's total assets were within Ally Bank. This compares to approximately 89% as of December 31, 2018. Longer-term unsecured debt is the primary funding source utilized at the parent company. At December 31, 2019, we had $2.3 billion and $702 million of unsecured long-term debt principal maturing in 2020 and 2021, respectively. We plan to reduce our reliance on market-based funding by continuing to focus on stable, lower cost retail deposit funding.\nThe strategies outlined above have allowed us to build and maintain a conservative liquidity position. Total available liquidity at December 31, 2019, was $29.9 billion. Absolute levels of liquidity increased during 2019 primarily as a result of continued growth in our portfolio of highly liquid investment securities. Refer to the section below titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital for a further discussion about liquidity risk management.\nCredit Strategy\nOur strategy and approach to extending credit, as well as our management of credit risk, are critical elements of our business. Credit performance is influenced by a number of factors including our risk appetite, our credit and underwriting processes, our monitoring and collection efforts, the financial condition of our borrowers, the performance of loan collateral, and various macroeconomic considerations. The majority of our businesses offer credit products and services, which drive overall business performance. Consistent with our risk appetite, our business lines operate under credit standards that consider the borrower's ability and willingness to repay loans. The failure to effectively manage credit risk can have a direct and significant impact on Ally's earnings, capital position, and reputation. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for a further discussion of credit risk and performance of our consumer and commercial credit portfolios.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nWithin our Automotive Finance operations, we target a mix of consumers across the credit spectrum to achieve portfolio diversification and to optimize the risk and return of our consumer automotive portfolio. This is achieved through the utilization of robust credit decisioning processes coupled with granular pricing that is differentiated across our proprietary credit tiers. While we are a full-spectrum automotive finance lender, the significant majority of our consumer automotive loans are underwritten within the prime-lending segment. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses, as of December 31, 2019, was approximately 11.6%. During 2019, our strategy for originations was to optimize the deployment of capital by focusing on risk-adjusted returns against available origination opportunities, which has included a gradual and measured shift toward our Growth channel including used vehicle financings.\nThe Mortgage Finance team focuses on applicants with stronger credit profiles and with income streams to support repayments of the loan and operates under credit standards that consider and assess the value of the underlying real estate in accordance with prudent credit practices and regulatory requirements. Refer to the Mortgage Finance section of the MD&A that follows for credit quality information about purchases and originations of consumer mortgages held-for-investment. We generally rely on appraisals conducted by licensed appraisers in conformance with the expectations and requirements of Fannie Mae and federal regulators. When appropriate, we require credit enhancements such as private mortgage insurance. We price each mortgage loan that we originate based on a number of factors, including the customer's FICO\u00ae Score, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and the size of the loan. For bulk purchases, we only purchase loans from sellers with the financial wherewithal to support their representations and warranties and the experience to originate high-quality loans.\nAs further described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 1, 2019, we acquired Health Credit Services, a digital payment provider that operates under the name Ally Lending, and offers point-of-sale financing to consumers. This expansion into digital point-of-sale lending further broadens Ally's product portfolio to unsecured consumer financing. As of December 31, 2019, our gross carrying value of finance receivables related to Ally Lending was $212 million.\nWithin our commercial lending portfolios, Corporate Finance operations primarily provide senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle-market companies. During 2019, we continued to prudently grow this portfolio with a disciplined and selective approach to credit quality, which has generally included the avoidance of covenant-light lending arrangements. This includes growth of our lender finance vertical launched in 2019, which provides senior secured revolving credit facilities to asset managers, collateralized by a portfolio of loans. Within our commercial automotive business, we continue to offer a variety of dealer-centric lending products that primarily relate to floorplan financing and term loans. These commercial products are an important aspect of our dealer relationships and offer a secured lending arrangement with a number of strong collateral protections in the event of dealer default. The performance of our commercial credit portfolios continues to remain strong, as nonperforming finance receivables and loans decreased $134 million from December 31, 2018, to $215 million at December 31, 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, we recognized total net charge-offs of $49 million and $8 million, respectively, within our commercial lending portfolios, primarily driven by partial charge-offs of four exposures within our Corporate Finance portfolio, as well as three accounts within our commercial automotive portfolio. Despite the increase in net charge-offs, our total commercial net charge-off ratio represented 0.1% of average commercial receivables and loans for the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further details.\nDuring 2019, the U.S. economy continued to modestly expand, led by consumer spending. The labor market remained robust during the year, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.5% as of December 31, 2019. Our credit portfolios will continue to be impacted by household, business, economic, and market conditions-including used vehicle and housing price levels, and unemployment levels-and their impact to our borrowers. We expect to experience modest downward pressure on used vehicle values during 2020.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuring 2013 and 2012, certain disposal groups met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. The remaining activity relates to previous discontinued operations for which we continue to have wind-down, legal, and minimal operational costs. For all periods presented, the operating results for these operations have been removed from continuing operations. The MD&A has been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nPrimary Business Lines\nDealer Financial Services, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance are our primary business lines. The following table summarizes the operating results excluding discontinued operations of each business line. Operating results for each of the business lines are more fully described in the MD&A sections that follow.\n\nn/m = not meaningful\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results excluding discontinued operations for the periods shown. Refer to the operating segment sections of the MD&A that follows for a more complete discussion of operating results by business line. For a discussion of our fiscal 2018 results compared to fiscal 2017, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nn/m = not meaningful\n2019 Compared to 2018\nWe earned net income from continuing operations of $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, results were favorably impacted by higher net financing revenue, primarily driven by higher yields and growth in earning assets. Results for the year ended December 31, 2019, were also favorably impacted by a release of valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards during the second quarter of 2019, and higher market values of equity investments primarily within our Insurance operations. These items were partially offset by higher provision for loan losses, and higher noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet financing revenue and other interest income increased $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Within our Automotive Finance operations, consumer automotive financing revenue benefited from improved portfolio yields as a result of our continued focus on expanding risk-adjusted returns, and higher average consumer asset levels resulting from sustained asset growth. During the year ended December 31, 2019, commercial automotive net financing revenue also increased due primarily to higher yields resulting from higher average benchmark interest rates. Income from interest and dividends on investment securities and other earning assets, including cash and cash equivalents, increased $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, due to both higher yields and higher balances of investment securities as we continue to utilize this portfolio to manage liquidity and generate a stable source of income. Financing revenue and other interest income within our Corporate Finance operations was favorably impacted by our strategy to prudently grow assets and our product suite within existing verticals while selectively pursuing opportunities to broaden industry and product diversification. The increase to financing revenue and other interest income was partially offset by an increase of 17% in total interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWhile we continue to shift borrowings toward more cost-effective deposit funding and reduce our dependence on market-based funding through reductions in higher-cost secured and unsecured debt, interest expense increased as a result of higher market rates across all funding\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nsources. Additionally, our overall borrowing levels were higher to support the growth in our lending operations. Our total deposit liabilities increased $14.6 billion to $120.8 billion as of December 31, 2019, as compared to December 31, 2018.\nInsurance premiums and service revenue earned was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $1.0 billion for 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to vehicle inventory insurance portfolio growth and rate increases.\nOther gain on investments, net increased $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due to favorable market conditions during the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain on investments for the year ended December 31, 2019, includes $92 million of unrealized gains as a result of changes in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities, compared to $121 million of unrealized losses in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe provision for loan losses was $998 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $918 million in 2018. The increase in provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by reserve reductions during the year ended December 31, 2018, associated with hurricane activity experienced during 2017 within our consumer automotive loan portfolio, the acquisition of the Health Credit Services portfolio, and increases within the corporate finance portfolio due to favorable credit ratings migration in 2018 and portfolio growth, as well as a $6 million recovery of a previously charged-off loan in the second quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting and higher recoveries. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion on our provision for loan losses.\nNoninterest expense increased $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was driven by increased expenses to support the growth of our consumer product suite. We continue to make investments in our technology platform to enhance the customer experience and expand our digital capabilities, and in marketing activities to promote brand awareness and drive retail deposit growth. Additionally, the increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was driven by higher insurance losses and loss adjustment expense within our insurance operations primarily related to growth experienced in our portfolio of products.\nWe recognized total income tax expense from continuing operations of $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $359 million in 2018. The decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to a release of valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards during the second quarter of 2019. The valuation allowance release was primarily driven by our current capacity to engage in certain foreign securitization transactions and the market demand from investors related to these transactions, coupled with the anticipated timing of the forecasted expiration of certain foreign tax credit carryforwards. Additionally, the decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was partially offset by the tax effects of an increase in pretax earnings and a nonrecurring tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance against state net operating loss carryforwards as a result of a state tax law enactment in the third quarter of 2018.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nDealer Financial Services\nResults for Dealer Financial Services are presented by reportable segment, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations.\nAutomotive Finance\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of our Automotive Finance operations. The amounts presented are before the elimination of balances and transactions with our other reportable segments.\n\nn/m = not meaningful\nComponents of net operating lease revenue, included in amounts above, were as follows.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the average balance and yield of the loan and operating lease portfolios of our Automotive Financing operations.\n\n (a) Average balances are calculated using a combination of monthly and daily average methodologies. \n (b) Nonperforming finance receivables and loans are included in the average balances. For information on our accounting policies regarding nonperforming status, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (c) Includes the effects of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges. \n (d) Consists primarily of automotive dealer term loans, including those to finance dealership land and buildings, and dealer fleet financing. \n (e) Yield includes gains on the sale of off-lease vehicles of $69 million, $90 million, and $124 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Excluding these gains on sale, the yield would be 4.93%, 4.35%, and 5.10% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.  2019 Compared to 2018\nOur Automotive Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we continued to focus on driving capital optimization and expanding risk-adjusted returns. As a result, we experienced higher consumer loan financing revenue, primarily due to an increase in consumer loan portfolio yields and asset levels. We also experienced higher commercial financing revenue due to higher yields resulting from higher average benchmark interest rates. Growth in finance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, was partially offset by higher interest expense driven by higher funding costs and growth in our consumer loan portfolio as well as an increase in provision for loan losses.\nConsumer automotive loan financing revenue increased $488 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to improved portfolio yields as a result of our continued focus on expanding risk-adjusted returns, and higher average consumer asset levels resulting from sustained asset growth, including a continued focus on the used-vehicle portfolio primarily through franchised dealers and growth in application volume from our dealer network. Through these actions, we continue to optimize our origination mix and achieve greater portfolio diversification.\nCommercial loan financing revenue increased $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher yields resulting from higher average benchmark interest rates. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in average outstanding floorplan assets compared to 2018.\nInterest expense was $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $2.5 billion for the year in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher funding costs and growth in our consumer automotive loan portfolio.\nWe recorded gains from the sale of consumer automotive loans of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to gains of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We continue to selectively utilize whole-loan sales to proactively manage our credit exposure, asset levels, funding, and capital utilization, including the sale of previously written-down consumer automotive loans related to consumers in Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nOther income decreased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in servicing fee income resulting from lower levels of off-balance-sheet consumer automotive serviced loans and also attributable to a decrease in remarketing fee income resulting from lower operating lease termination volume.\nTotal net operating lease revenue increased $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to favorable performance and mix in our outstanding lease portfolio. Additionally, we recognized lower remarketing gains of $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $90 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a lower number of terminated units and lower gain per unit. The lower number of terminated units was primarily due to the runoff of our legacy GM operating lease portfolio, which was substantially wound-down as of June 30, 2018. Refer to the Operating Lease Residual Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe provision for loan losses was $962 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $920 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in provision for loan losses was primarily driven by reserve reductions during the year ended December 31, 2018, associated with hurricane activity experienced during 2017 in our consumer automotive loan portfolio. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting, and higher recoveries. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&A for further discussion.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAutomotive Financing Volume\nOur Automotive Finance operations provide automotive financing services to consumers and automotive dealers. For consumers, we provide retail financing and leasing for new and used vehicles, and through our commercial automotive financing operations, we fund dealer purchases of new and used vehicles through wholesale floorplan financing and provide dealer term and revolving loans and automotive fleet financing.\nAcquisition and Underwriting\nOur consumer underwriting process is focused on multidimensional risk factors and data driven risk-adjusted probabilities that are continuously monitored and routinely updated. Each application is placed into an analytical category based on specific aspects of the applicant's credit profile and loan structure. We then evaluate the application by applying a proprietary credit scoring algorithm tailored to its applicable category. Inputs into this algorithm include, but are not limited to, proprietary scores and deal structure variables such as LTV, new or used vehicle collateral, and term of financing. The output of the algorithm is used to sort applications into various credit tiers (S, A, B, C, D, and E). Credit tiers help determine our primary indication of credit quality and pricing, and are also communicated to the dealer that submitted the application. This process is built on long established credit risk fundamentals to determine both the applicant's ability and willingness to repay. While advances in excess of 100% of the vehicle collateral value at loan origination-notwithstanding cash down and vehicle trade in value-are typical in the industry (primarily due to additional costs such as mechanical warranty contracts, taxes, license, and title fees), our pricing, risk, and underwriting processes are rooted in statistical analysis to manage this risk.\nOur underwriting process uses a combination of automated strategies and manual evaluation by an experienced team of dedicated underwriters. We have developed an automated process to expedite the review of applications with various combinations of credit factors that we have observed over time to substantially outperform or underperform in terms of net credit losses. As a result, automated decisions are based on many clusters of credit factors rather than a small set of benchmark characteristics. Automated approvals are primarily limited to the higher-quality credit tiers and automated rejections to lower-quality credit tiers. Underwriting is also governed by our credit policies, which set forth guidelines such as acceptable transaction parameters and verification requirements. For higher-risk approved transactions, these guidelines require verification of details such as applicant income and employment through documentation provided by the applicant or other data sources.\nUnderwriters have a limited ability to approve exceptions to the guidelines in our credit policies. For example, an exception may be approved to allow a term or a ratio of payment-to-income, debt-to-income, or LTV greater than that in the guidelines. Exceptions must be approved by underwriters with appropriate approval authority and generally are based on compensating factors. We monitor exceptions with the goal of limiting them to a small portion of approved applications and originated loans, and rarely permit more than a single exception to avoid layered risk.\nConsumer Automotive Financing\nNew- and used-vehicle consumer financing through dealerships takes one of two forms: retail installment sales contracts (retail contracts) and operating lease contracts. We purchase retail contracts for new and used vehicles and operating lease contracts from dealers after those contracts are executed by the dealers and the consumers. Our consumer automotive financing operations generate revenue primarily through finance charges on retail contracts and rental payments on operating lease contracts. In connection with operating lease contracts, we recognize depreciation expense on the vehicle over the operating lease contract period and we may also recognize a gain or loss on the remarketing of the vehicle at the end of the lease.\nThe amount we pay a dealer for a retail contract is based on the rate of finance charge agreed by the dealer and customer, the negotiated purchase price of the vehicle, any other products such as service contracts, less any vehicle trade-in value, any down payment from the consumer, and any available automotive manufacturer incentives. Under the retail contract, the consumer is obligated to make payments in an amount equal to the purchase price of the vehicle (less any trade-in or down payment) plus finance charges at a rate negotiated between the consumer and the dealer. In addition, the consumer is responsible for charges related to past-due payments. Consistent with industry practice, when we purchase the retail contract, we pay the dealer at a rate discounted below the rate agreed by the dealer and the consumer (generally described in the industry as the buy rate\u201d). Our agreements with dealers limit the amount of the discount that we will accept. Although we do not own the vehicles that we finance through retail contracts, our agreements require that we hold a perfected security interest in those vehicles.\nWith respect to consumer leasing, we purchase operating lease contracts and the associated vehicles from dealerships after those contracts are executed by the dealers and the consumers. The amount we pay a dealer for an operating lease contract is based on the negotiated price for the vehicle, less any vehicle trade-in, any down payment from the consumer, and any available automotive manufacturer incentives. Under an operating lease, the consumer is obligated to make payments in amounts equal to the amount by which the negotiated purchase price of the vehicle (less any trade-in value, down payment, or any available manufacturer incentives) exceeds the contract residual value (including residual support) of the vehicle at lease termination, plus operating lease rental charges. The consumer is also generally responsible for charges related to past-due payments, excess mileage, excessive wear and tear, and certain disposal fees where applicable. At contract inception, we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle. This evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model, which includes variables such as vehicle age, expected mileage, seasonality, segment factors, vehicle type, economic indicators, production cycle, automotive manufacturer incentives, and shifts in used vehicle supply. This internally generated data is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nPeriodically, we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on then-current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense, if appropriate, over the remaining life of the contract. At termination, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense.\nOur standard consumer operating lease contract, SmartLease, requires a monthly payment by the consumer. We also offer an alternative leasing plan, SmartLease Plus, which requires one up-front payment of all operating lease amounts at the time the consumer takes possession of the vehicle.\nOur standard consumer lease contracts are operating leases; therefore, credit losses on the operating lease portfolio are not as significant as losses on retail contracts because lease credit losses are primarily limited to past-due payments and assessed fees. Since some of these fees are not assessed until the vehicle is returned, these losses on the operating lease portfolio are correlated with lease termination volume. Operating lease accounts over 30 days past due represented 1.34% and 1.48% of the portfolio at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nWith respect to all financed vehicles, whether subject to a retail contract or an operating lease contract, we require that property damage insurance be obtained by the consumer. In addition, for operating lease contracts, we require that bodily injury, collision, and comprehensive insurance be obtained by the consumer.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our portfolio yield for consumer automotive loans increased 46 basis points relative to the year ended December 31, 2018. We set our buy rates using a granular, risk-based methodology factoring in several variables including interest costs, projected net average annualized loss rates at the time of origination, anticipated operating costs, and targeted return on equity. Over the past several years, we have continued to focus on optimizing pricing relative to market interest rates as well as portfolio diversification and the used-vehicle segment, primarily through franchised dealers, which has contributed to higher yields on our consumer automotive loan portfolio. Commensurate with this shift in origination mix, we continue to maintain consistent, disciplined underwriting within our new and used consumer automotive loan originations. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.4 billion, or approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to $8.3 billion, or approximately 11.7% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table presents retail loan originations by credit tier and product type.\n\n (a) Represents Ally's internal credit score, incorporating numerous borrower and structure attributes including: severity and aging of delinquency; number of credit inquiries; LTV ratio; and payment-to-income ratio. We periodically update our underwriting scorecard, which can have an impact on our credit tier scoring. We originated an insignificant amount of retail loans classified below Tier C during the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the percentage of total retail loan originations, in dollars, by the loan term in months.\n\n (a) Excludes recreational vehicle (RV) loans. RV lending was discontinued in 2018.  Retail originations with a term of 76 months or more represented 15% of total retail originations for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to 13% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and 14% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Substantially all of the loans originated with a term of 76 months or more during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were considered to be prime and in credit tiers S, A, or B. We define prime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO\u00ae Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of 620 or greater.\nThe following table presents the percentage of total outstanding retail loans by origination year.\n\nThe 2019, 2018, and 2017 vintages compose 83% of the overall retail portfolio as of December 31, 2019, and have higher average buy rates than older vintages.\nThe following tables present the total retail loan and operating lease origination dollars and percentage mix by product type and by channel.\n\n (a) Includes CSG originations of $4.0 billion, $3.7 billion, and $3.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and RV originations of $238 million and $459 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, total consumer automotive loan and operating lease originations increased $898 million, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased originations from the Growth channel, which was partially offset by lower originations from the GM channel. Over the past several years we have continued to diversify our portfolio through the Growth channel, including increased levels of used vehicle loan volume, which we view as an attractive asset class consistent with our continued focus on obtaining appropriate risk-adjusted returns.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nWe have included origination metrics by loan term and FICO\u00ae Score within this MD&A. However, the proprietary way we evaluate risk is based on multiple inputs as described in the section above titled Acquisition and Underwriting.\nThe following table presents the percentage of retail loan and operating lease originations, in dollars, by FICO\u00ae Score and product type.\n\n (a) Unscored are primarily CSG contracts with business entities that have no FICO\u00ae Score.  Originations with a FICO\u00ae Score of less than 620 (considered nonprime) represented 11% of total consumer loan and operating lease originations for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 10% for year ended December 31, 2018. Consumer loans and operating leases with FICO\u00ae Scores of less than 540 continued to compose only 1% of total originations for the year ended December 31, 2019. Nonprime applications that are not automatically declined by our proprietary credit-scoring models for risk reasons are manually reviewed and decisioned by an experienced underwriting team. Nonprime applications are subject to more stringent underwriting criteria (for example, minimum payment-to-income ratio and vehicle mileage, and maximum amount financed), and our nonprime loan portfolio generally does not include any loans with a term of 76 months or more. For discussion of our credit-risk-management practices and performance, refer to the section titled Risk Management.\nManufacturer Marketing Incentives\nAutomotive manufacturers may elect to sponsor incentive programs on retail contracts and operating leases by subsidizing finance rates below market rates. These marketing incentives are also referred to as rate support or subvention. When an automotive manufacturer subsidizes the finance rate, we are compensated at contract inception for the present value of the difference between the manufacturer-supported customer rate and our standard rate. For a retail contract, we defer and recognize this amount as a yield adjustment over the life of the contract. For an operating lease contract, this payment reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset.\nAutomotive manufacturers may also elect to sponsor incentives, referred to as residual support, on operating leases. When an automotive manufacturer provides residual support, we receive payment at contract inception that increases the contractual operating lease residual value resulting in a lower operating lease payment from the customer. The payment received from the automotive manufacturer reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset. Other operating lease incentive programs sponsored by automotive manufacturers may be made at contract inception indirectly through dealers, which also reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset.\nUnder what the automotive finance industry refers to as pull-ahead programs,\u201d consumers may be encouraged by the manufacturer to terminate operating leases early in conjunction with the acquisition of a new vehicle. As part of these programs, we waive all or a portion of\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nthe customer's remaining payment obligation. Under most programs, the automotive manufacturer compensates us for a portion of the foregone revenue from the waived payments. This compensation may be partially offset to the extent that our remarketing sales proceeds are higher than otherwise would be realized if the vehicle had been remarketed upon contract maturity.\nServicing\nWe have historically serviced all retail contracts and operating leases we originated. However, our expansion into direct-to-consumer lending and other relationships have resulted in the employment of third-party servicers for a small portion of the portfolio. On occasion, we have sold a portion of the retail contracts we originated through whole-loan sales and securitizations, but generally retained the right to service and earn a servicing fee for our servicing functions.\nServicing activities consist largely of collecting and processing customer payments, responding to customer concerns and inquiries, processing customer requests (including those for payoff quotes, total-loss handling, and payment modifications), maintaining a perfected security interest in the financed vehicle, engaging in collections activity, and disposing of off-lease and repossessed vehicles. Servicing activities are generally consistent across our Automotive Finance operations; however, certain practices may be influenced by state laws.\nOur customers have the option to receive monthly billing statements and remit payment by mail or through electronic fund transfers, or to establish online web-based account administration through Ally Auto Online Services. Customer payments are processed by regional third-party processing centers that electronically transfer payment information to customers' accounts.\nCollections activity includes initiating contact with customers who fail to comply with the terms of the retail contract or operating lease agreement by sending reminder notices or contacting customers via various channels when an account becomes 3 to 20 days past due. The type of collection treatment and level of intensity increases as the account becomes more delinquent. The nature and timing of these activities depend on the repayment risk of the account.\nDuring the collections process, we may offer a payment extension to a customer experiencing temporary financial difficulty. A payment extension enables the customer to delay monthly payments for 30, 60, or 90 days. Extensions granted to a customer typically do not exceed 90 days in the aggregate during any 12-month period or 180 days in aggregate over the life of the contract. During the extension period, finance charges continue to accrue. If the customer's financial difficulty is not temporary but we believe the customer is willing and able to repay their loan at a lower payment amount, we may offer to modify the remaining obligation, extending the term and lowering the scheduled monthly payment. In those cases, the outstanding balance generally remains unchanged. The use of extensions and modifications helps us mitigate financial loss. Extensions may assist in cases where we believe the customer will recover from short-term financial difficulty and resume regularly scheduled payments. Modifications may also be utilized in cases where we believe customers can fulfill the obligation with lower payments over a longer period. Before offering an extension or modification, we evaluate and take into account the capacity of the customer to meet the revised payment terms. Generally, we do not consider extensions that fall within our policy guidelines to represent more than an insignificant delay in payment, and therefore, they are not considered a Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR). Although the granting of an extension could delay the eventual charge-off of an account, typically we are able to repossess and sell the related collateral, thereby mitigating the loss. At December 31, 2019, 10.6% of the total amount outstanding in the servicing portfolio had been granted an extension or was rewritten, compared to 11.3% at December 31, 2018.\nSubject to legal considerations, we normally begin repossession activity once an account is at least eighty-five days past due. Repossession may occur earlier if we determine the customer is unwilling to pay, the vehicle is in danger of being damaged or hidden, or the customer voluntarily surrenders the vehicle. Approved third-party repossession vendors handle the repossession activity. Generally, after repossession, the customer is given a period of time to redeem the vehicle or reinstate the contract by paying off the account or bringing the account current, respectively. If the vehicle is not redeemed or the contract is not reinstated, the vehicle is sold at auction. If the proceeds do not cover the unpaid balance, including unpaid earned finance charges and allowable expenses, the resulting deficiency is charged-off. Asset recovery centers pursue collections on accounts that have been charged-off, including those accounts where the vehicle was repossessed, and skip accounts where the vehicle cannot be located.\nOur total consumer automotive serviced portfolio was $80.6 billion and $79.7 billion at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively, compared to our consumer automotive on-balance-sheet serviced portfolio of $80.0 billion and $77.8 billion.\nRemarketing and Sales of Leased Vehicles\nWhen we acquire an operating lease, we assume ownership of the vehicle from the dealer. Neither the consumer nor the dealer is responsible for the value of the vehicle at the time of lease termination. When vehicles are not purchased by customers or the receiving dealer at scheduled lease termination, the vehicle is returned to us for remarketing. We generally bear the risk of loss to the extent the value of a leased vehicle upon remarketing is below the expected residual value. Our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and the proceeds realized from vehicle sales. Our methods of vehicle sales at lease termination primarily include the following:\n \u2022 Sale to dealer - After the lessee declines an option to purchase the off-lease vehicle, the dealer who accepts it has the opportunity to purchase it directly from us at a price we define. \n \u2022 Internet auctions - Once the lessee and the dealer decline to purchase the off-lease vehicle, we offer it to dealers and other third parties through our proprietary internet site (SmartAuction). Through SmartAuction, we seek to maximize the net sales proceeds from an off-lease vehicle by reducing the time between vehicle return and ultimate disposition, reducing holding costs, and \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nbroadening the number of prospective buyers. We use SmartAuction for our own vehicles and make it available for third-party use. We earn a service fee for every third-party vehicle sold through SmartAuction, which includes the cost of ClearGuard coverage, our protection product designed to assist in minimizing the risk to dealers of arbitration claims for eligible vehicles. In 2019, approximately 270,000 vehicles were sold through SmartAuction.\n \u2022 Physical auctions - We dispose of an off-lease vehicle not purchased at termination by the lessee or dealer or sold on SmartAuction through traditional third-party, physical auctions. We are responsible for handling decisions at the auction including arranging for inspections, authorizing repairs and reconditioning, and determining whether bids received at auction should be accepted.  We employ an internal team, including statisticians, to manage our analysis of projected used vehicle values and residual risk. This team aids in the pricing of new operating leases, managing the disposal process including vehicle concentration risk, geographic optimization of vehicles to maximize gains, disposal platform (internet vs. physical), and evaluating our residual risk on a real-time basis. This team tracks market movements of used vehicles using data down to the VIN level including trim and options, vehicle age, mileage, and seasonality factors that we feel are more relevant than other published indices (for example, Manheim, NADA). This analysis includes vehicles sold on our SmartAuction platform, as well as vehicles sold through Manheim, ADESA, and over 200 independent physical auction sites. We believe this analysis gives us a competitive advantage over our peers.\nCommercial Automotive Financing\nAutomotive Wholesale Dealer Financing\nOne of the most important aspects of our dealer relationships is providing wholesale floorplan financing for new- and used-vehicle inventories at dealerships. Wholesale floorplan financing, including syndicated loan arrangements, represents the largest portion of our commercial automotive financing business and is the primary source of funding for dealers' purchases of new and used vehicles.\nWholesale floorplan financing is generally extended in the form of lines of credit to individual dealers. These lines of credit are secured by the vehicles financed and all other vehicle inventory, which provide strong collateral protection in the event of dealership default. Additional collateral (for example, blanket lien over all dealership assets) or other credit enhancements (for example, personal guarantees from dealership owners) are generally obtained to further mitigate credit risk. Furthermore, in some cases, we may benefit from situations where an automotive manufacturer repurchases vehicles. These repurchases may serve as an additional layer of protection in the event of repossession of dealership new-vehicle inventory or dealership franchise termination. The amount we advance to dealers for a new vehicle is equal to 100% of the manufacturer's wholesale invoice price. The amount we advance to dealers for a used vehicle is typically 90-100% of the dealer's cost of acquiring it. Interest on wholesale floorplan financing is generally payable monthly. The majority of wholesale floorplan financing is structured to yield interest at a floating rate indexed to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) or the Prime Rate. The rate for a particular dealer is based on, among other things, competitive factors, the size of the account, and the dealer's creditworthiness. Additionally, under our Ally Dealer Rewards Program, dealers benefit in certain circumstances from wholesale-floorplan-financing incentives, which we credit and account for as a reduction to interest income in the period they are earned.\nUnder our wholesale-floorplan-financing agreement, a dealership is generally required to pay the principal amount financed for a vehicle within a specified number of days following the dealership's sale or lease of the vehicle. The agreement also affords us the right to demand payment of all amounts owed under the wholesale credit line at any time. We, however, generally make this demand only if we terminate the credit line, the dealer defaults, or a risk-based reason exists to do so.\nCommercial Wholesale Financing Volume\nThe following table presents the percentage of average balance of our commercial wholesale floorplan finance receivables, in dollars, by product type and by channel.\n\nAverage commercial wholesale financing receivables outstanding decreased $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of GM dealer relationships due to the competitive environment across the automotive lending market and reduced dealer inventory levels, partially offset by higher average vehicle prices. Dealer inventory levels are dependent on a number of factors, including manufacturer production schedules and vehicle mix, sales incentives, and industry sales-all of which can influence future wholesale balances. Manufacturer production and corresponding dealer stock levels, as well as dealer penetration levels, may continue to influence our future wholesale balances during 2020.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOther Commercial Automotive Financing\nWe also provide other forms of commercial financing for the automotive industry including automotive dealer term and revolving loans and automotive fleet financing. Automotive dealer term and revolving loans are loans that we make to dealers to finance other aspects of the dealership business, including acquisitions. These loans are usually secured by real estate or other dealership assets and are typically personally guaranteed by the individual owners of the dealership. Additionally, we generally also have cross-collateral and cross-default provisions in place with dealers. Automotive fleet financing credit lines may be obtained by dealers, their affiliates, and other independent companies that are used to purchase vehicles, which they lease or rent to others. The average balances of other commercial automotive loans decreased 6% to $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nServicing and Monitoring\nWe service all of the wholesale credit lines in our portfolio and the wholesale automotive finance receivables that we have securitized. A statement setting forth billing and account information is distributed on a monthly basis to each dealer. Interest and other nonprincipal charges are billed in arrears and are required to be paid immediately upon receipt of the monthly billing statement. Generally, dealers remit payments to us through ACH transactions initiated by the dealer through a secure web application.\nWe manage risk related to wholesale floorplan financing by assessing dealership borrowers using a proprietary model based on various factors, including their capital sufficiency, operating performance, and credit and payment history. This model assigns dealership borrowers a risk rating that affects the amount of the line of credit and the ongoing risk management of the account. We monitor the level of borrowing under each dealer's credit line daily. We may adjust the dealer's credit line if warranted, based on the dealership's vehicle sales rate, and temporarily suspend the granting of additional credit, or take other actions following evaluation and analysis of the dealer's financial condition.\nWe periodically inspect and verify the existence of dealer vehicle inventories. The timing of these collateral audits varies, and no advance notice is given to the dealer. Among other things, audits are intended to assess dealer compliance with the financing agreement and confirm the status of our collateral.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nInsurance\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of our Insurance operations. The amounts presented are before the elimination of balances and transactions with our other reportable segments.\n\nn/m = not meaningful\n (a) Includes interest expense of $79 million, $67 million, and $50 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. \n (b) Includes net unrealized gains of $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net unrealized losses of $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. These net unrealized gains and losses are included in net income as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018. \n (c) Management uses a combined ratio as a primary measure of underwriting profitability. Underwriting profitability is indicated by a combined ratio under 100% and is calculated as the sum of all incurred losses and expenses (excluding interest and income tax expense) divided by the total of premiums and service revenues earned and other income.  2019 Compared to 2018\nOur Insurance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $315 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by $88 million of net unrealized gains on investments due to favorable market conditions within our equity portfolio, compared to net unrealized losses of $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInsurance premiums and service revenue earned was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to vehicle inventory insurance portfolio growth and rate increases.\nInsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled $321 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $295 million in 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by vehicle inventory insurance portfolio growth and higher VSC, GAP, and other policies in force. Total acquisition and underwriting expense increased $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to an increase in insurance commissions expense, driven by growth in our written insurance premiums and service revenue. Growth in insurance premiums and service revenue earned outpaced expense increases, which led to a decrease in the combined ratio to 92.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 92.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. In April 2019, we renewed our annual reinsurance program and continue to utilize this coverage to manage our risk of weather-related loss.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nPremium and Service Revenue Written\nThe following table summarizes premium and service revenue written by product, net of premiums ceded to reinsurers. VSC and GAP revenue are earned over the life of the service contract on a basis proportionate to the anticipated cost pattern. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this revenue stream.\n\n (a) Other products include VMCs, ClearGuard, and other ancillary products. \n (b) P&C insurance include vehicle inventory insurance and dealer ancillary products.  Insurance premiums and service revenue written was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.2 billion in 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to vehicle inventory insurance portfolio growth and rate increases, and higher vehicle service contract volume.\nCash and Investments\nA significant aspect of our Insurance operations is the investment of proceeds from premiums and other revenue sources. We use these investments to satisfy our obligations related to future claims at the time these claims are settled. Our Insurance operations have an Investment Committee, which develops guidelines and strategies for these investments. The guidelines established by this committee reflect our risk appetite, liquidity requirements, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors.\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our Insurance operations cash and investment portfolio at fair value.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nMortgage Finance\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the activities of our Mortgage Finance operations. The amounts presented are before the elimination of balances and transactions with our reportable segments.\n\nn/m = not meaningful\n2019 Compared to 2018\nOur Mortgage Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to higher prepayment activity, an increase in provision for loan losses, and higher noninterest expense driven primarily by continued asset growth. The decrease was partially offset by growth in our mortgage loan portfolio and an increase in the net gain on sale of mortgage loans.\nNet financing revenue and other interest income was $171 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $179 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to accelerated premium amortization on purchased loans due to higher prepayment activity driven by a lower interest rate environment, partially offset by increased loan balances as a result of bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans and direct-to-consumer originations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased $3.5 billion of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties and originated $2.0 billion of mortgage loans held-for-investment, compared to $4.4 billion and $401 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain on sale of mortgage loans, net, was $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by higher direct-to-consumer mortgage originations and the subsequent sale of these loans to our fulfillment provider, and the execution of whole-loan sales during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we originated $738 million of loans held-for-sale compared to $302 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of reserve releases for the year ended December 31, 2018, that did not reoccur.\nTotal noninterest expense was $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by continued asset growth.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the total unpaid principal balance (UPB) of purchases and originations of consumer mortgages held-for-investment, by FICO\u00ae Score at the time of acquisition.\n\nThe following table presents the net UPB, net UPB as a percentage of total, weighted-average coupon (WAC), premium net of discounts, LTV, and FICO\u00ae Scores for the products in our Mortgage Finance held-for-investment loan portfolio.\n\n (a) Represents UPB, net of charge-offs. \n (b) Updated home values were derived using a combination of appraisals, broker price opinions, automated valuation models, and metropolitan statistical area level house price indices. \n (c) Updated to reflect changes in credit score since loan origination. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nCorporate Finance\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the activities of our Corporate Finance operations. The amounts presented are before the elimination of balances and transactions with our reportable segments.\n\nn/m = not meaningful\n2019 Compared to 2018\nOur Corporate Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $153 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due primarily to higher net financing revenue and other interest income resulting from higher asset levels, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses recognized during the first quarter of 2019.\nNet financing revenue and other interest income was $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $204 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the growth of our loan portfolio, represented by a 23% increase in the gross carrying value of finance receivables and loans. Growth in the portfolio was primarily driven by asset-based lending, including our lender finance vertical, which provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct lending activities.\nOther revenue was $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by higher unrealized losses on equity securities in 2018, partially offset by lower fee income.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by higher reserves associated with favorable credit ratings migration in 2018 and portfolio growth, as well as a $6 million recovery of a previously charged-off loan recognized during the second quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur.\nTotal noninterest expense was $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $86 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense and other noninterest costs associated with growth in the business.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nCredit Portfolio\nThe following table presents loans held-for-sale, the gross carrying value of finance receivables and loans outstanding, unfunded commitments to lend, and total serviced loans of our Corporate Finance operations.\n\n (a) Includes unused revolving credit line commitments for loans held-for-sale and finance receivables and loans, signed commitment letters, and standby letter of credit facilities, which are issued on behalf of clients and may contingently require us to make payments to a third-party beneficiary in the event of a draw by the beneficiary thereunder. As many of these commitments are subject to borrowing base agreements and other restrictive covenants or may expire without being fully drawn, the stated amounts of these unfunded commitments are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements.

The increase in total financing revenue and other interest income from our investment securities portfolio and higher other revenue was more than offset by higher funding costs from higher market rates and deposit growth.\nFinancing revenue and other interest income was $960 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $815 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by growth in the size of the investment portfolio and higher interest and dividends from investment securities, primarily as a result of higher balances.\nTotal interest expense was $932 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $631 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased interest on deposits resulting from higher market rates and deposit growth, partially offset by a decrease in higher-cost secured and unsecured debt borrowings.\nTotal other revenue was $171 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $119 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased realized investment gains, partially offset by lower income related to certain equity hedges, and lower commission revenues.\nTotal assets were $36.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $34.0 billion as of December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily the result of growth in our available-for-sale securities portfolio. The increase was partially offset by a decline in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio and the continued runoff of our legacy mortgage portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the gross carrying value of the legacy mortgage portfolio was $1.1 billion, compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018.\nCash and Securities\nThe following table summarizes the composition of the cash and securities portfolio at fair value for Corporate and Other.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAlly Invest\nAlly Invest is our digital brokerage and wealth management offering, which enables us to complement our competitive deposit products with low-cost and commission-free investing. The following table presents trading days and average customer trades per day, the number of funded accounts, total net customer assets, and total customer cash balances as of the end of each of the last five quarters.\n\n (a) Represents the number of days the New York Stock Exchange and other U.S. stock exchange markets are open for trading. A half day represents a day when the U.S. markets close early. \n (b) Represents open and funded brokerage accounts.  Total funded accounts were flat from the prior quarter, and increased 15% from the fourth quarter of 2018, as our expenditures with third party marketing channels moderated during the fourth quarter of 2019. Average customer trades per day increased from the prior quarter, primarily due to customer behavior trends and market dynamics. Additionally, net customer assets increased in the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of equity market appreciation.\nThe competitive environment in the wealth management industry continues to evolve and more recently has led to changes in pricing models of industry participants. Consistent with recent industry developments, on October 4, 2019, Ally Invest announced that it would offer commission-free trading for its customers, effective October 9, 2019. Following these developments, we reassessed the goodwill associated with Ally Invest for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019 and, based on a revised valuation analysis of the business, concluded that goodwill was not impaired.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nRisk Management\nManaging the risk/reward trade-off is a fundamental component of operating our businesses, and all employees are responsible for managing risk.

Our primary types of risk include the following:\n \u2022 Credit risk - The risk of loss arising from an obligor not meeting its contractual obligations to us. \n \u2022 Insurance/underwriting risk - The risk of loss or of adverse change in the value of insurance liabilities, due to inadequate pricing and provisioning assumptions. \n \u2022 Liquidity risk - The risk that our financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions. Refer to discussion in the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital within this MD&A. \n \u2022 Market risk - The risk that movements in market variables such as benchmark interest rates, investors' required risk premium, foreign-exchange rates, equity prices, and used car prices may adversely affect our earnings, capital, or economic value. Market risk includes interest rate risk, investment risk, and lease residual risk. \n \u2022 Business/strategic risk - The risk resulting from the pursuit of business plans that turn out to be unsuccessful due to a variety of factors. \n \u2022 Reputation risk - The risk arising from negative public opinion on our business practices, whether true or not, that could cause a decline in the customer base, litigation, or revenue reductions. \n \u2022 Operational risk - The risk of loss or harm arising from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors, or external events. \n \u2022 Information technology/security risk - The risk resulting from the failure of, or insufficiency in, information technology (for example, a system outage) or intentional or accidental unauthorized access, sharing, removal, tampering, or disposal of company and customer data or records. \n \u2022 Compliance risk - The risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to the banking organization (applicable rules and standards). \n \u2022 Conduct risk - The risk of customer harm, employee harm, reputational damage, regulatory sanction, or financial loss resulting from the behavior of our employees and contractors toward customers, counterparties, other employees and contractors, or the markets in which we operate.  Our risk-governance structure starts within each business line, including committees established to oversee risk in their respective areas. The business lines are responsible for their risk-based performance and compliance with risk-management policies and applicable law.\nThe independent risk-management function is accountable for independently identifying, monitoring, measuring, and reporting on our various risks and for designing an effective risk-management framework and structure. The independent risk-management function is also responsible for developing, maintaining, and implementing enterprise risk-management policies. In addition, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) is responsible for supporting the Chief Risk Officer's oversight of senior management's responsibility to execute on our strategy within our risk appetite set by the RC, and the Chief Risk Officer's implementation of our independent risk-management program. The Chief Risk Officer reports to the RC, as well as administratively to the Chief Executive Officer.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAll business lines are subject to full and unrestricted audits by Audit Services. The Chief Audit Executive reports to the Audit Committee of our Board (AC), as well as administratively to the Chief Executive Officer, and is primarily responsible for assisting the AC in fulfilling its governance and oversight responsibilities. Audit Services is granted free and unrestricted access to any and all of our records, physical properties, technologies, management, and employees.\nIn addition, our Loan Review Group provides an independent assessment of the quality of our extensions of credit and credit-risk-management practices, and all business lines that create or influence credit risk are subject to full and unrestricted reviews by the Loan Review Group. This group is also granted free and unrestricted access to any and all of our records, physical properties, technologies, management and employees, and reports directly to the RC.\nLoan and Operating Lease Exposure\nThe following table summarizes the exposures from our loan and operating-lease activities.\n\n (a) Includes $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion of consumer mortgage loans in our legacy mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. \n (b) Represents the current balance of conforming mortgages originated directly to the held-for-sale portfolio. \n (c) Represents the current unpaid principal balance of outstanding loans, which are subject to our customary representation, warranty, and covenant provisions.  The risks inherent in our loan and operating lease exposures are largely driven by changes in the overall economy, used vehicle and housing prices, unemployment levels, and their impact on our borrowers. The potential financial statement impact of these exposures varies depending on the accounting classification and future expected disposition strategy. We retain the majority of our consumer automotive loans as they complement our core business model, but we do sell loans from time to time on an opportunistic basis. We ultimately manage the associated risks based on the underlying economics of the exposure. Our operating lease residual risk may be more volatile than credit risk in stressed macroeconomic scenarios. While all operating leases are exposed to potential reductions in used vehicle values, only loans where we take possession of the vehicle are affected by potential reductions in used vehicle values.\n \u2022 Finance receivables and loans - Loans that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity, or loans associated with an on-balance-sheet securitization classified as secured borrowing. Finance receivables and loans are reported at their gross carrying value, which includes the principal amount outstanding, net of unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, unamortized premiums and discounts on purchased loans, unamortized basis adjustments arising from the designation of finance receivables and loans as the hedged item in qualifying fair value hedge relationships, and cumulative principal charge-offs. We refer to the gross carrying value less the allowance for loan loss as the net carrying value in finance receivables and loans. We manage the economic risks of these exposures, including credit risk, by adjusting underwriting standards and risk limits, augmenting our servicing and collection activities (including loan modifications and restructurings), and optimizing \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nour product and geographic concentrations. Additionally, we may elect to account for certain loans at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these loans are recognized in a valuation allowance separate from the allowance for loan losses and are reflected in current period earnings. We use market-based instruments, such as derivatives, to hedge changes in the fair value of these loans.\n \u2022 Loans held-for-sale - Loans that we do not have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity. These loans are recorded on our balance sheet at the lower of their net carrying value or fair market value and are evaluated by portfolio and product type. Changes in the recorded value are recognized in a valuation allowance and reflected in current period earnings. We manage the economic risks of these exposures, including market and credit risks, in various ways including the use of market-based instruments, such as derivatives. \n \u2022 Off-balance-sheet securitized loans - Loans that we transfer off-balance sheet to nonconsolidated variable interest entities. Our exposure is primarily limited to customary representation, warranty, and covenant provisions. Similar to finance receivables and loans, we manage the economic risks of these exposures through activities including servicing and collections. \n \u2022 Whole-loan sales - Loans that we transfer off-balance sheet to third-party investors. Our exposure is primarily limited to customary representation, warranty and covenant provisions. Similar to finance receivables and loans, we manage the economic risks of these exposures through activities including servicing and collections. \n \u2022 Operating lease assets - The net book value of the automotive assets we lease includes the expected residual values upon remarketing the vehicles at the end of the lease and is reported net of accumulated depreciation. We are exposed to fluctuations in the expected residual value upon remarketing the vehicle at the end of the lease, and as such at contract inception, we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle. This evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model, which includes variables such as age, expected mileage, seasonality, segment factors, vehicle type, economic indicators, production cycle, automotive manufacturer incentives, and shifts in used vehicle supply. This internally generated data is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. Periodically, we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense appropriately over the remaining life of the contract. At termination, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense. The balance sheet reflects both the operating lease asset as well as any associated rent receivables. The operating lease rent receivable is accrued when collection is reasonably assured and presented as a component of other assets. The operating lease asset is reviewed for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  Refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates within this MD&A and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from an obligor not meeting its contractual obligations to us. Credit risk includes consumer credit risk, commercial credit risk, and counterparty credit risk.\nCredit risk is a major source of potential economic loss to us. Credit risk is monitored by the risk committees, executive leadership team, and our associates. Together, they oversee credit decisioning, account servicing activities, and credit-risk-management processes, and manage credit risk exposures within our risk appetite. In addition, our Loan Review Group provides an independent assessment of the quality of our credit portfolios and credit-risk-management practices, and reports its findings to the RC on a regular basis.\nTo mitigate risk, we have implemented specific policies and practices across business lines, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative analyses. This reflects our commitment to maintaining an independent and ongoing assessment of credit risk and credit quality. Our policies require an objective and timely assessment of the overall quality of the consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios. This includes the identification of relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolios, segments of the portfolios that are potential problem areas, loans and operating leases with potential credit weaknesses, and the assessment of the adequacy of internal credit risk policies and procedures. Our consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios are subject to regular stress tests that are based on plausible, but unexpected, economic scenarios to assess how the portfolios may perform in a severe economic downturn. In addition, we establish and maintain underwriting policies and limits across our portfolios and higher risk segments (for example, nonprime) based on our risk appetite.\nAnother important aspect to managing credit risk involves the need to carefully monitor and manage the performance and pricing of our loan products with the aim of generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns. When considering pricing, various granular risk-based factors are considered such as expected loss rates, loss volatility, anticipated operating costs, and targeted returns on equity. We carefully monitor credit losses and trends in credit losses relative to expected credit losses at contract inception. We closely monitor our loan performance and profitability in light of forecasted economic conditions and manage credit risk and expectations of losses in the portfolio.\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, the source of repayment, the underlying collateral, and current market conditions. We monitor the credit risk profile of individual borrowers, various segmentations (for example, geographic region, product type, industry segment), as well as the aggregate portfolio. We perform quarterly analyses of the consumer automotive, consumer mortgage, consumer other, and commercial portfolios using a range of indicators to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on historical and current trends. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAdditionally, we utilize numerous collection strategies to mitigate loss and provide ongoing support to customers in financial distress. For consumer automotive loans, we work with customers when they become delinquent on their monthly payment. In lieu of repossessing their vehicle, we may offer several types of assistance to aid our customers based on their willingness and ability to repay their loan. Loss mitigation may include payment extensions and rewrites of the loan terms. For mortgage loans, as part of certain programs, we offer mortgage loan modifications to qualified borrowers. These programs are in place to provide support to our mortgage customers in financial distress, including principal forgiveness, maturity extensions, delinquent interest capitalization, and changes to contractual interest rates.\nFurthermore, we manage our credit exposure to financial counterparties based on the risk profile of the counterparty. Within our policies we have established standards and requirements for managing counterparty risk exposures in a safe and sound manner. Counterparty credit risk is derived from multiple exposure types including derivatives, securities trading, securities financing transactions, financial futures, cash balances (for example, due from depository institutions, restricted accounts, and cash equivalents), and investment in debt securities. For more information on derivative counterparty credit risk, refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe employ an internal team of economists to enhance our planning and forecasting capabilities. This team conducts industry and market research, monitors economic risks, and helps support various forms of scenario planning. This group closely monitors macroeconomic trends given the nature of our business and the potential impacts on our exposure to credit risk. During 2019, the U.S. economy continued to modestly expand, led by consumer spending. The labor market remained robust during the year, with the unemployment rate at 3.5% as of December 31, 2019. Within the U.S. automotive market, new light vehicle sales have moderated from both historic highs and year-over-year pace, to a total of 17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect to experience modest downward pressure on used vehicle values during 2020.\nConsumer Credit Portfolio\nOur consumer loan portfolio primarily consists of automotive loans, first-lien mortgages, home equity loans and personal loans. Loan losses in our consumer loan portfolio are influenced by general business and economic conditions including unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings, and home and used vehicle prices. Additionally, our consumer credit exposure is significantly concentrated in automotive lending.\nCredit risk management for the consumer loan portfolio begins with the initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit life cycle. We manage consumer credit risk through our loan origination and underwriting policies and the credit approval process. We use proprietary credit-scoring models to differentiate the expected default rates of credit applicants enabling us to better evaluate credit applications for approval and to tailor the pricing and financing structure according to this assessment of credit risk. We continuously monitor and routinely update the inputs of the credit scoring models. These and other actions mitigate but do not eliminate credit risk. Ineffective evaluations of a borrower's creditworthiness, fraud, or changes in the applicant's financial condition after approval could negatively affect the quality of our portfolio, resulting in loan losses.\nOur servicing activities are another important factor in managing consumer credit risk. Servicing activities consist of collecting and processing customer payments, responding to customer concerns and inquiries, processing customer requests (including those for payoff quotes, total-loss handling, and payment modifications), maintaining a perfected security interest in the financed vehicle, engaging in collections activity, and disposing of off-lease and repossessed vehicles. Servicing activities are generally consistent across our Automotive Finance operations; however, certain practices may be influenced by state laws.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the credit performance of the consumer loan portfolio reflected our underwriting strategy to originate a diversified portfolio of consumer automotive loan assets, including new, used, prime and nonprime finance receivables and loans, as well as high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans that are acquired through bulk loan purchases and direct-to-consumer mortgage originations. We also further diversified our consumer portfolio to include personal lending through the acquisition of Health Credit Services during the fourth quarter of 2019. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses represented approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019, compared to approximately 11.7% at December 31, 2018. For information on our consumer credit risk practices and policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, and charge-offs, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table includes consumer finance receivables and loans recorded at gross carrying value.\n\n (a) Includes nonaccrual TDR loans of $252 million and $257 million at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. \n (b) Loans are generally in nonaccrual status when principal or interest has been delinquent for 90 days or more, or when full collection is not expected. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting policies for finance receivables and loans. \n (c) Certain finance receivables and loans are included in fair value hedging relationships. Refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n (d) Includes outstanding CSG loans of $8.2 billion and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, and RV loans of $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. \n (e) Excludes $11 million of finance receivables at December 31, 2019, for which we have elected the fair value option.  Total consumer finance receivables and loans increased $2.7 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with December 31, 2018. The increase consists of $1.9 billion of consumer automotive finance receivables and loans, $621 million of consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans, and $201 million of consumer other finance receivables and loans. The increase in consumer automotive finance receivables and loans was primarily related to continued momentum in our used vehicle lending. The increase in consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans was primarily due to the execution of bulk loan purchases totaling $3.5 billion and direct-to-consumer held-for-investment originations of $2.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. These increases were partially offset by portfolio run-off and the transfer of $940 million of consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans to held-for-sale, of which $864 million were sold during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in consumer other finance receivables and loans was due to the acquisition of Health Credit Services during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nTotal consumer nonperforming finance receivables and loans at December 31, 2019, increased $78 million to $821 million from December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase of $98 million of consumer automotive finance receivables and loans and a decrease of $22 million of consumer mortgage nonperforming finance receivables and loans. The increase in nonperforming consumer automotive finance receivables and loans was primarily due to higher delinquency rates as part of our continued diversification strategy and as a result of portfolio growth. The increase was also modestly impacted by a brief scheduled moratorium on all collections and repossession activities at the end of 2019 prior to the conversion to a new servicing and accounting technology platform during the first quarter of 2020. The decrease in nonperforming consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans was driven by the continued run-off of our legacy mortgage portfolio. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Nonperforming consumer finance receivables and loans as a percentage of total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans were 0.9% at both December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018.\nTotal consumer TDRs outstanding at December 31, 2019, increased $20 million since December 31, 2018, to $746 million. Results reflect a $42 million increase in our consumer automotive loan portfolio, largely offset by a $22 million decrease in our consumer mortgage loan portfolio, driven by our legacy mortgage portfolio. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nConsumer automotive loans accruing and past due 30 days or more increased $115 million to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018, driven by growth in the overall size of the consumer automotive loan portfolio, as well as higher delinquency rates as part of our continued diversification strategy.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table includes consumer net charge-offs from finance receivables and loans at gross carrying value and related ratios.\n\n (a) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding finance receivables and loans excluding loans measured at fair value and loans held-for-sale during the period for each loan category.  Our net charge-offs from total consumer finance receivables and loans were $927 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $937 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by our consumer mortgage loan portfolio where we experienced strong credit performance as the legacy mortgage portfolio continues to run-off and we continue to grow our Mortgage Finance business. Net charge-offs for our consumer automotive portfolio increased slightly by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Results were primarily driven by the relatively consistent credit profile of our consumer automotive loan portfolio which experienced strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting and higher recoveries. Additionally, we experienced a modest reduction in net charge-offs due to a brief scheduled moratorium on all collections and repossession activities at the end of 2019 prior to the conversion to a new servicing and accounting technology platform during the first quarter of 2020.\nThe following table summarizes total consumer loan originations for the periods shown. Total consumer loan originations include loans classified as finance receivables and loans and loans held-for-sale during the period.\n\n (a) Excludes bulk loan purchases associated with our Mortgage Finance operations, and includes $738 million and $302 million of loans originated as held-for-sale for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. \n (b) Amounts relate to originations from our Ally Lending business, following the acquisition of Health Credit Services during the fourth quarter of 2019.  Total consumer loan originations increased $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase of $2.0 billion of consumer mortgage loans and an increase of $585 million of consumer automotive loans. The increase in consumer mortgage loan originations for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to growth in the direct-to-consumer mortgage business. The increase in consumer automotive loan originations for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to higher used vehicle volume.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table shows the percentage of consumer automotive and consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans by state concentration based on gross carrying value. Total consumer automotive loans were $72.4 billion and $70.5 billion at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Total consumer mortgage loans were $17.3 billion and $16.7 billion at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively.\n\n (a) Presentation is in descending order as a percentage of total consumer finance receivables and loans at December 31, 2019.  We monitor our consumer loan portfolio for concentration risk across the states in which we lend. The highest concentrations of consumer loans are in California and Texas, which represented an aggregate of 24.9% and 25.4% of our total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Our consumer mortgage loan portfolio concentration within California, which is primarily composed of high-quality jumbo mortgage loans, generally aligns to the California share of jumbo mortgages nationally.\nRepossessed and Foreclosed Assets\nWe classify an asset as repossessed or foreclosed, which is included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, when physical possession of the collateral is taken. We dispose of the acquired collateral in a timely fashion in accordance with regulatory requirements. For more information on repossessed and foreclosed assets, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRepossessed consumer automotive loan assets in our Automotive Finance operations increased $11 million from December 31, 2018, to $147 million at December 31, 2019. Foreclosed mortgage assets decreased $2 million from December 31, 2018, to $9 million at December 31, 2019.\nCommercial Credit Portfolio\nOur commercial portfolio consists primarily of automotive loans through the extension of wholesale floorplan financing, automotive dealer term real estate loans, and automotive fleet financing, as well as other commercial loans including our Corporate Finance lending portfolio. Wholesale floorplan loans are secured by the vehicles financed (and all other vehicle inventory), which provides strong collateral protection in the event of dealership default. Additional collateral (for example, a blanket lien over all dealership assets) or other credit enhancements (for example, personal guarantees from dealership owners) are typically obtained to further mitigate credit risk. Furthermore, in some cases, we may benefit from situations where an automotive manufacturer repurchases vehicles. These repurchases may serve as an additional layer of protection in the event of repossession of new-vehicle dealership inventory or dealership franchise termination.\nWithin our commercial portfolio, we utilize proprietary risk rating models that are fundamental to managing credit risk exposure consistently across various types of commercial borrowers and captures critical risk factors for each borrower. The ratings are used for many areas of credit risk management, including loan origination, portfolio risk monitoring, management reporting, and loan loss reserves analyses. Therefore, the rating systems are critical to an effective and consistent credit-risk-management framework.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the credit performance of the commercial portfolio remained strong as nonperforming finance receivables and loans decreased, and our net charge-offs remained low. For information on our commercial credit risk practices and policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, and charge-offs, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table includes total commercial finance receivables and loans reported at gross carrying value.\n\n (a) Includes nonaccrual TDR loans of $114 million and $86 million at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. \n (b) Loans are generally in nonaccrual status when principal or interest has been delinquent for 90 days or more, or when full collection is not expected. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting policies for finance receivables and loans. \n (c) Other commercial and industrial primarily includes senior secured commercial lending largely associated with our Corporate Finance operations.  Total commercial finance receivables and loans outstanding decreased $4.4 billion from December 31, 2018, to $38.3 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of GM dealer relationships due to the competitive environment across the automotive lending market and reduced dealer inventory levels. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Corporate Finance portfolio that was primarily driven by asset-based lending, including our lender finance vertical, which provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct lending activities.\nTotal commercial nonperforming finance receivables and loans were $215 million at December 31, 2019, reflecting a decrease of $134 million when compared to December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to reduced exposure to one large automotive dealer group that was placed into default in the fourth quarter of 2018. Nonperforming commercial finance receivables and loans as a percentage of outstanding commercial finance receivables and loans decreased to 0.6% at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.8% at December 31, 2018.\nTotal commercial TDRs outstanding at December 31, 2019, increased $35 million since December 31, 2018, to $121 million, reflecting an increase of $20 million in our Corporate Finance portfolio and an increase of $15 million in our commercial automotive portfolio. The increase in our Corporate Finance portfolio was primarily driven by three accounts being classified as TDRs, partially offset by the partial liquidation and charge-off of two accounts. The increase in our commercial automotive portfolio was primarily driven by TDRs involving one large automotive dealer group that was placed into default in the fourth quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe following table includes total commercial net charge-offs from finance receivables and loans at gross carrying value and related ratios.\n\n (a) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding finance receivables and loans excluding loans measured at fair value and loans held-for-sale during the period for each loan category.  Our net charge-offs from total commercial finance receivables and loans were $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net charge-offs of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by partial charge-offs of four exposures within our Corporate Finance portfolio, as well as three accounts within our commercial automotive portfolio. Charge-off activity during 2019 was in line with expectations for these businesses.\nCommercial Real Estate\nThe commercial real estate portfolio consists of finance receivables and loans issued primarily to automotive dealers. Commercial real estate finance receivables and loans were $5.0 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the percentage of total commercial real estate finance receivables and loans by state concentration based on gross carrying value.\n\nCommercial Criticized Exposure\nFinance receivables and loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful are reported as criticized. These classifications are based on regulatory definitions and generally represent finance receivables and loans within our portfolio that have a higher default risk or have already defaulted. These finance receivables and loans require additional monitoring and review including specific actions to mitigate our potential loss.\nTotal criticized exposures increased $251 million from December 31, 2018, to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the downgrade of two dealership groups in December.\nThe following table presents the percentage of total commercial criticized finance receivables and loans by industry concentration based on gross carrying value.\n\nSelected Loan Maturity and Sensitivity Data\nThe table below shows the maturity of the commercial finance receivables and loans portfolio and the distribution between fixed and floating interest rates based on the stated terms of the commercial loan agreements. This portfolio is reported at gross carrying value.\n\n (a) Includes loans with revolving terms (for example, wholesale floorplan loans). \n (b) Loan maturities are based on the remaining maturities under contractual terms. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe following tables present an analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses on finance receivables and loans.\n\n (a) Represents the amount of the gross carrying value directly written off. For consumer and commercial loans, the loss from a charge-off is measured as the difference between the gross carrying value of a loan and the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our charge-off policies. \n (b) Coverage percentages are based on the allowance for loan losses related to finance receivables and loans excluding those loans held at fair value as a percentage of the gross carrying value. \n (c) Ratios for the consumer other portfolio segment are presented on an annualized basis, as a result of our acquisition of Health Credit Services on October 1, 2019. Refer to Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\n (a) Represents the amount of the gross carrying value directly written off. For consumer and commercial loans, the loss from a charge-off is measured as the difference between the gross carrying value of a loan and the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our charge-off policies. \n (b) Primarily related to the transfer of finance receivables and loans from held-for-investment to held-for-sale. \n (c) Coverage percentages are based on the allowance for loan losses related to finance receivables and loans excluding those loans held at fair value as a percentage of the gross carrying value.  The allowance for consumer loan losses at December 31, 2019, increased $29 million compared to December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase of $27 million in the consumer automotive allowance and an increase of $9 million in the consumer other allowance due to the acquisition of Health Credit Services, partially offset by a decrease of $7 million in the consumer mortgage allowance. The increase in our consumer automotive allowance was primarily driven by portfolio growth as finance receivable balances are up $1.9 billion compared to\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\n2018. The decrease in the consumer mortgage allowance was primarily driven by overall lower net charge-offs resulting from legacy mortgage portfolio run-off and strong credit performance, partially offset by year-over-year growth of $1.0 billion in our Mortgage Finance receivables portfolio.\nThe allowance for commercial loan losses declined $8 million at December 31, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by our commercial automotive portfolio due to lower reserves associated with a decrease of $5.4 billion in finance receivable balances. Overall credit performance in our commercial portfolios remains stable.\nAllowance for Loan Losses by Type\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by product type.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe following table summarizes the provision for loan losses by product type.\n\nThe provision for consumer loan losses was $958 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $896 million for year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in provision for loan losses was primarily driven by reserve\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nreductions during the year ended December 31, 2018, associated with hurricane activity experienced during 2017 in our consumer automotive loan portfolio. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment, as well as continued disciplined underwriting and higher recoveries. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2019, provision expense was incurred in our consumer other portfolio due to the acquisition of Health Credit Services. The provision for consumer mortgage loan losses increased $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by reserve releases for the year ended December 31, 2018, that did not repeat, partially offset by lower net charge-offs as the legacy mortgage portfolio continues to run-off. We continue to experience strong overall credit performance in our consumer mortgage portfolio.\nThe provision for commercial loan losses increased $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by our Corporate Finance portfolio which experienced higher reserves associated with favorable credit ratings migration in 2018 and portfolio growth, as well as a $6 million recovery of a previously charged-off loan recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018, that did not reoccur. Overall credit performance in the Corporate Finance portfolio remains stable.\nImplementation of CECL\nAlly will adopt CECL on January 1, 2020, as further described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon implementation of CECL we expect to recognize a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance of approximately $1.0 billion, net of income tax, which reflects a pre-tax increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $1.3 billion. This increase is almost exclusively driven by our consumer automotive loan portfolio. We plan to phase in the day-one impact of CECL into regulatory capital in accordance with regulatory capital rules which permit us to phase in 25% of the impact of CECL in 2020 and an additional 25% each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2023. We estimate that the implementation of CECL will reduce our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio by 17 to 19 basis points during the first quarter of 2020.\nUnder CECL, our modeling process will incorporate the following considerations:\n \u2022 A single forecast scenario for macroeconomic factors incorporated into the modeling process; \n \u2022 A 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over a 24-month period; \n \u2022 Data from the historical mean will be calculated from January 2008 through the most current period which includes data points from the most recent recessionary period.  Insurance/Underwriting Risk\nThe underwriting of our VSCs, VMCs, GAP, and insurance policies includes an assessment of the risk to determine acceptability and categorization for appropriate pricing. The acceptability of a particular risk is based on expected losses, expenses and other factors specific to the product in question. With respect to VSCs, considerations include the quality of the vehicles produced, the price of replacement parts, repair labor rates, and new model introductions. Insurance risk also includes event risk, which is synonymous with pure risk, hazard risk, or insurance risk, and presents no chance of gain, only of loss.\nWe mitigate losses by the active management of claim settlement activities using experienced claims personnel and the evaluation of current period reported claims. Losses for these events may be compared to prior claims experience, expected claims, or loss expenses from similar incidents to assess the reasonableness of incurred losses.\nIn some instances, reinsurance is used to reduce the risk associated with volatile business lines, such as catastrophe risk in vehicle inventory insurance. Our vehicle inventory insurance product is covered by excess-of-loss protection, including catastrophe coverage for weather-related events. In addition, loss control techniques such as storm path monitoring to assist dealers in preparing for severe weather help to mitigate loss potential.\nIn accordance with industry and accounting practices and applicable insurance laws and regulatory requirements, we maintain reserves for reported losses, losses incurred but not reported, losses expected to be incurred in the future for contracts in force and loss adjustment expenses. The estimated values of our prior reported loss reserves and changes to the estimated values are routinely monitored by credentialed actuaries. Our reserve estimates are regularly reviewed by management; however, since the reserves are based on estimates and numerous assumptions, the ultimate liability may differ from the amount estimated.\nMarket Risk\nOur financing, investing, and insurance activities give rise to market risk, or the potential change in the value of our assets (including securities, assets held-for-sale, loans and operating leases) and liabilities (including deposits and debt) due to movements in market variables such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign-exchange rates, equity prices, and off-lease vehicle prices.\nThe impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on our assets and liabilities (interest rate risk) represents an exposure to market risk. We primarily use interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate risk exposure.\nThe fair value of our credit-sensitive assets is also exposed to credit spread risk. Credit spread is the amount of additional return over the benchmark interest rates that an investor would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. Generally, an increase in credit spreads would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nWe are also exposed to foreign-currency risk arising from foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily in Canada. We enter into hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk.\nWe also have exposure to changes in the value of equity securities. We have exposure to equity securities with readily determinable fair values primarily related to our Insurance operations. For such equity securities, we use equity derivatives to manage our exposure to equity price fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed to changes in the value of other equity investments without readily determinable fair market values. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We may experience changes in the valuation of these investments, which may cause volatility in our earnings.\nThe composition of our balance sheet, including shorter-duration consumer automotive loans and variable-rate commercial loans, coupled with the continued funding shift toward retail deposits, partially mitigates market risk. Additionally, we maintain risk-management controls that measure and monitor market risk using a variety of analytical techniques including market value, sensitivity analysis, and value at risk models. Refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLIBOR Transition\nIn July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intent to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of LIBOR, it is expected that a transition away from the use of LIBOR to alternative benchmark rates will occur by the end of 2021.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR or LIBOR-based rates will present risks to our business, as further described in the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report. In recognition of these risks and uncertainties, we have established an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks that may arise from the potential discontinuation of LIBOR. Our program spans across impacted business lines and functions to evaluate risks associated with the transition, while taking into account specific considerations related to our customers, products and instruments, and counterparty exposures. Through this program, we continue to assess and plan for potential impacts to our existing and future contracts with customers and counterparties, financial forecasts, operational processes, technology, modeling, and vendor relationships. We also continue to evaluate effective communication strategies to employ with our stakeholders, including relevant customers, counterparties, and vendors.\nWe have exposure to LIBOR-based contracts within certain of our finance receivables and loans, primarily related to commercial automotive loans, corporate finance loans, and mortgage loans, as well as certain investment securities and derivative contracts, among other arrangements. Our commercial automotive loan portfolio is primarily composed of wholesale floorplan financing to automotive dealers. Currently, a significant portion of our wholesale floorplan finance receivables are invoiced utilizing a LIBOR-based reference rate and, as such, represents our largest exposure to LIBOR based on notional dollar amount. Smaller loan portfolios that utilize contracts containing LIBOR-based reference rates include our corporate finance held-for-investment loans and lending commitments, and our adjustable-rate mortgage loans. With respect to our liabilities, we have issued trust preferred securities with an interest rate linked to LIBOR and also have secured facilities, certain asset-backed securitizations, and brokered certificates of deposit that also contain LIBOR-based reference rates.\nWith respect to selecting an alternative benchmark, we continue to evaluate the most appropriate course of action for each instrument that currently references LIBOR as well as any future instruments that reference a benchmark. For example, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a group convened by the FRB, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed purchase transactions. We are evaluating SOFR, among other alternatives and actions, as a potential alternative reference rate to LIBOR, and are taking steps to assess the operational, financial, and various other impacts this change could have to our business. Additionally, we continue to evaluate inclusion of appropriate fallback provisions to our contracts to adequately address alternatives in the absence of LIBOR, including evaluating the fallback language proposed by the ARRC for certain contracts. We will continue to actively monitor industry developments and their potential impact to us.\nWe are also actively assessing how the discontinuation of LIBOR could impact accounting and financial reporting including, but not limited to, potential impacts to our hedge accounting, valuation or modeling, or impacts associated with modifying the terms of our loan agreements or debt instruments with our customers or counterparties. We also continue to monitor the activities of the standard setters such as the FASB, which has issued proposed guidance and new accounting standard updates that provide certain relief related to the transition away from LIBOR. For example, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes, which permits the use of the OIS rate based on the SOFR to be designated as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. In addition, the FASB has recently issued proposed guidance that would help ease the potential effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The proposed guidance would offer optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to modifications of certain contracts, hedging relationships, or other transactions that would be driven by reference rate reform. We anticipate this guidance will be issued as a final ASU in the first half of 2020.\nAlly recognizes the significance of LIBOR cessation, and has devoted numerous resources throughout all levels of the organization to actively identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with this transition. Our program is also subject to the governance and oversight of our Board through the RC and certain executive committees including the ALCO and the ERMC.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nFair Value Sensitivity Analysis\nThe following table presents a fair value sensitivity analysis of our assets and liabilities using isolated hypothetical movements in specific market rates. The analysis assumes adverse instantaneous, parallel shifts in market-exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and equity prices. Additionally, since only adverse fair value impacts are included, the natural offset between asset and liability rate sensitivities that arise within a diversified balance sheet, such as ours, may not be considered.\n\n (a) Refer to the section below titled Net Financing Revenue Sensitivity Analysis for information on the interest rate sensitivity of our financial instruments.  Net Financing Revenue Sensitivity Analysis\nInterest rate risk represents our most significant exposure to market risk. We actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings. We use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments.\nWe prepare forward-looking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth, asset/liability positioning, and interest rates based on the implied forward curve. The analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and non-contractual maturities. We continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing actions.\nSimulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast. The changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity. Our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets, liabilities, and off-balance-sheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities. Our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates.\nThe net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following 12 months. A number of alternative rate scenarios are tested, including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve. Management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types. Relative to our baseline forecast, which is based on the implied forward curve, our net financing revenue over the next 12 months would increase by $13 million if interest rates remain unchanged.\nThe following table presents the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net financing revenue over the next 12 months assuming 100 basis point and 200 basis point instantaneous parallel and gradual parallel shock increases, and assuming 100 basis point instantaneous parallel and gradual parallel shock decreases to the implied market forward curve as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018.\n\n (a) Gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over 12 months.  The implied forward rate curve was lower across all tenors compared to December 31, 2018, and includes one projected rate cut in the federal funds target rate in the forecast horizon. The impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections. As of December 31, 2019, our net interest income sensitivity in the +100 and +200 basis point instantaneous shock scenarios has primarily been impacted by a net decrease in pay-fixed interest rate swaps, partially offset by funding sources shifting from short-term market-based funding to deposits.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario has decreased as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to the lower pay-fixed interest rate swap notional referenced above as well as the addition of interest rate floor contracts, partially offset by increased mortgage prepayment risk in a lower interest rate environment.\nOur risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate debt instruments, and pay-fixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floating-rate debt instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we initiated a hedging program of interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floating-rate assets. The size, maturity, and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet, ALM objectives, and interest rate environment evolve over time.\nOperating Lease Residual Risk Management\nWe are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio. This operating lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be lower than the projection of these values used in establishing the pricing at lease inception. However, certain automotive manufacturers have provided their guarantee for portions of our residual exposure, as further described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operating lease portfolio, net of accumulated depreciation was $8.9 billion and $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. The expected lease residual value of our operating lease portfolio at scheduled termination was $7.2 billion and $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. For information on our valuation of automotive operating lease residuals including periodic revisions through adjustments to depreciation expense based on current and forecasted market conditions, refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates-Valuation of Automotive Operating Lease Assets and Residuals within this MD&A.\n \u2022 Priced residual value projections - At contract inception, we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle. This evaluation uses a proprietary model, which includes variables such as age, expected mileage, seasonality, segment factors, vehicle type, economic indicators, production cycle, automotive manufacturer incentives, and unanticipated shifts in used vehicle supply, as well as expert judgment. This internally generated data is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. Periodically, we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense over the remaining life of the contract as necessary. At termination, our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense. \n \u2022 Remarketing abilities - Our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and the proceeds realized from vehicle sales. Vehicles can be remarketed through auction (internet and physical), sale to dealer, sale to lessee, and other methods. The results within these channels vary, with physical auction typically resulting in the lowest-priced outcome. \n \u2022 Manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs - Automotive manufacturers influence operating lease residual results in the following ways: \n \u25e6 The brand image of automotive manufacturers and consumer demand for their products affects residual risk. \n \u25e6 Automotive manufacturer marketing programs may influence the used vehicle market for those vehicles through programs such as incentives on new vehicles, programs designed to encourage lessees to terminate their operating leases early in conjunction with the acquisition of a new vehicle (referred to as pull-ahead programs), and special rate used vehicle programs. \n \u2022 Used vehicle market - We have exposure to changes in used vehicle prices. General economic conditions, used vehicle supply and demand, and new vehicle market prices heavily influence used vehicle prices.  Operating Lease Vehicle Terminations and Remarketing\nThe following table summarizes the volume of operating lease terminations and average gain per vehicle, as well as our methods of vehicle sales at lease termination, stated as a percentage of total operating lease vehicle disposals.\n\nWe recognized an average gain per vehicle of $607 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $661 for 2018. The decrease in average gain per vehicle for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to a decline in used vehicle values\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nresulting from increased market supply, most notably during the fourth quarter of 2019. The number of off-lease vehicles remarketed during the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased 16% compared to 2018. The decrease in remarketing volume for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to the wind down of our legacy GM operating lease portfolio. We expect future termination volume to be more consistent with trends experienced during the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information on our investment in operating leases, refer to Note 1 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating Lease Portfolio Mix\nWe monitor the concentration of our outstanding operating leases. The following table presents the mix of operating lease assets by vehicle type, based on volume of units outstanding.\n\nAs a result of the runoff of our legacy GM operating lease portfolio, our exposure to Chrysler vehicles represented approximately 92% and 94% of our operating lease units as of December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nBusiness/Strategic Risk\nBusiness/strategic risk is embedded in every facet of our organization and is one of our primary risk types. It is the risk resulting from the pursuit of business activities that turn out to be unsuccessful due to a variety of both controllable and non-controllable factors. We aim to mitigate this risk within our business lines through portfolio diversification, product innovations, close monitoring of the execution of our strategic and capital plan, and ensuring flexibility of the cost base.\nAlly's strategic plan is reviewed and approved annually by our Board, as are the capital plan and financial business plan. With oversight by our Board, executive management seeks to consistently apply core operating principles while executing our strategic plan within the risk appetite approved by the RC. The executive management team continuously monitors business performance throughout the year to assess strategic risk and find early warning signals so that risks can be proactively managed. Executive management regularly reviews actual performance versus the plan, updates our Board via reporting routines, and implements changes as deemed appropriate.\nSignificant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and recovery and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by our Board as required. At the business level, as we introduce new products, we monitor their performance relative to expectations. With oversight by our Board, executive management evaluates changes to the financial forecast and risk, capital, and liquidity positions throughout the year.\nReputation Risk\nReputation risk is the risk arising from negative public opinion on our business practices, whether true or not, that could cause a decline in the customer base, litigation, or revenue reductions. Reputation risk may result from many of our activities, including those related to the management of our business/strategic, operational, and credit risks. We manage reputation risk through established policies and controls in our businesses and risk-management processes to mitigate reputation risks in a timely manner and through proactive monitoring and identification of potential reputation risk events. We have established processes and procedures to respond to events that give rise to reputation risk, including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion, external communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and informing key stakeholders of potential reputation risks. Primary responsibility for the identification, escalation, and resolution of reputation risk issues resides with our business lines. Each employee has an obligation, within the scope of their activities, to analyze and assess any imminent or intended transaction in terms of possible risk factors in order to minimize reputation risks. Further, Ally's strong LEAD\u201d culture and distinct Do it Right\u201d philosophy also strengthen our efforts to mitigate reputational risks by promoting a transparent culture where every associate is expected to act as a risk manager. Our culture is proactive with our core principles embedded at all levels of the organization so that any associate, at any time, can and should call attention to risks that need to be addressed and taken into account. Our organization and governance structures provide oversight of reputation risks, and key risk indicators are reported regularly and directly to management and the RC, which provide primary oversight of reputation risk.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss or harm arising from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors, or external events. Operational risk is an inherent risk element in all of our activities. Such risk can manifest in various ways, including errors, business interruptions, and inappropriate behavior of employees, and can potentially result in financial losses and other damage to us. Operational risk includes business disruption risk, fraud risk, human capital risk, legal risk, model risk, process execution and management risk, and supplier (third party) risk.\n \u2022 Business disruption risk - The risk of significant disruption to our operations resulting from natural disasters, external technology outages, or other external events. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\n \u2022 Fraud risk - The risk from deliberate misrepresentation or concealment of information material to a transaction with the intent to deceive another and that is reasonably relied on or used in decision making. Fraud can occur internally (for example, employees) or externally (for example, criminal activity, third-party suppliers). \n \u2022 Human capital risk - The risk caused by high turnover, inadequate or improper staffing levels, departure/unavailability of key personnel, or inadequate training and includes our exposure to worker's compensation and employment litigation. \n \u2022 Legal risk - The risk arising from the potential that unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments can disrupt or otherwise negatively affect our operations or condition. \n \u2022 Model risk - The potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model assumptions, inputs, outputs, and reports. This risk may include fundamental errors within the model that produce inaccurate outputs or that the model is used incorrectly or inappropriately. \n \u2022 Process execution and management risk - The risk caused by failure to execute or adhere to policies, standards, procedures, processes, controls, and activities as designed and documented. \n \u2022 Supplier (third party) risk - The risk associated with third-party suppliers and their delivery of products or services and effect on overall business performance. This includes a supplier's failure to comply with information technology requirements, information and physical security, laws, rules, regulations, and legal agreements.  To monitor and mitigate such risk, we maintain a system of policies and a control framework designed to provide a sound and well-controlled operational environment. This framework employs practices and tools designed to maintain risk identification, risk governance, risk and control assessment and testing, risk monitoring, and transparency through risk reporting mechanisms. The goal is to maintain operational risk at appropriate levels based on our financial strength, the characteristics of the businesses and the markets in which we operate, and the related competitive and regulatory environment.\nInformation Technology/Security Risk\nInformation technology/security risk includes risk resulting from the failure of, or insufficiency in, information technology (for example, a system outage) or intentional or accidental unauthorized access, sharing, removal, tampering, or disposal of company and customer data or records.\nWe and our service providers rely extensively on communications, data-management, and other operating systems and infrastructure to conduct our business and operations. Failures or disruptions to these systems or infrastructure from cyberattacks or other events may impede our ability to conduct business and operations and may result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, or other harm.\nWe and other financial institutions continue to be the target of various cyberattacks, including through the introduction of malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service, or other security breaches, as part of an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions or obtain confidential, proprietary, or other information or assets of the Company, our customers, employees, or other third parties with whom we transact.\nCybersecurity and the continued development of our controls, processes, and systems to protect our technology infrastructure, customer information, and other proprietary information or assets remain a critical and ongoing priority. We recognize that cyber-related risks continue to evolve and have become increasingly sophisticated, and as a result we continuously evaluate the adequacy of our preventive and detective measures.\nIn order to help mitigate cybersecurity risks, we devote substantial resources to protect the Company from cyber-related incidents. We regularly assess vulnerabilities and threats to our environment utilizing various resources including independent third-party assessments to evaluate whether our layered system of controls effectively mitigates risk. We also invest in new technologies and infrastructure in order to respond to evolving risks within our environment. We continue to partner with other industry peers in order to share knowledge and information to further our security environment and invest in training and employee awareness to cyber-related risks. Additionally, as a further protective measure, we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to terms and conditions, may cover certain aspects of cybersecurity and information risks; however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses. Management monitors operational metrics and data surrounding cybersecurity operations, and the organization monitors compliance with established limits in connection with our risk appetite. Senior leadership regularly reviews, questions, and challenges such information.\nThe RC reviews cybersecurity risks, incidents, and developments in connection with its oversight of our independent risk-management program. Our Board and the AC also undertake reviews as appropriate. The Information Technology Risk Committee is responsible for supporting the Chief Risk Officer's oversight of Ally's management of cybersecurity and other risks involving our communications, data-management, and other operating systems and infrastructure. Additionally, our cybersecurity program is regularly assessed by Audit Services, which reports directly to the AC. The business lines are also actively engaged in overseeing the service providers that supply or support the operating systems and infrastructure on which we depend and, with effective challenge from the independent risk-management function, managing related operational and other risks.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nNotwithstanding these risk and control initiatives, we may incur losses attributable to information technology/security risk from time to time, and there can be no assurance these losses will not be incurred in the future or will not be substantial. For further information on cybersecurity, technology, systems, and infrastructure, refer to the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we implemented a new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases that is utilized for customer servicing and financial reporting through the full lifecycle of these loans and leases. This new platform replaces our existing consumer automotive loan and lease technology platform and helps modernize our technology, enhance the flexibility and capabilities of the platform, and streamline aspects of our servicing operations. While this new platform will help us continue to expand our capabilities, there are inherent risks in implementing any new system such as this. We will continue to monitor the newly implemented platform to ensure the system is performing as expected.\nCompliance Risk\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to the banking organization (applicable rules and standards). Examples of such risks include compliance with regulations set forth by banking agencies including fair and responsible banking, anti-money laundering, or community reinvestment act, risks associated with offering our products or services, or risks associated with deviating from internal policies and procedures including those that are established to promote sound risk-management and internal-control practices. Compliance risk also includes fiduciary risk, which includes risks arising from our duty to exercise loyalty, act in the best interest of our clients, and care for assets according to an appropriate standard of care. This risk generally exists to the extent that we exercise discretion in managing assets on behalf of a customer.\nWe recognize that an effective compliance program, including driving a culture of compliance, plays a key role in managing and overseeing compliance risk, and that a proactive compliance environment and program are essential to help meet various legal, regulatory, or other requirements or expectations. To manage compliance risk, we maintain a system of policies, change-management protocols, control frameworks, and other formal governance structures designed to provide a holistic enterprise approach to managing such risks, which includes consideration of identifying, assessing, monitoring, and communicating compliance risks throughout the Company. Our compliance function provides independent, enterprise-wide oversight of compliance-risk exposures and related risk-management practices and is led by the Chief Compliance Officer who reports to our Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Compliance Officer has the authority and responsibility for the oversight and administration of our Enterprise Compliance Program, which includes ongoing reporting of significant compliance-related matters to our Board and various committees established to govern compliance-related risks. The Compliance Risk Management Committee, established by the Chief Compliance Officer, serves to facilitate compliance risk management and to oversee the implementation of Ally's compliance risk-management strategies and covers compliance matters across the enterprise including matters impacting customers, products, geographies, and services.\nConduct Risk\nConduct risk is the risk of customer harm, employee harm, reputational damage, regulatory sanction, or financial loss resulting from the behavior of our employees and contractors toward customers, counterparties, other employees and contractors, or the markets in which we operate.\nBusiness lines are responsible for driving a culture consistent with our LEAD\u201d core values and Do it Right\u201d philosophy (otherwise known as the Tone from the Top\u201d). Ally maintains an enterprise-wide Conduct Risk Management program that establishes the requirements, standards, and processes to manage conduct risk.\nWe manage conduct risk through a variety of enterprise programs, policies, and procedures. Associates complete required training at on-boarding, and annually thereafter, to affirm their compliance with our Code of Conduct and Ethics. Training programs and other resources set expectations surrounding appropriate conduct, and behavior, and a culture of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies, and standards. Officers and employees are expected to take personal responsibility for maintaining the highest standards of honesty, trustworthiness, and ethical behavior; to understand and manage the risks associated with their positions; and to escalate concerns about risk management (including reporting of potential violations of the Code of Conduct and Ethics, our policies, or other laws and regulations). Conduct risk is considered through various human resources and management activities including associate recruiting, on-boarding, performance management, incentive programs and compensation, and corrective action. Oversight of conduct risk is performed by Enterprise Risk Management.\nEmployee engagement surveys and risk culture surveys provide valuable insight into employee views and opinions about the company's culture and conduct. The Ethics Hotline (independently managed, available to associates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) and Open-Door Process provide avenues for employees to report concerns or incidents of potential misconduct. Human Resources, Employee Relations, and Enterprise Fraud, Security, and Investigations have established processes and procedures for investigating and addressing cases of potential fraud or employee misconduct.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nLiquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital\nOverview\nThe purpose of liquidity management is to enable us to meet loan and operating lease demand, debt maturities, deposit withdrawals, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions as well as periods of economic or financial stress. Our primary objective is to maintain cost-effective, stable and diverse sources of funding capable of sustaining the organization throughout all market cycles. Sources of funding include both retail and brokered deposits and secured and unsecured market-based funding across various maturity, interest rate, and investor profiles. Additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities, committed secured credit facilities, repurchase agreements, and advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh.\nWe define liquidity risk as the risk that an institution's financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions. Liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institution-specific or market-related events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization. Effective management of liquidity risk positions an organization to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events. Managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions.\nThe Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO), chaired by the Corporate Treasurer, is responsible for overseeing our funding and liquidity strategies. Corporate Treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within limits approved by ALCO and the RC. As part of managing liquidity risk, Corporate Treasury prepares periodic forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds, executes our funding strategies, and manages liquidity under normal as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments. Oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk are provided by Independent Risk Management.\nFunding Strategy\nLiquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and cost-effective access to retail deposits and funding in various segments of the capital markets. We focus on maintaining diversified funding sources across a broad base of depositors, lenders, and investors to meet liquidity needs throughout different economic cycles, including periods of financial distress. These funding sources include retail and brokered deposits, committed secured credit facilities, public and private asset-backed securitizations, unsecured debt, FHLB advances, whole-loan sales, demand notes, and repurchase agreements. Our access to diversified funding sources enhances funding flexibility and results in a more cost-effective funding strategy over the long term. We evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles.\nWe manage our funding to achieve a well-balanced portfolio across a spectrum of risk, maturity, and cost-of-funds characteristics. Optimizing funding at Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our long-term liquidity strategy. We optimize our funding sources at Ally Bank by growing retail deposits, maintaining active public and private securitization programs, managing a prudent maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio, utilizing repurchase agreements, and continuing to access funds from the FHLB.\nEssentially all asset originations are directed to Ally Bank to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements, and to utilize our growing consumer deposit-taking capabilities. This allows us to use bank funding for an increasing proportion of our automotive finance and other assets and to provide a sustainable long-term funding channel for the business, while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nMultiple metrics are used to measure liquidity risk, manage the liquidity position, identify related trends, and monitor such trends and metrics against established limits. These metrics include coverage ratios and comprehensive stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio over stressed horizons ranging from overnight to 12 months, stability ratios that measure longer-term structural liquidity, and concentration ratios that enable prudent funding diversification. In addition, we have established internal management routines designed to review all aspects of liquidity and funding plans, evaluate the adequacy of liquidity buffers, review stress testing results, and assist management in the execution of its funding strategy and risk-management accountabilities.\nDuring October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized revisions to its regulatory framework which tailor regulatory requirements based on a banking organization's asset size and other supplementary measures, as further discussed in the section titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item I, of this report. Those revisions exempt Ally from complying with the LCR and LCR Disclosure Requirements and Ally ceased publication of this disclosure effective December 31, 2019. We do not anticipate a material change to Ally's funding and liquidity position as a result of the changes to the LCR requirement.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nOur liquidity stress testing is designed to allow us to operate our businesses and to meet our contractual and contingent obligations, including unsecured debt maturities, for at least 12 months, assuming our normal access to funding is disrupted by severe market-wide and enterprise-specific events. We maintain available liquidity in the form of cash, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and available committed secured credit facility capacity. This available liquidity is held at various legal entities, taking into consideration regulatory restrictions and tax implications that may limit our ability to transfer funds across entities. The following table summarizes our total available liquidity.\n\n (a) Funding from committed secured credit facilities is available on request in the event excess collateral resides in certain facilities or the extent incremental collateral is available and contributed to the facilities.  Recent Funding Developments\nDuring 2019, we accessed the public and private markets to execute secured funding transactions, an unsecured funding transaction, and to manage our committed secured credit facility capacity. Key funding highlights from January 1, 2019, to date were as follows:\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we raised $3.6 billion through securitizations backed by consumer automotive loans. \n \u2022 In May 2019, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised $750 million through the issuance of senior notes. \n \u2022 Our total capacity in committed secured credit facilities was reduced by $6.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, as we continue to shift our overall funding toward a greater mix of cost-effective deposit funding.  Funding Sources\nThe following table summarizes our sources of funding and the amount outstanding under each category for the periods shown.\n\n (a) Includes $271 million and $347 million of retail term notes at December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. \n (b) Includes hedge basis adjustment as described in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the scheduled maturity of long-term debt at December 31, 2019.\nDeposits\nAlly Bank is a direct bank with no branch network that obtains retail deposits directly from customers through internet, telephone, mobile, and mail channels. These retail deposits provide our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, Corporate Finance operations and Ally Lending with a stable and low-cost funding source. Retail deposits are a key driver of funding cost optimization and reducing reliance on capital markets-based funding. We believe retail deposits are less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility, or changes in credit ratings when compared to other funding sources. We have continued to expand our deposit gathering efforts through both direct and indirect marketing channels. Current retail deposit offerings consist of a variety of products including CDs, savings accounts, money-market accounts, IRA deposit products, as well as an interest checking product. In addition, we utilize brokered deposits, which are obtained through third-party intermediaries, including a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table shows Ally Bank's number of accounts and deposit balances as of the end of each quarter since 2018.\n\n (a) Brokered deposit balances include a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances deposited at Ally Bank by a third party of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2019, $1.1 billion as September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, and $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2018, June 30, 2018, and March 31, 2018. \n (b) Other deposits include mortgage escrow and other deposits.  During 2019, our total deposit base grew $14.6 billion and we added approximately 322 thousand retail deposit customers, resulting in 1.97 million total retail deposit customers as of December 31, 2019. The recent growth in total deposits has been primarily attributable to our retail deposit portfolio-particularly within our online savings product and retail CDs. Strong retention rates and customer acquisition, reflecting the strength of the brand, continue to drive growth in retail deposits. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of deposit funding by type.\nSecuritizations and Secured Financings\nIn addition to building a larger deposit base, securitizations and secured funding continue to be a reliable and cost-effective source of financing. Securitizations and secured funding transactions, collectively referred to as securitization transactions due to their similarities, allow us to convert our automotive finance receivables and operating leases into cash earlier than what would have occurred in the normal course of business, and we continue to remain active in the well-established securitization markets.\nAs part of these securitization transactions, we sell assets to various special purpose entities (SPEs) in exchange for the proceeds from the issuance of debt and other beneficial interests in the assets. The activities of the SPEs are generally limited to acquiring the assets, issuing and making payments on the debt, paying related expenses, and periodically reporting to investors.\nThese SPEs are separate legal entities that assume the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables they hold. The assets of the SPEs are not available to satisfy our claims or those of our creditors. In addition, the SPEs do not invest in our equity or in the equity of any of our affiliates. Our economic exposure related to the SPEs is generally limited to cash reserves, retained interests, and customary representation, warranty, and covenant provisions.\nWe typically agree to service the assets transferred in our securitization transactions for a fee, and we may be entitled to other related fees. The total amount of servicing fees earned is disclosed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We may also retain a portion of senior and subordinated interests issued by the SPEs. Subordinate interests typically provide credit support to the more highly rated senior interest in a securitization transaction and may be subject to all or a portion of the first-loss position related to the sold assets.\nCertain of these securitization transactions meet the criteria to be accounted for as off-balance-sheet securitization transactions if we do not hold a potentially significant economic interest or do not provide servicing or asset management functions for the financial assets held by the securitization entity. Certain of our securitization transactions do not meet the required criteria to be accounted for as off-balance-sheet securitization transactions; therefore, they are accounted for as secured borrowings. For information regarding our securitization activities, refer to Note 1 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2019, we raised $3.6 billion through the completion of term securitization transactions backed by consumer automotive loans. Additionally, for consumer automotive loans and operating leases, the term structure of the transaction locks in funding for a specified pool of loans and operating leases, creating an effective tool for managing interest rate and liquidity risk.\nWe manage securitization execution risk by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and available capacity from committed secured credit facilities provided by banks. Our ability to access the unused capacity in these facilities depends on the availability of eligible assets to collateralize the incremental funding and, in some instances, on the execution of interest rate hedges. We maintain bilateral facilities, which fund our Automotive Finance operations. The facilities can be revolving in nature-generally having an original tenor ranging from 364 days to two years and allowing for additional funding during the commitment period-or they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the commitment period. At December 31, 2019, all of our $2.5 billion of capacity was revolving and of this balance, $1.1 billion was from facilities with a remaining tenor greater than 364 days.\nWe also have access to funding through advances with the FHLB. These advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and investment securities. As of December 31, 2019, we had pledged $24.8 billion of assets to the FHLB resulting in $18.8 billion in total funding capacity with $16.3 billion of debt outstanding.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAt December 31, 2019, $46.2 billion of our total assets were restricted as collateral for the payment of debt obligations accounted for as secured borrowings and repurchase agreements. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nUnsecured Financings\nWe obtain unsecured funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes under our Demand Notes program. The holder has the option to require us to redeem these notes at any time without restriction. Demand Notes outstanding were $2.6 billion at December 31, 2019. We also have short-term and long-term unsecured debt outstanding from retail term note programs. These programs are composed of callable fixed-rate instruments with fixed-maturity dates and floating-rate notes. There were $271 million of retail term notes outstanding at December 31, 2019. The remainder of our unsecured debt is composed of institutional term debt. In May 2019, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised $750 million through the issuance of senior notes. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term unsecured debt.\nOther Secured and Unsecured Short-term Borrowings\nWe have access to repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. The securities sold in repurchase agreements include U.S. government and federal agency obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we had no debt outstanding under repurchase agreements.\nAdditionally, we have access to the FRB Discount Window and can borrow funds to meet short-term liquidity demands. However, the FRB is not a primary source of funding for day-to-day business. Instead, it is a liquidity source that can be accessed in stressed environments or periods of market disruption. We had assets pledged and restricted as collateral to the FRB totaling $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. We had no debt outstanding with the FRB as of December 31, 2019.\nCash Flows\nThe following summarizes the activity reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While this information may be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may not be as helpful when analyzing changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity, dividends, and ALM herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and related activity.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Activity was largely consistent year-over-year, as cash flows from our consumer and commercial lending activities remained relatively flat.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $14.5 billion for the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $9.7 billion net decrease in cash outflows from purchases, sales, originations and repayments of finance receivables and loans, as repayments outpaced originations. This decrease was also driven by a $835 million increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities, net proceeds from sales and repayments. This was partially offset by a $778 million increase in net outflows from purchases of operating lease assets, net of disposals.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $1.5 billion, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $10.7 billion for the same period in 2018. The change was primarily attributable to a $11.5 billion decrease in net cash inflows due to issuance of long-term debt and an increase in net cash outflows related to short-term borrowings of $3.0 billion between the two periods. This was partially offset by an increase of $1.7 billion from net cash inflows associated with deposits.\nCapital Planning and Stress Tests\nUnder the final rules implementing the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act), as further described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are (1) made subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle rather than the previously required one-year cycle, (2) required to continue submitting an annual capital plan to the FRB, (3) allowed to continue excluding accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital, (4) exempted from company-run capital stress testing, and (5) allowed to remain exempted from the supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer.\nOur annual capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on our capital. The plan must also include a discussion of how we, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with its risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, and will serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to the plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection. If the FRB objects to the plan, or if certain material events occur after submission of the plan, we must submit a revised plan to the FRB within 30 days. Even if the FRB does not object to the plan, we may be precluded from or limited in paying dividends or other capital distributions without the FRB's approval under certain circumstances-for example, when we would not meet minimum regulatory capital ratios and capital buffers after giving effect to the distributions.\nIn October 2019, the FRB noted its intent to propose changes to the capital-plan rule, including for the purpose of providing Category IV firms like us with additional flexibility in developing their annual capital plans. At this time, the impacts that such a potential future proposal may have on us are not clear.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents information related to our common stock and distributions to our common stockholders over the last eight quarters.\n\n (a) Includes shares of common stock withheld to cover income taxes owed by participants in our share-based incentive plans. \n (b) On January 13, 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share on all common stock, payable on February 14, 2020. Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this common stock dividend.  We received a non-objection to our 2018 capital plan in June 2018. We were not required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB, participate in the supervisory stress test or CCAR, or conduct company-run capital stress tests during the 2019 cycle. Instead, our capital actions during this cycle are largely based on the results from our 2018 supervisory stress test. On April 1, 2019, our Board authorized an increase in our stock-repurchase program, permitting us to repurchase up to $1.25 billion of our common stock from time to time from the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020, representing a 25% increase over our previously announced program. Additionally, on January 13, 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our common stock. Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the most recent dividend.\nOur ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, will continue to be subject to the FRB's review and internal governance requirements, including approval by our Board. The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases also will be subject to various factors, including Ally's capital and liquidity positions, regulatory considerations, any accounting standards that affect capital or liquidity (including CECL), financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, common-stock price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time.\nRegulatory Capital\nRefer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section titled Selected Financial Data within this MD&A.\nCredit Ratings\nThe cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by credit ratings, which are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation. Lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. This is particularly true for certain institutional investors whose investment guidelines require investment-grade ratings on term debt and the two highest rating categories for short-term debt (particularly money-market investors).\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nNationally recognized statistical rating organizations rate substantially all our debt. The following table summarizes our current ratings and outlook by the respective nationally recognized rating agencies.\n\n (a) Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- from BB+, upgraded our short-term rating to from B, and changed the outlook to Stable from Positive on August 19, 2019. \n (b) Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to Ba1 from Ba2, affirmed our short-term rating of Not Prime, and maintained a Stable outlook on December 19, 2019. Effective December 1, 2014, we determined to not renew our contractual arrangement with Moody's related to their providing of our issuer, senior unsecured debt, and short-term ratings. Notwithstanding this, Moody's has determined to continue to provide these ratings on a discretionary basis. However, Moody's has no obligation to continue to provide these ratings, and could cease doing so at any time. \n (c) Standard & Poor's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- from BB+, upgraded our short-term rating to A-3 from B, and changed the outlook to Stable from Positive on October 16, 2019. \n (d) DBRS affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of BBB (Low), affirmed our short-term rating of R-3, and changed the outlook to Positive from Stable on May 20, 2019.  During 2019, both S&P and Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BB+ to BBB-, which is defined by both rating agencies as an investment grade credit rating. Following our announcement to acquire CardWorks on February 18, 2020, Fitch, Moody's, S&P, and DBRS affirmed our credit ratings for our short-term and senior unsecured debt, with each agency maintaining its respective outlook.\nRating agencies indicate that they base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, which may include capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current operating, legislative, and regulatory environment. Rating agencies themselves could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices-particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes. Potential changes in rating methodology, as well as in the legislative and regulatory environment, and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nA credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nInsurance Financial Strength Ratings\nSubstantially all of our Insurance operations have a Financial Strength Rating (FSR) and an Issuer Credit Rating (ICR) from the A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best). The FSR is intended to be an indicator of the ability of the insurance company to meet its senior most obligations to policyholders. Lower ratings generally result in fewer opportunities to write business, as insureds, particularly large commercial insureds, and insurance companies purchasing reinsurance have guidelines requiring high FSR ratings. On August 30, 2019, A.M. Best upgraded the FSR for Ally Insurance Group to A- (excellent) from B++ (good), and upgraded the ICR to a- from bbb+. The outlook was revised to Stable from Positive.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nRefer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGuarantees\nGuarantees are defined as contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to third parties based on changes in an underlying agreement that is related to a guaranteed party. Our guarantees include client securities to a clearing broker, standby letters of credit, and certain contract provisions associated with securitizations, sales, and divestitures. Refer to Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our outstanding guarantees to third parties.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nThe following table provides aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations disclosed elsewhere in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n (a) Total long-term debt amount reflects the remaining principal obligation and excludes net original issue discount of $1.1 billion, unamortized debt issuance costs of $86 million, and a favorable hedge basis adjustment of $24 million related to fixed-rate debt previously designated as a hedged item. \n (b) Estimated using a forecasted variable interest model, when available, or the applicable variable interest rate as of the most recent reset date prior to December 31, 2019. For additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (c) Excludes a forward-starting lease agreement for a new corporate facility in Charlotte, North Carolina, scheduled to commence in April 2021. The lease agreement will have a total of $290 million in undiscounted future lease payments over the 15-year term of the lease. \n (d) Amounts presented exclude unamortized commissions paid to brokers. \n (e) Deposits exclude estimated interest payments. \n (f) Deposits without a stated maturity are payable on demand and include savings and money market checking, mortgage escrow, dealer, and other deposits; and are classified above as due in less than one year.  The foregoing table does not include our reserves for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, which total $122 million at December 31, 2019. While payments due on insurance losses are considered contractual obligations because they related to insurance policies issued by us, the ultimate amount to be paid and the timing of payment for an insurance loss is an estimate subject to significant uncertainty. Furthermore, the majority of the balance is expected to be paid out in less than five years.\nThe following provides a description of the items summarized in the preceding table of contractual obligations.\nLong-term Debt\nAmounts represent the scheduled maturity of long-term debt at December 31, 2019, assuming that no early redemptions occur. The maturity of secured debt may vary based on the payment activity of the related secured assets. The amounts presented are before the effect of any unamortized discount, debt issuance costs, or fair value adjustment. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt obligations. We primarily use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our secured and unsecured long-term debt portfolio. These derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. For additional information on derivatives, refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLease Commitments\nWe have obligations under various operating lease arrangements for real property with noncancelable lease terms that expire after December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nPurchase Obligations\nWe enter into multiple contractual arrangements for various services. The arrangements represent fixed payment obligations under our most significant contracts and primarily relate to contracts with information technology providers. Refer to Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nBank Certificates of Deposit\nRefer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAlly Financial Inc. \u2022 Form 10-K\nLending Commitments\nWe have outstanding lending commitments with customers. The amounts presented represent the unused portion of those commitments at December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nAccounting policies are integral to understanding our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions, on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; critical accounting estimates are described in this section. An accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to these estimates.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses (the allowance) to absorb probable loan credit losses inherent in the held-for-investment portfolio. The allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience in our lending portfolio. The allowance is management's estimate of incurred losses in our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment. Management performs quarterly analyses of these portfolios to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses. Additions to the allowance are charged to current period earnings through the provision for loan losses; amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance, while amounts recovered on previously charged-off accounts increase the allowance. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance requires management to exercise significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, including the timing, frequency, and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for loan losses and, therefore, net income. For additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes, refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While we attribute portions of the allowance across our lending portfolios, the entire allowance is available to absorb probable loan losses inherent in our total lending portfolio.\nThe consumer portfolio segments consist of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans within our Automotive Finance operations, Mortgage Finance operations, and consumer unsecured lending included within Corporate and Other. Excluding certain loans that are identified as individually impaired, the allowance for each consumer portfolio segment (automotive, mortgage, and other) is evaluated collectively. The allowance is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations that begin with estimates of incurred losses in each portfolio segment based on various statistical analyses for our automotive and mortgage portfolio segments, and a vintage analysis for our other portfolio segment. We leverage statistical models based on recent loss trends to develop a systematic incurred loss reserve. These statistical loss forecasting models are utilized to estimate incurred losses and consider several credit quality indicators including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, current economic conditions, credit scores, and expected loss factors by loan type. Management believes these factors are relevant to estimate incurred losses and are updated on a quarterly basis in order to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment, as changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact. In order to develop our best estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio, management reviews and analyzes the output from the models and may adjust the reserves to take into consideration environmental, qualitative, and other factors that may not be captured in the models. These adjustments are documented and reviewed through our risk management processes. Management reviews, updates, and validates its systematic process and loss assumpt
