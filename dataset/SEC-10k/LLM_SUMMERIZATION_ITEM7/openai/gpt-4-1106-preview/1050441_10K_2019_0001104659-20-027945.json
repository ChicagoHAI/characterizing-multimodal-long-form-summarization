The Company provides general commercial and consumer banking services through the Bank, its wholly owned banking subsidiary, a Maryland chartered bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Company was organized in October 1997, to be the holding company for the Bank. The Bank was organized in 1998 as an independent, community oriented, full service banking alternative to the super regional financial institutions, which dominate the Company's primary market area. The Company's philosophy is to provide superior, personalized service to its customers. The Company focuses on relationship banking, providing each customer with a number of services and becoming familiar with and addressing customer needs in a proactive, personalized fashion. The Bank currently has a total of twenty branch offices, including nine in Northern Virginia, six in Suburban Maryland, and five in Washington, D.C.\nThe Bank offers a broad range of commercial banking services to its business and professional clients as well as full service consumer banking services to individuals living and/or working primarily in the Bank's market area. The Bank emphasizes providing commercial banking services to sole proprietors, small and medium-sized businesses, non-profit organizations and associations, and investors living and working in and near the primary service area. These services include the usual deposit functions of commercial banks, including business and personal checking accounts, \"NOW\" accounts and money market and savings accounts, business, construction, and commercial loans, residential mortgages and consumer loans, and cash management services. The Bank is also active in the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans and the origination of SBA loans. The residential mortgage loans are originated for sale to third-party investors, generally large mortgage and banking companies, under best efforts and mandatory delivery commitments with the investors to purchase the loans subject to compliance with pre-established criteria. The Bank generally sells the guaranteed portion of the SBA loans in a transaction apart from the loan origination generating noninterest income from the gains on sale, as well as servicing income on the portion participated. The Company originates multifamily FHA loans through HUD's MAP. The Company securitizes these loans through the Ginnie Mae MBS I program, and sells the resulting securities in the open market to authorized dealers in the normal course of business and periodically bundles and sells the servicing rights. Bethesda Leasing, LLC, a subsidiary of the Bank, holds title to and manages other real estate owned (\"OREO\") assets. Eagle Insurance Services, LLC, a subsidiary of the Bank, offers access to insurance products and services through a referral program with a third party insurance broker. Additionally, the Bank offers investment advisory services through referral programs with third parties. Landroval Municipal Finance, Inc., a subsidiary of the Bank, focuses on lending to municipalities by buying debt on the public market as well as direct purchase issuance.\nAs 2019 began, expectations were high that the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, or FOMC, would continue moving short-term interest rates higher after they adjusted the Federal Funds Target rate up by 25 bps four times over the course of 2018. They also continued their plans for reducing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as U.S. Treasuries and mortgage backed securities mature and that cash flow was not reinvested. Actual GDP growth for 2019 in the U.S. was expected to be slightly below 2018 and after considerable negative market sentiment occurred, the FOMC reversed course and lowered short term rates three times in 2019. It also began increasing its balance sheet to support liquidity in the Federal Funds market. The 2019 U.S. official unemployment rate declined to 3.53% by year end. 2019 saw steady job growth, above average wage growth, an increase in the labor force participation rate, and improved consumer confidence levels. These fundamentals were factored into the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy, but the slowing growth and the lack of inflation led to the three 25 basis point rate cuts in the year. The Federal Reserve Board is currently indicating that this level of monetary policy is appropriate and any changes from here will be data dependent.\nLonger-term U.S. interest rates were much lower in 2019 than expected, with the ten year U.S. Treasury rate averaging 2.15% in 2019 as compared to 2.96% in 2018. The yield curve continued to flatten (two year as compared to ten year U.S. Treasury rates) during 2019 as the long end of the yield curve fell more sharply than the short end. The relative volatility of long-term interest rates was partly a function of attractive yields in U.S. Treasury securities relative to non U.S. bonds, as there remained some perceived weaknesses in European Central Bank economies generally, along with geopolitical risks, and expectations of slowing global growth. Energy prices (oil and natural gas), after a period of low prices in 2016, and a steady climb over the course of 2017 and early 2018 came back down\nbelow 2017 prices by the end of 2018. In 2019, energy prices remained relatively stable at 2018's average price. Inflationary factors remained close to, but still below, the FOMC's target rate of 2.00% throughout 2019.\nAs the ten year U.S. Treasury rate dropped back to 2016 levels in the summer of 2019, the volume of residential mortgage lending began to increase. Overall, real estate values in most of the Company's markets were stable to increasing in 2019 as interest rates remained historically low and job growth and personal income levels rose modestly. Political gridlock continued in Washington, D.C. over concerns of Presidential impeachment, immigration and health care policy, public debt and deficits, as well as tax policy and spending levels. Major corporate and personal tax reform was passed late in 2017, which benefited business earnings and consumer spending, while deficit spending continued and remains a point of serious concern.\nThe Company's primary market, the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, has continued to perform well relative to other parts of the country, due to good growth in the private sector along with increased government spending, and this was no different in 2019. Private sector growth was attributable in part to a diverse economy including a large healthcare component, substantial business services, and a highly educated work force.\nDuring 2019, the Company enhanced its marketplace positioning by remaining proactive in growing client relationships. The Company has had the financial resources to meet, and has remained committed to meeting, the credit needs of its community, resulting in continued growth in the Bank's loan portfolio during 2019. Furthermore, the Company's capital position remained strong in 2019 as a result of very strong and consistent earnings despite higher legal expenses. As a result of the Company's strong capital position and earnings, it was able to initiate a quarterly dividend and to implement a share repurchase program. The Company believes its strategy of remaining growth-oriented, retaining talented staff and maintaining focus on seeking quality lending and deposit relationships has proven successful and is evidenced in its financial and performance ratios. Additionally, the Company believes such focus and strategy of relationship building has fostered future growth opportunities, as the Company's reputation in the marketplace has continued to grow. At December 31, 2019, the Company had total assets of approximately $8.99 billion, total loans of $7.55 billion, total deposits of $7.22 billion and twenty branches in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.\nOperating in the more competitive economic environment of 2019, the Bank was able to produce solid growth in loans. Additionally, the Bank was able to grow its net interest spread earnings, maintain an above average net interest margin in spite of margin compression, retain a strong position regarding asset quality, and generate continued favorable enhanced operating leverage due to its seasoned and professional staff.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies, including for the year ended December 31, 2019 those identified below, inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or a valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility.\nInvestment Securities\nThe fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for investment securities available-for-sale are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available. The Company's investment portfolio is categorized as available-for-sale with unrealized gains and losses net of income tax being a component of shareholders' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two principles of accounting: (a) ASC Topic 450, Contingencies,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and are estimable and (b) ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan. The loss, if any, can be determined by the difference between the loan balance and the value of collateral, the present value of expected future cash flows, or values observable in the secondary markets.\nThree components comprise our allowance for credit losses: a specific allowance, a formula allowance and a nonspecific or environmental factors allowance. Each component is determined based on estimates that can and do change when actual events occur.\nThe specific allowance allocates a reserve to identified impaired loans. Impaired loans are assigned specific reserves based on an impairment analysis. Under ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d a loan for which reserves are individually allocated may show deficiencies in the borrower's overall financial condition, payment record, support available from financial guarantors and for the fair market value of collateral. When a loan is identified as impaired, a specific reserve is established based on the Company's assessment of the loss that may be associated with the individual loan.\nThe formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on internally risk rated loans, exclusive of those identified as requiring specific reserves. The portfolio of unimpaired loans is stratified by loan type and risk assessment. Allowance factors relate to the type of loan and level of the internal risk rating, with loans exhibiting higher risk and loss experience receiving a higher allowance factor.\nThe environmental factors allowance is also used to estimate the loss associated with pools of non-classified loans. These non-classified loans are also stratified by loan type, and environmental allowance factors are assigned by management based upon a number of conditions, including delinquencies, loss history, changes in lending policy and procedures, changes in business and economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, management expertise, concentrations within the portfolio, quality of internal and external loan review systems, competition, and legal and regulatory requirements.\nThe allowance captures losses inherent in the loan portfolio, which have not yet been recognized. Allowance factors and the overall size of the allowance may change from period to period based upon management's assessment of the above described factors, the relative weights given to each factor, and portfolio composition.\nManagement has significant discretion in making the judgments inherent in the determination of the provision and allowance for credit losses, including in connection with the valuation of collateral, a borrower's prospects of repayment, and in establishing allowance factors on the formula and environmental components of the allowance. The establishment of allowance factors involves a continuing evaluation, based on management's ongoing assessment of the global factors discussed above and their impact on the portfolio. The allowance factors may change from period to period, resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount of the provision or allowance, based upon the same volume and classification of loans. Changes in allowance factors can have a direct impact on the amount of the provision, and a related after tax effect on net income. Errors in management's perception and assessment of the global factors and their impact on the portfolio could result in the allowance not being adequate to cover losses in the portfolio, and may result in additional provisions or charge-offs. Alternatively, errors in management's perception and assessment of the global factors and their impact on the portfolio could result in the allowance being in excess of amounts necessary to cover losses in the portfolio, and may result in lower provisions in the future. For additional information regarding the provision for credit losses, refer to the discussion under the caption Provision for Credit Losses\u201d below.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets and MSRs that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights. Intangible assets that have finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and subject to periodic impairment testing. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are amortized to expense using accelerated or straight-line methods over their respective estimated useful lives.\nGoodwill is subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level, which must be conducted at least annually. The Company performs impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired.\nThe Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the goodwill impairment test is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates reflecting the market rate of return, projected growth rates and determination and evaluation of appropriate market comparables. Based on the results of qualitative assessments of all reporting units, the Company concluded that no impairment existed at December 31, 2019. However, future events could cause the Company to conclude that goodwill or other intangibles have become impaired, which would result in recording an impairment loss. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes by recording deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws. If actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. The Company's accounting policy follows the prescribed authoritative guidance that a minimal probability threshold of a tax position must be met before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognized, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management's analysis of tax regulations and interpretations. Significant judgment may be involved in applying the applicable reporting and accounting requirements.\nManagement expects that the Company's adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates due to the requirement that any change in judgment or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which it occurs. Factors that could impact management's judgment include changes in income, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation,\u201d which requires the expense recognition for the fair value of share based compensation awards, such as stock options, restricted stock awards, and performance based shares. This standard allows management to establish modeling assumptions as to expected stock price volatility, option terms, forfeiture rates and dividend rates which directly impact estimated fair value. The accounting standard also allows for the use of alternative option pricing models which may impact fair value as determined. The Company's practice is to utilize reasonable and supportable assumptions.\nDerivatives\nFASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815\u201d), provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain the Company's objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company's net income was $142.9 million, a 6% decrease as compared to $152.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWhere appropriate, parenthetical references refer to operating earnings, which the Company believes are more relevant comparisons to current and historical period results of operations. Reconciliations of 2017 GAAP earnings to operating earnings are contained in the tables under Selected Financial Data\u201d.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net income was $4.18 per basic and diluted common share as compared to $4.44 per basic common share and $4.42 per diluted common share for 2018, a 6% decrease in basic and 5% decrease in diluted earnings per share for the full year of 2019 as compared to 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reported a return on average assets, or ROAA, of 1.61% as compared to 1.91% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The return on average common equity, or ROACE, for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 12.20%, as compared to 14.89% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The return on average tangible common equity, or ROATCE, for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 13.40%, as compared to 16.63% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's earnings are largely dependent on net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, which represented 92% and 93% of total revenue (defined as net interest income plus noninterest income) for the full year of 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe net interest margin, which measures the difference between interest income and interest expense (i.e., net interest income) as a percentage of average earning assets, decreased 33 basis points from 4.10% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 3.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average earning asset yields decreased by 9 basis points (5.09% to 5.00%) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by 34 basis points (to 1.95% from 1.61%). For 2019, in spite of competitive factors, the Company has been able to maintain its loan portfolio yields relatively close to 2018 levels (5.45% as compared to 5.54%) due to disciplined loan pricing practices.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the net interest spread decreased by 43 basis points (to 3.05% from 3.48%) as compared to 2018, due primarily to an increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased in 2019 largely as a result of interest rate increases by the FOMC in mid to late 2018 and increased competition for deposits within our market area, though funding costs started to moderate in the second half of 2019, as the market rate cuts passed through to the liability base. Overall, the Company believes its deposit mix and cost of funds remain favorable. The benefit of noninterest sources funding earning assets increased by 10 basis points to 72 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 62 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of a favorable mix of noninterest bearing deposits. The percentage of average noninterest deposits relative to average total deposits was 31% for the full year 2019 compared to 33% for the same period in 2018.\nThe combination of a 43 basis point decrease in the net interest spread and a 10 basis point increase in the value of noninterest sources resulted in the 33 basis point decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.\nThe Company believes it has effectively managed its net interest margin and net interest income during 2019 as market interest rates (on average) have remained quite low. This factor has been significant to overall earnings performance during the past year as net interest income represented 92% of the Company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe provision for credit losses was $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net charge-offs of $9.4 million during 2019 represented 0.13% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.5 million or 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, the allowance for credit losses represented 0.98% of loans outstanding, as compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. The allowance for credit losses represented 151% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to 430% at December 31, 2018.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $25.7 million from $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 14% increase.\nThe efficiency ratio, which measures the ratio of noninterest expense to total revenue, remained favorable at 39.99% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 37.31% for the same period in 2018. Total noninterest expenses totaled $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 10% increase. As a percentage of average assets, total noninterest expense was 1.58% for the year of 2019 as compared to 1.59% for the same period in 2018.\nThe ratio of common equity to total assets increased from 13.22% at December 31, 2018 to 13.25% at December 31, 2019 due to growth from retained earnings. As discussed under Capital Resources and Adequacy\u201d, the regulatory capital ratios of the Bank and Company remain above well capitalized levels.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets. Earning assets are composed primarily of loans, loans held for sale, investment securities, and interest bearing deposits with banks. The cost of funds represents interest expense on deposits, customer repurchase agreements and other borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB and subordinated notes. Noninterest bearing deposits and capital are other components representing funding sources. Changes in the volume and mix of assets and funding sources, along with the changes in yields earned and rates paid, determine changes in net interest income.\nNet interest income in 2019 was $324.0 million compared to $317.0 million in 2018 and $283.9 million in 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net interest income increased 2% over the same period for 2018. Average loans increased $694.8 million (10%) and average deposits increased by $787.1 million (12%). The net interest margin was 3.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 4.10% for the same period in 2018. The Company has been able to maintain its loan yields in 2019 relatively close to 2018 levels due to disciplined loan pricing practices, and has managed its funding costs while maintaining a favorable deposit mix; much of which has occurred from sales efforts to increase and deepen client relationships. In spite of margin compression, the Company believes its net interest margin remains favorable as compared to its peer banking companies.\nThe table below presents the average balances and rates of the major categories of the Company's assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Included in the table is a measurement of interest rate spread and margin. Interest rate spread is the difference (expressed as a percentage) between the interest rate earned on earning assets less the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities. While the interest rate spread provides a quick comparison of earnings rates as compared to cost of funds, management believes that the net interest margin provides a better measurement of performance. The net interest margin (as compared to the net interest spread) includes the effect of noninterest bearing sources in its calculation and is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nEagle Bancorp, Inc.\nConsolidated Average Balances, Interest Yields And Rates (Unaudited)\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 67: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses represents the amount of expense charged to current earnings to fund the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is based on many factors which reflect management's assessment of the risk in the loan portfolio. Those factors include historical losses, economic conditions and trends, the value and adequacy of collateral, volume and mix of the portfolio, performance of the portfolio, and internal loan processes of the Company and Bank.\nManagement has developed a comprehensive analytical process to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The process and guidelines were developed utilizing, among other factors, the guidance from federal banking regulatory agencies. The results of this process, in combination with conclusions of the Bank's outside loan review consultant, support management's assessment as to the adequacy of the allowance at the balance sheet date. Please refer to the discussion under the caption Critical Accounting Policies\u201d for an overview of the methodology management employs on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance and the provisions charged to expense. Also, refer to the table in the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section that reflects activity in the allowance for credit losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased $3.7 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018, reflecting $13.1 million in provision for credit losses and $9.4 million in net charge-offs during 2019. The provision for credit losses in 2019 compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The higher provisioning during 2019, as compared to 2018, is due to higher net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of $9.4 million during 2019 represented 0.13% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.5 million or 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2018. Net charge-offs during 2019 were attributable primarily to commercial real estate ($5.0 million) and commercial loans ($4.5 million).\nAt December 31, 2019 the allowance for credit losses represented 0.98% of loans outstanding, as compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. The allowance for credit losses represented 151% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to 430% at December 31, 2018.\nAs part of its comprehensive loan review process, the Bank's Board of Directors and Loan Committee or Credit Review Committee carefully evaluate loans which are past-due 30 days or more. The Committees make a thorough assessment of the conditions\nand circumstances surrounding each delinquent loan. The Bank's loan policy requires that loans be placed on nonaccrual if they are ninety days past-due, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, Credit Administration specifically analyzes the status of development and construction projects, sales activities and utilization of interest reserves in order to carefully and prudently assess potential increased levels of risk requiring additional reserves.\nThe maintenance of a high quality loan portfolio, with an adequate allowance for possible credit losses, will continue to be a primary management objective for the Company.\nNoninterest Income\nTotal noninterest income includes service charges on deposits, gain on sale of loans, gain on sale of investment securities, income from bank owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) and other income.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $25.7 million as compared to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 14% increase due to $2.7 million higher gains on sale of residential mortgage loans, $1.4 million higher gain on sale of investment securities, partially offset by $767 thousand lower service charges on deposits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, service charges on deposit accounts decreased $767 thousand to $6.2 million from $7.0 million for the same period in 2018, a decrease of 11%, due primarily to a lower volume of insufficient funds charges.\nGain on sale of loans consists of gains on the sale of SBA and residential mortgage loans. For the year ended December 31, 2019, gain on sale of loans increased from $6.0 million to $8.5 million, an increase of 42%, compared to the same period in 2018.\nThe Company originates residential mortgage loans and utilizes both mandatory delivery\u201d and best efforts\u201d forward loan sale commitments to sell those loans, servicing released. Sales of residential mortgage loans yielded gains of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $5.4 million in the same period in 2018, due to higher origination volume ($665.7 million for 2019 as compared to $415.8 million for 2018) and higher sales volume ($628.2 million for 2019 as compared to $421.6 million in 2018). Loans sold are subject to repurchase in circumstances where documentation is deficient or the underlying loan becomes delinquent or pays off within a specified period following loan funding and sale. The Bank considers these potential recourse provisions to be a minimal risk, but has established a reserve under generally accepted accounting principles for possible repurchases. There were no repurchases due to fraud by the borrower during the year ended December 31, 2019. The reserve amounted to $79 thousand at December 31, 2019 and is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bank does not originate sub-prime\u201d loans and has no exposure to this market segment.\nThe Company is an originator of SBA loans and its practice is to sell the guaranteed portion of those loans at a premium. Income from this source was $309 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $540 thousand for the same period in 2018. Activity in SBA loan sales to secondary markets can vary widely from year to year.\nOther income totaled $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $8.0 million for the same period in 2018, a decrease of 3%.\nNet investment gains amounted to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $97 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe FHA business unit generated income of $501 thousand on the origination, securitization, servicing and sale of FHA Multifamily-Backed GNMA securities for the full year 2019 compared to $357 thousand for the same period in 2018.\nServicing agreements relating to the Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities program require the Company to advance funds to make scheduled payments of principal, interest, taxes and insurance, if such payments have not been received from the borrowers. The Company will generally recover funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements under the FHA insurance and guarantee program. However, in the interim, the Company must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding. The Company must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans. In addition, if a defaulted loan is not cured, the mortgage loan would be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and the Company would not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no funds advanced outstanding under FHA mortgage loan servicing agreements. To the extent the mortgage loans underlying the Company's servicing portfolio experience delinquencies, the Company would be required to dedicate cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts.\nNoninterest Expense\nTotal noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, premises and equipment expenses, marketing and advertising, data processing, legal, accounting and professional fees, FDIC insurance premiums, and other expenses.\nTotal noninterest expenses totaled $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 10% increase. For 2019, the efficiency ratio was 39.99% as compared to 37.31% for the same period in 2018.\nSalaries and employee benefits were $79.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $67.7 million for the same period in 2018, an increase of 18%. Cost increases for salaries and benefits were due primarily to $8.2 million of nonrecurring charges related to acceleration of share based compensation expenses associated with the retirement of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the resignation of certain directors. In addition, $4.0 million of the increase resulted from additional staffing, merit increases, and incentives. At December 31, 2019, the Company's full time equivalent staff numbered 492, as compared to 470 at December 31, 2018.\nPremises and equipment expenses amounted to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $15.7 million for the same period in 2018, a decrease of 8%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $527 thousand of sublease revenue as compared to $501 thousand for the same period in 2018. The sublease revenue is accounted for as a reduction to premises and equipment expenses.\nMarketing and advertising expenses increased to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $4.6 million for the same period in 2018, an increase of 6%, due primarily to increased digital and print advertising spend.\nData processing expenses decreased from $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $9.4 million for 2019, a decrease of 3%, primarily due to ongoing contract renegotiations.\nLegal, accounting and professional fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $12.2 million from $9.7 million in 2018, a 25% increase. The increased expenses were primarily associated with legal fees and expenditures associated with ongoing governmental investigations and related subpoenas and document requests. The Company expects to continue to incur elevated levels of legal and professional fees and expenses in 2020 as it continues to cooperate with these investigations.\nFDIC insurance decreased $306 thousand to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 9% compared to 2018, due to one time premium credits in the second and third quarters of 2019 due to the deposit insurance fund exceeding regulatory levels partially offset by premiums on a larger deposit base.\nOther expenses increased to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $15.8 million for the same period in 2018, an increase of 1%. The major components of cost in this category include broker fees, franchise tax, core deposit intangible amortization, insurance expenses, and director compensation. Cost control remains a significant operating objective of the Company.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $53.8 million in 2019 compared to $51.9 million in 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 27.4% and 25.4%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for 2019 was due primarily to a decrease in federal tax credits, an increase in nondeductible expenses, and adjustments related to the completion of the 2018 tax returns.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nOverview\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 were $8.99 billion, a 7% increase as compared to $8.39 billion at December 31, 2018. Total loans (excluding loans held for sale) were $7.55 billion at December 31, 2019, an 8% increase as compared to $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018. Loans held for sale amounted to $56.7 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018, a 195% increase. The investment portfolio totaled $843.4 million at December 31, 2019, an 8% increase from $784.1 million at December 31, 2018.\nTotal borrowed funds (excluding customer repurchase agreements) were $467.7 million at December 31, 2019 and $217.3 million at December 31, 2018, a 115% increase due to the $250.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nTotal shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 increased 7%, to $1.19 billion from $1.11 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity from December 31, 2018 was primarily due to increased retained earnings. Growth in retained earnings has enhanced the Company's capital position well in excess of regulatory requirements for well capitalized status.\nThe total risk based capital ratio was 16.20% at December 31, 2019, as compared to 16.08% at December 31, 2018. In addition, the tangible common equity ratio was 12.22% at December 31, 2019, compared to 12.11% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of common equity to total assets was 13.25% at December 31, 2019 as compared to 13.22% at December 31, 2018.\nInvestment Securities Available-for-Sale and Short-Term Investments\nThe tables below and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information regarding the Company's investment securities categorized as available-for-sale\u201d, or AFS. The Company classifies all its investment securities as AFS. This classification requires that investment securities be recorded at their fair value with any difference between the fair value and amortized cost (the purchase price adjusted by any discount accretion or premium amortization) reported as a component of shareholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income), net of deferred income taxes. At December 31, 2019, the Company had a net unrealized gain in AFS securities of $4.2 million with a deferred tax liability of $757 thousand, as compared to a net unrealized loss in AFS securities of $9.5 million at December 31, 2018, with a deferred tax asset of $2.8 million.\nThe AFS portfolio is comprised of U.S. agency securities (13% of AFS securities) with an average duration of 2.9 years, seasoned mortgage backed securities that are 100% agency issued (72% of AFS securities) which have an average expected life of 5.5 years with contractual maturities of the underlying mortgages of up to thirty years, municipal bonds (8% of AFS securities) which have an average duration of 4.0 years, U.S. Treasuries (4% of AFS securities) which have an average duration of 0.3 years, corporate bonds (1% of AFS securities) which have an average duration of 5 years, and equity investments which comprise less than 1% of AFS securities. The equity investment consists of common stock of two community banking companies with an estimated fair value of $198 thousand. Ninety eight percent of the investment securities which are debt instruments are rated AAA or AA or have the implicit guarantee of the U.S. Treasury.\nAt December 31, 2019, the investment portfolio amounted to $843.4 million as compared to $784.1 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of 8%. The investment portfolio is managed to achieve goals related to liquidity, income, interest rate risk management and to provide collateral for customer repurchase agreements and other borrowing relationships.\nThe following table provides information regarding the composition of the Company's investment securities portfolio at the dates indicated. Amounts are reported at estimated fair value. The change in composition of the portfolio at December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was due principally to ALCO decisions to buy longer-term municipal investments and increase holdings of U.S. agency securities to better position the Company for the current interest rate environment while maintaining portfolio cash flow and liquidity. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the investment portfolio balances increased as compared to balances at December 31, 2018, as the Bank's deposit growth outpaced loan growth.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.

Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

These funds represent excess daily liquidity which is invested on an unsecured basis with well capitalized banks, in amounts generally limited both in the aggregate and to any one bank.\nInterest bearing deposits with banks and other short-term investments amounted to $195.4 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $303.2 million at December 31, 2018. These short term investments represent liquid funds held at the Federal Reserve to meet future loan demand, to fund future increases in investment securities and to meet other general liquidity needs of the Company. The Bank also holds a time deposit amounting to $1.6 million at December 31, 2019 and $1.6 million at December 31, 2018.\nLoan Portfolio\nIn its lending activities, the Company seeks to develop and expand relationships with clients whose businesses and individual banking needs will grow with the Bank. Superior customer service, local decision making, and accelerated turnaround time from application to closing have been significant factors in growing the loan portfolio, and meeting the lending needs in the markets served, while maintaining sound asset quality.\nLoan growth over the past year has been favorable, with loans outstanding reaching $7.55 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $554 million or 8% as compared to $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018. Loan growth over the last twelve months was due in part to the Bank's enhanced marketing efforts and continued focus on our Relationships FIRST strategy.\nLoan growth in 2019 was predominantly in the income producing - commercial real estate and owner occupied - commercial real estate loan categories. Despite an increased level of in-market competition for business, the Bank continued to experience strong organic loan production and portfolio growth. Notwithstanding increased supply of units, multi-family commercial real estate leasing in the Bank's market area has held up well, particularly for well-located close-in projects. While as a general comment there has been some softening in the Suburban Maryland office leasing market, in certain well located pockets and submarkets, the sector has evidenced some positive absorption. Overall, commercial real estate values have generally held up well with price escalation in prime pockets, but we continue to be cautious of the cap rates at which some assets are trading and we are being careful with valuations as a result. While the ultra high-end real estate market has softened, the moderately priced housing market has remained stable to increasing, with well-located, Metro accessible properties garnering a premium.\nOwner occupied commercial real estate and construction- C&I (owner occupied) loans represent 14% of the loan portfolio. The Bank has a large portion of its loan portfolio related to real estate, with 78% consisting of commercial real estate and real estate construction loans. When owner occupied commercial real estate and construction- C&I (owner occupied) are excluded, the percentage of total loans represented by commercial real estate decreases to 64%. Real estate also serves as collateral for loans made for other purposes, resulting in 85% of loans being secured or partially secured by real estate.\nThe following table shows the trends in the composition of the loan portfolio over the past five years.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,545,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,553,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,375,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,200,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,052,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income producing -

Although these loans are made to a diversified pool of unrelated borrowers across numerous businesses, adverse developments in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan real estate market could have an adverse impact on this portfolio of loans and the Company's income and financial position. While our basic market area is the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the Bank has made loans outside that market area where the nature and quality of such loans was consistent with the Bank's lending policies. At present, the Company believes that commercial real estate values are stable to improving in those sub-markets of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in which the Company has significant real estate exposure.\nThe federal banking regulators have issued guidance for those institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Pursuant to the supervisory criteria contained in the guidance for identifying institutions with a potential commercial real estate concentration risk, institutions which have (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land acquisitions which represent 100% or more of an institution's total risk-based capital; or (2) total commercial real estate loans representing 300% or more of the institution's total risk-based capital and the institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. The Company, like many community banks, has a concentration in commercial real estate loans, and the Company has experienced growth in its commercial real estate portfolio in recent years. As of December 31, 2019, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans (including construction, land and land development loans) represent 347% of consolidated risk based capital; however, growth in that segment over the past 36 months at 46% does not exceed the 50% threshold laid out in the regulatory guidance. Construction, land and land development loans represent 118% of consolidated risk based capital. Management has extensive experience in commercial real estate lending, and has implemented and continues to maintain heightened risk management procedures, and strong underwriting criteria with respect to its commercial real estate portfolio. Loan monitoring practices include but are not limited to periodic stress testing analysis to evaluate changes to cash flows, owing to interest rate increases and declines in net operating income. Nevertheless, we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of our commercial real estate concentrations, which could require us to obtain additional capital, and may adversely affect shareholder returns. The Company has an extensive Capital Plan and Policy, which includes pro-forma projections including stress testing within which the Board of Directors has established internal minimum targets for regulatory capital ratios that are in excess of well capitalized ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2019, loans to the Accommodation and Food Service industry represent 9% of the loan portfolio compared to 11% as of December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no other concentrations of loans in any one industry exceeding 10% of its total loan portfolio. An industry for this purpose is defined as a group of businesses that are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.\nCertain directors and executive officers have had loan transactions with the Company. Such loans were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with outsiders. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail regarding related party loans.\nLoan Maturity\nThe following table sets forth the time to contractual maturity of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due In\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over One to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over Five to Ten Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over Ten Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,545,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 565,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 775,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 166,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 37,353\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income producing - commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,702,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,150,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,659,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 873,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,183\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owner occupied - commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 985,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 364,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,796\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate mortgage - residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,966\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction - commercial and residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,035,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 716,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 289,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,441\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction - C&I (owner occupied)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,900\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 682\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,545,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,515,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,204,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,622,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 202,338\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans with:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Predetermined fixed interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,063,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 409,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,582,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 974,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 96,404\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floating or Adjustable interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,482,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,105,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,622,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 648,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105,934\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,545,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,515,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,204,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,622,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 202,338\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans are shown in the period based on final contractual maturity. Demand loans, having no contractual maturity, and overdrafts, are reported as due in one year or less.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses represents the amount of expense charged to current earnings to fund the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is based on many factors which reflect management's assessment of the risk in the loan portfolio. Those factors include economic conditions and trends, the value and adequacy of collateral, volume and mix of the portfolio, performance of the portfolio, and internal loan processes of the Company and Bank.\nManagement has developed a comprehensive analytical process to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. This process and guidelines were developed utilizing, among other factors, the guidance from federal banking regulatory agencies. The results of this process, in combination with conclusions of the Bank's outside consultants' review of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, support management's assessment as to the adequacy of the allowance at December 31, 2019. During 2019, a provision for credit losses was made in the amount of $13.1 million and net charge-offs amounted to $9.4 million. A full discussion of the accounting for allowance for credit losses is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and activity in the allowance for credit losses is contained in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, please refer to the discussion under the caption Critical Accounting Policies\u201d within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for further discussion of the methodology which management employs to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses, as well as the discussion under the caption Provision for Credit Losses.\u201d\nThe allowance for credit losses represented 0.98% of total loans at December 31, 2019 as compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the allowance represented 151% of nonperforming loans as compared to 430% at December 31, 2018. The decline in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was due to a higher percentage increase in loans outstanding as compared to the allowance growth. The decrease in the allowance coverage ratio was due to a higher percentage increase in nonperforming loans as compared to the allowance growth. The majority of nonperforming loans are believed to be adequately secured by real estate. Please refer to the Nonperforming Assets\u201d section for a discussion of non performing loans.\nAs part of its comprehensive loan review process, the Bank's Board of Directors, Directors' Loan Committee and Credit Review Committee carefully evaluate loans which are past due 30 days or more. The Committees make a thorough assessment of the conditions and circumstances surrounding delinquent and potential problem loans. The Bank's loan policy requires that loans be placed on nonaccrual if they are 90 days past due, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, Credit Administration specifically analyzes the status of development and construction projects, including sales activities and utilization of interest reserves in order to carefully and prudently assess potential increased levels of risk which may require additional reserves.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had $48.7 million of loans classified as nonperforming, and $20.0 million of additional loans considered potential problem loans, as compared to $16.3 million of nonperforming loans and $102.7 million of potential problem loans at December 31, 2018. The $20.0 million in potential problem loans at December 31, 2019, decreased from $102.7 million at December 31, 2018 due primarily to two commercial real estate secured relationships. Please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Loans\u201d for a discussion of the Company's policy regarding impairment of loans. Please refer to the Nonperforming Assets\u201d section for a discussion of problem and potential problem assets.\nAs the loan portfolio and allowance for credit losses review processes continue to evolve, and with the adoption of CECL, there may be changes to elements of the allowance and this may have an effect on the overall level of the allowance maintained. Historically, the Bank has enjoyed a high quality loan portfolio with relatively low levels of net charge-offs and low delinquency rates. In 2019, the Company experienced an increased level of net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans compared to 2018 (0.13% as compared to 0.05%). The maintenance of a high quality portfolio will continue to be a high priority for both management and the Board of Directors.\nBank management, being aware of the loan growth experienced by the Bank, is intent on maintaining strong portfolio management and a strong risk rating process. The Bank provides analysis of credit requests and the management of problem credits. The Bank has developed and implemented analytical procedures for evaluating credit requests, has refined the Company's risk rating system, and has adopted enhanced monitoring of the loan portfolio (in particular the construction loan portfolio) and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, including stress test analyses. Additionally, fair value assessments of loans acquired is made as part of analytical procedures. The loan portfolio analysis process is ongoing and proactive in order to maintain a portfolio of quality credits and to quickly identify any weaknesses before they become more severe.\nThe following table sets forth activity in the allowance for credit losses for the past five years.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 69,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 64,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 59,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 52,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income producing -

The Company had no accruing loans 90 days or more past due at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018. Management remains attentive to early signs of deterioration in borrowers' financial conditions and to taking the appropriate action to mitigate risk. Furthermore, the Company is diligent in placing loans on nonaccrual status and believes, based on its loan portfolio risk analysis, that its allowance for credit losses at 0.98% of total loans at December 31, 2019, is adequate to absorb potential credit losses within the loan portfolio at that date. Total nonperforming loans amounted to $48.7 million at December 31, 2019, representing 0.65% of total loans, compared to $16.3 million at December 31, 2018, representing 0.23% of total loans. The majority of nonperforming loans are believed to be adequately secured by real estate.\nIncluded in nonperforming assets are loans that the Company considers to be impaired. Impaired loans are defined as those as to which we believe it is probable that we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, as well as those loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR that have not shown a period of performance as required under applicable accounting standards. Valuation allowances for those loans determined to be impaired are evaluated in accordance with ASC Topic 310- Receivables,\u201d and updated quarterly. For collateral dependent impaired loans, the carrying amount of the loan is determined by current appraised value less estimated costs to sell the underlying collateral, which may be adjusted downward under certain circumstances for actual events and/or changes in market conditions. For example, current average actual selling prices less average actual closing costs on an impaired multi-unit real estate project may indicate the need for an adjustment in the appraised valuation of the project, which in turn could increase the associated ASC Topic 310 specific reserve for the loan. Generally, all appraisals associated with impaired loans are updated on a not less than annual basis.\nLoans are considered to have been modified in a TDR when, due to a borrower's financial difficulties, the Company makes unilateral concessions to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Concessions could include interest rate reductions, principal or interest forgiveness, forbearance, and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Alternatively, management, from time-to-time and in the ordinary course of business, implements renewals, modifications, extensions, and/or changes in terms of loans to borrowers who have the ability to repay on reasonable market-based terms, as circumstances may warrant. Such modifications are not considered to be TDRs as the accommodation of a borrower's request does not rise to the level of a concession if the modified transaction is at market rates and terms and/or the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulty. For example: (1) adverse weather conditions may create a short term cash flow issue for an otherwise profitable retail business\nwhich suggests a temporary interest only period on an amortizing loan; (2) there may be delays in absorption on a real estate project which reasonably suggests extension of the loan maturity at market terms; or (3) there may be maturing loans to borrowers with demonstrated repayment ability who are not in a position at the time of maturity to obtain alternate long-term financing. The most common change in terms provided by the Company is an extension of an interest only term. The determination of whether a restructured loan is a TDR requires consideration of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the change in terms, and the exercise of prudent business judgment. The Company had nine TDRs at December 31, 2019, totaling approximately $19.1 million, as compared to twelve TDRs totaling approximately $24.6 million at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, seven of these TDR loans, totaling approximately $16.6 million, are performing under their modified terms, as compared to the same period in 2018, there were nine performing TDR loans totaling approximately $24.0 million. During 2019, there were three performing TDRs totaling $9.5 million that defaulted on their modified terms which were reclassified to nonperforming loans, as compared to the same period in 2018, there were two performing TDR loans totaling approximately $460 thousand that defaulted on their modified terms and were reclassified to nonperforming loans. A default is considered to have occurred once the TDR is past due 90 days or more, or it has been placed on nonaccrual. During 2019, there were three restructured loans totaling approximately $9.5 million, one loan totaling $4.8 million had its collateral property sold for approximately $3 million and the remaining $1.8 million was charged-off during the year, the second loan totaling $2.3 million defaulted on its modified terms and was charged off, the third loan totaling $2.4 million defaulted on its modified terms and migrated to nonperforming. During 2018, there were four defaulted loans totaling approximately $1.4 million that were charged off during the year. During 2019 there was one loan totaling $10.4 million that was re-underwritten into two new loans which provided better collateral for the Bank, and there was one restructured loan totaling approximately $309 thousand that was paid off from the sale proceeds of the collateral property, as compared to 2018, there were two loan payoffs on performing loans totaling approximately $3.9 million that were modified during the year. During 2018, there was a pay down of approximately $176 thousand on one nonperforming loan totaling approximately $183 thousand at December 31, 2017. Commercial and consumer loans modified in a TDR are closely monitored for delinquency as an early indicator of possible future default. If loans modified in a TDR subsequently default, the Company evaluates the loan for possible further impairment. The allowance may be increased, adjustments may be made in the allocation of the allowance, or partial charge-offs may be taken to further write-down the carrying value of the loan. During 2019, there was one loan modified in a TDR totaling approximately $2.3 million, as compared to the same period in 2018, there were two loans totaling approximately $12.8 million modified in a TDR. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.Included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019 is OREO of $1.5 million, consisting of three foreclosed property. Included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2018 was OREO of $1.4 million, consisting of one foreclosed property. OREO properties are carried at fair value less estimated costs to sell. It is the Company's policy to obtain third party appraisals prior to foreclosure, and to obtain updated third party appraisals on OREO properties generally not less frequently than annually. Generally, the Company would obtain updated appraisals or evaluations where it has reason to believe, based upon market indications (such as comparable sales, legitimate offers below carrying value, broker indications and similar factors), that the current appraisal does not accurately reflect current value. During 2019 and 2018, there were no OREO sales.\nThe following table shows the amounts and relevant ratios of nonperforming assets at the dates indicated:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual Loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income producing -

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant variation in the amount of nonperforming loans may occur from period to period because the amount of nonperforming loans depends largely on the condition of a relatively small number of individual credits and borrowers relative to the total loan portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2019, there were $20.0 million of performing loans considered potential problem loans, defined as loans that are not included in the 90 days past due, nonaccrual or restructured categories, but for which known information about possible credit problems causes management to be uncertain as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms which may in the future result in disclosure in the past due, nonaccrual or restructured loan categories. The $20.0 million in potential problem loans at December 31, 2019, decreased from $102.7 million at December 31, 2018 due primarily to two commercial real estate secured relationships. The balance of potential problem loans at December 31, 2019 included $11.9 million of loans that were considered potential problem loans at December 31, 2018. The Company has taken a conservative posture with respect to risk rating its loan portfolio. Based upon their status as potential problem loans, these loans receive heightened scrutiny and ongoing intensive risk management. Additionally, the Company's loan loss allowance methodology incorporates increased reserve factors for certain loans considered potential problem loans as compared to the general portfolio. See the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section for a description of the allowance methodology.\nOther Earning Assets\nResidential mortgage loans held for sale amounted to $56.7 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018. The Company's general practice is to originate and sell such loans only on a servicing released\u201d basis in order to enhance noninterest income. See the Business\u201d section for a description of the Bank's residential mortgage lending and sales activities.\nBOLI is utilized by the Company in accordance with income tax regulations as part of the Company's financing of its benefit programs. At December 31, 2019, this asset amounted to $75.7 million as compared to $73.4 million at December 31, 2018, which reflected the purchase of $580 thousand in additional policies during 2019 and an increase in cash surrender values. Refer to Note 19 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company recognizes a servicing asset for the computed value of servicing fees on the sales of multifamily FHA loans, the guaranteed portion of SBA loans, and other loans sold with retained servicing which is in excess of the normal servicing fees. Assumptions related to loan term and amortization are made to arrive at the initial recorded value, which is included in intangible assets, net, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor 2019, excess servicing fees of $175 thousand were recorded and $246 thousand was amortized as a reduction of actual service fees collected, which is a component of other income. At December 31, 2019, the balance of excess servicing fees was $507 thousand. For 2018, excess servicing fees of $1.8 million were recorded, $672 thousand of the FHA mortgage servicing was sold, and $1.1 million was amortized as a reduction of actual service fees collected, which is a component of other income. At December 31, 2017, the balance of excess servicing fees was $578 thousand.\nIn connection with the acquisitions of Fidelity in 2008 and Virginia Heritage in 2014, the Company allocated a portion of the purchase price to core deposit intangibles, based upon an independent evaluation, and which is included in intangible assets, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the initial and current carrying values as well as additions and amortization. The core deposit intangible is being amortized over its remaining economic life as a component of other noninterest expense.\nIn 2008, the Company recorded an unidentified intangible asset (goodwill) incident to the acquisition of Fidelity of $2.2 million. In 2014, the Company recorded an initial amount of unidentified intangible (goodwill) incident to the acquisition of Virginia Heritage\nof approximately $102 million. The Company's testing of potential goodwill impairment (which is performed annually), has resulted in no impairment being recorded.\nDeposits and Other Borrowings\nThe principal sources of funds for the Bank are core deposits, consisting of demand deposits, money market accounts, NOW accounts, and savings accounts. Additionally, the Bank obtains certificates of deposits from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The deposit base includes transaction accounts, time and savings accounts and accounts which customers use for cash management and which provide the Bank with a source of fee income and cross-marketing opportunities, as well as an attractive source of lower cost funds. To meet funding needs during periods of high loan demand and seasonal variations in core deposits, the Bank utilizes alternative funding sources such as secured borrowings from the FHLB, federal funds purchased lines of credit from correspondent banks and brokered deposits from regional and national brokerage firms and Promontory.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, total deposits increased by $250.1 million or 4% compared to the same period in 2018. Noninterest bearing deposits decreased $39.9 million or 2% to $2.06 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018, while interest bearing deposits increased by $290.0 million, or 6%. Within interest bearing deposits, money market and savings accounts collectively amounted to $3.01 billion at December 31, 2019, or 42% of total deposits, as compared to $2.95 billion, or 42% of total deposits, at December 31, 2018, an increase of $63.6 million, or 2%.\nAverage total deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $7.23 billion, as compared to $6.44 billion for the same period in 2018, a 12% increase.\nApproximately 18% of the Bank's deposits at December 31, 2019 ($1.28 billion) were time deposits, which are generally the most expensive form of deposit because of their fixed rate and term, as compared to 19% at December 31, 2018 ($1.33 billion).\nThe following table sets forth the maturities of time deposits with balances of $250 thousand or more, which represent 5% and 6% of total deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the maturities of time deposits and the Average Balances Table in the Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\u201d section for the average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. Time deposits of $250 thousand or more can be more volatile and more expensive than time deposits of less than $250 thousand. However, because the Bank focuses on relationship banking, and its marketplace demographics are favorable, its historical experience has been that large time deposits have not been more volatile or significantly more expensive than smaller denomination certificates.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits $250,000 or more\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 63,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 51,214\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>More than three months through twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 286,300\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,273\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 350,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 445,787\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFrom time to time, when appropriate in order to fund strong loan demand, the Bank accepts brokered time deposits, generally in denominations of less than $250 thousand, from a regional brokerage firm, and other national brokerage networks, including Promontory. Additionally, the Bank participates in the CDARS and the ICS products, which provides for reciprocal ( two-way\u201d) transactions among banks facilitated by Promontory for the purpose of maximizing FDIC insurance. The total of reciprocal deposits at December 31, 2019 was $502.9 million (7% of total deposits) as compared to $391.7 million at December 31, 2018 (6% of total deposits). These sources are believed by the Company to represent a reliable and cost efficient alternative funding source for the Bank. The Bank also is able to obtain one way CDARS deposits and participates in Promontory's Insured Network Deposit, ( IND\u201d). The Bank had $533.1 million and $544.5 million of IND\u201d brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. However, to the extent that the condition or reputation of the Company or Bank deteriorates, or to the extent that there are significant changes in market interest rates which the Company and Bank do not elect to match, we may experience an outflow of brokered deposits. In that event we would be required to obtain alternate sources for funding.\nAt December 31, 2019, total deposits included $1.80 billion of brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way), which represented 25% of total deposits. At December 31, 2018, total brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way) were $1.36 billion, or 19% of total deposits.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had $2.06 billion in noninterest bearing demand deposits, representing 29% of total deposits. This compared to $2.10 billion of noninterest bearing demand deposits at December 31, 2018 or 30% of total deposits. The Bank also offers business NOW accounts and business savings accounts to accommodate those customers who may have excess short term cash to deploy in interest earning assets.\nAs an enhancement to the basic noninterest bearing demand deposit account, the Company offers a sweep account, or customer repurchase agreement,\u201d allowing qualifying businesses to earn interest on short-term excess funds, which are not suited for either a certificate of deposit or a money market account. The balances in these accounts were $31.0 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $30.4 million at December 31, 2018. Customer repurchase agreements are not deposits and are not insured by the FDIC, but are collateralized by U.S. agency securities and or U.S. agency backed mortgage backed securities. These accounts are particularly suitable to businesses with significant fluctuation in the levels of cash flows. Attorney and title company escrow accounts are examples of accounts which can benefit from this product, as are customers who may require collateral for deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limits but do not qualify for other pledging arrangements. This program requires the Company to maintain a sufficient investment securities level to accommodate the fluctuations in balances which may occur in these accounts.\nThe Company had no outstanding balances under its federal funds lines of credit provided by correspondent banks (which are unsecured) at December 31, 2019 and 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $250.0 million of FHLB advances borrowed as part of the overall asset liability strategy and to support loan growth. The Company did not have FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Outstanding FHLB advances are secured by collateral consisting of a blanket lien on qualifying loans in the Bank's commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios.\nLong-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 include the Company's August 5, 2014 issuance of $70.0 million of subordinated notes, due September 1, 2024 and the Company's July 26, 2016 issuance of $150.0 million of subordinated notes, due August 1, 2026. For additional information on the Company's subordinated notes, please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Capital Resources and Adequacy\u201d section below.\nCOMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's net income was $152.3 million, a 52% increase as compared to the $100.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income per basic and diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $4.44 and $4.42, respectively as compared to $2.94 per basic common share and $2.92 per diluted common share for 2017, an increase of 51% per basic and diluted common share.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company reported a return on average assets, or ROAA, of 1.91% as compared to 1.41% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The return on average common equity, or ROACE, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 14.89%, as compared to 11.06% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The return on average tangible common equity for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 16.63%, as compared to 12.54% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's earnings are largely dependent on net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, which represented 93% and 91% of total revenue for the full year of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe net interest margin, which measures the difference between interest income and interest expense (i.e., net interest income) as a percentage of average earning assets, decreased 5 basis points from 4.15% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 4.10% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average earning asset yields increased by 36 basis points (4.73% to 5.09%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by 67 basis points (to 1.61% from 0.94%). For 2018, in spite of competitive factors, the Company has been able to increase its loan portfolio yields relative to 2017 levels (5.54% as compared to 5.17%) due to disciplined loan pricing practices.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the net interest spread decreased by 31 basis points (to 3.48% from 3.79%) as compared to 2017, due primarily to an increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased in 2018 largely as a result of interest rate increases by the FOMC and increased competition for deposits within our market area. Overall, the Company believes its deposit mix and cost of funds remain favorable. The benefit of noninterest sources funding earning assets increased by 26 basis points to 62 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 36 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of a favorable mix of noninterest bearing deposits. The percentage of average noninterest deposits relative to average total deposits increased to 33% for the full year 2018 from 32% for the same period in 2017.\nThe combination of a 31 basis point decrease in the net interest spread and a 26 basis point increase in the value of noninterest sources resulted in the 5 basis point decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.\nThe provision for credit losses was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs of $3.5 million during 2018 represented 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.3 million or 0.06% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2017.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to $22.6 million from $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 23% decrease.\nThe efficiency ratio, which measures the ratio of noninterest expense to total revenue, remained favorable at 37.31% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 37.84% for the same period in 2017. Total noninterest expenses totaled $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 7% increase. As a percentage of average assets, total noninterest expense was 1.59% for the year of 2018 as compared to 1.67% for the same period in 2017.\nThe ratio of common equity to total assets increased from 12.71% at December 31, 2017 to 13.22% at December 31, 2018 due to growth from earnings.\nNet interest income in 2018 was $317.0 million as compared to $283.9 million in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net interest income increased 12% over the same period for 2017. Average loans increased $698.2 million (12%) and average deposits increased by $656.9 million (11%). The net interest margin was 4.10% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 4.15% for the same period in 2017. The Company has been able to improve its loan yields in 2018 as compared to 2017 levels due to disciplined loan pricing practices, and has managed its funding costs while maintaining a favorable deposit mix; much of which has occurred from sales efforts to increase and deepen client relationships.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased $5.2 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017, reflecting $8.7 million in provision for credit losses and $3.5 million in net charge-offs during 2018. The provision for credit losses was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The lower provisioning during 2018, as compared to 2017, is due to lower loan growth ($579.9 million as compared to $733.6 million) due to higher loan payoffs. Net charge-offs of $3.5 million during 2018 represented 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.3 million or 0.06% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2017. Net charge-offs during 2018 were attributable primarily to commercial loans ($3.2 million).\nAt December 31, 2018 the allowance for credit losses represented 1.00% of loans outstanding, as compared to 1.01% at December 31, 2017. The allowance for credit losses represented 430% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2018, as compared to 489% at December 31, 2017.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $22.6 million as compared to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 23% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to $2.1 million lower revenue on the origination, securitization, servicing, and sale of FHA Multifamily-Backed GNMA securities, a $1.2 million nonrecurring adjustment to a tax credit investment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, a $354 thousand prepayment penalty associated with a single credit that was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017, $269 thousand of premium and servicing income recorded during 2017 resulting from the portfolio sale of $44.3 million in residential mortgages and HELOC's out of the loan portfolio, $3.3 million lower gains on sale of loans, and $445 thousand lower gain on sale of investment securities. The FHA business unit generated income of $357 thousand on the origination, securitization, servicing and sale of FHA Multifamily-Backed GNMA securities for the full year 2018 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2017. The residential mortgage unit had $5.4 million of gains on the sale of loans for the full year of 2018 as compared to $7.8 million for the same period in 2017 resulting from fewer loan originations and subsequent loan sales.\nTotal noninterest expenses totaled $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 7% increase. Salaries and employee benefits were $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $67.1 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of less than 1%. Cost increases for salaries and benefits were due to new hires and merit increases, higher stock-based compensation expense, and higher health insurance costs partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals. At December 31, 2018, the Company's full time equivalent staff numbered 470, as compared to 466 at December 31, 2017.\nPremises and equipment expenses amounted to $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $15.6 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of less than 1%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized $501 thousand of sublease revenue as compared to $455 thousand for the same period in 2017. The sublease revenue is accounted for as a reduction to premises and equipment expenses.\nMarketing and advertising increased from $4.1 million to $4.6 million, an increase of 12%, due primarily to increase digital and print advertising spend. Data processing increased from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $9.7 million for 2018, an increase of 18%, and due primarily to the costs of software and infrastructure investments.\nLegal, accounting and professional fees increased from $5.1 million to $9.7 million, an increase of 93% due primarily to due diligence costs from independent consultants associated with the internet event, related to the short seller claims, late in 2017 as well as costs to enhance risk management systems, including corporate governance as the Company approaches $10 billion in assets.\nFDIC insurance increased $958 thousand to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 38% compared to 2017, primarily due to higher assessment rates and growth in total assets.\nOther expenses decreased to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $15.9 million for the same period in 2017, a decrease of less than 1%. The major components of cost in this category include broker fees, Virginia franchise tax, core deposit intangible amortization, insurance expenses, and director compensation. Cost control remains a significant operating objective of the Company.\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $51.9 million in 2018 compared to $85.5 million in 2017 ($70.9 million on an operating basis), resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.4% and 46.0% (38.2% on an operating basis), respectively. The lower effective tax rate for 2018 was due to a $14.6 million deferred tax asset adjustment charged through tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, and tax credits taken in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting from new tax credit equity investments. While the Company's earnings beginning in 2018 benefitted from the lower corporate federal income tax statutory rates (from 35% to 21%) resulting from the 2017 Tax Act, companies were required to revalue their deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 based upon the reduced federal income tax rates. This adjustment increased income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 by $14.6 million ($0.43 per basic and $0.42 per diluted share). As a result of reduced income tax rates, the Company incurred substantially reduced income tax expense in 2018.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2018 were $8.39 billion, a 12% increase as compared to $7.48 billion at December 31, 2017. Total loans (excluding loans held for sale) were $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018, a 9% increase as compared to $6.41 billion at December 31, 2017. Loans held for sale amounted to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $25.1 million at December 31, 2017, a 23% decrease. The investment portfolio totaled $784.1 million at December 31, 2018, a 33% increase from $589.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nTotal borrowed funds (excluding customer repurchase agreements) were $217.3 million at December 31, 2018 and $541.9 million at December 31, 2017, a 60% decrease due to the $325.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2017 being paid off during 2018.\nTotal shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 increased 17%, to $1.11 billion, from $950.4 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in shareholders' equity from December 31, 2017 was primarily due to increased retained earnings. Growth in retained earnings has enhanced the Company's capital position well in excess of regulatory requirements for well capitalized status. The total risk based capital ratio was 16.08% at December 31, 2018, as compared to 15.02% at December 31, 2017. In addition, the tangible common equity ratio was 12.11% at December 31, 2018, compared to 11.44% at December 31, 2017. The ratio of common equity to total assets was 13.22% at December 31, 2018 as compared to 12.71% at December 31, 2017.\nFederal funds sold amounted to $11.9 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $15.8 million at December 31, 2017. These funds represent excess daily liquidity which is invested on an unsecured basis with well capitalized banks, in amounts generally limited both in the aggregate and to any one bank.\nInterest bearing deposits with banks and other short-term investments amounted to $303.2 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $167.3 million at December 31, 2017. These short term investments represent liquid funds held at the Federal Reserve to meet future loan demand, to fund future increases in investment securities and to meet other general liquidity needs of the Company. The Bank also holds a time deposit amounting to $1.6 million.\nLoan growth over the past year has been favorable, with loans outstanding reaching $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $580 million or 9% as compared to $6.41 billion at December 31, 2017. Loan growth over the last twelve months was due in part to the Bank's enhanced marketing efforts and continued focus on our Relationships FIRST strategy.\nResidential mortgage loans held for sale amounted to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $25.1 million at December 31, 2017.\nBOLI is utilized by the Company in accordance with income tax regulations as part of the Company's financing of its benefit programs. At December 31, 2018, this asset amounted to $73.4 million as compared to $60.9 million at December 31, 2017, which reflected the purchase of $10.0 million in additional policies during 2018 and an increase in cash surrender values.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, total deposits increased by $1.12 billion or 19% compared to the same period in 2017. Noninterest bearing deposits increased $121.3 million or 6% to $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.98 billion at December 31, 2017, while interest bearing deposits increased by $999.0 million, or 26%. Within interest bearing deposits, money market and savings accounts collectively amounted to $2.95 billion at December 31, 2018, or 42% of total deposits, as compared to $2.62 billion, or 45% of total deposits, at December 31, 2017, an increase of $328.4 million, or 13%.\nAt December 31, 2018, total deposits included $1.36 billion of brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way), which represented 19% of total deposits. At December 31, 2017, total brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way) were $935.9 million, or 16% of total deposits.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had $2.10 billion in noninterest bearing demand deposits, representing 30% of total deposits. This compared to $1.98 billion of noninterest bearing demand deposits at December 31, 2017 or 34% of total deposits.\nThe Company had no outstanding balances under its federal funds lines of credit provided by correspondent banks (which are unsecured) at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company did not have FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2017 the Company had $325.0 million of FHLB advances borrowed as part of the overall asset liability strategy and to support loan growth. Outstanding FHLB advances are secured by collateral consisting of a blanket lien on qualifying loans in the Bank's commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios.\nLong-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 include the Company's August 5, 2014 issuance of $70.0 million of subordinated notes, due September 1, 2024 and the Company's July 26, 2016 issuance of $150.0 million of subordinated notes, due August 1, 2026.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments. Except for its loan commitments, as shown in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the following table shows details on these fixed and determinable obligations as of December 31, 2019 in the time period indicated.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Within One\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over Five\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits without a stated maturity (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,941,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,941,352\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 798,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 375,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,283,039\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowed funds (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 280,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500,980\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,467\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outside data processing (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,112\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>George Mason sponsorship (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,826\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>D.C.

These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. They involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.\nVarious commitments to extend credit are made in the normal course of banking business. Letters of credit are also issued for the benefit of customers. These commitments are subject to loan underwriting standards and geographic boundaries consistent with the Company's loans outstanding.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nLoan commitments outstanding and lines and letters of credit at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded loan commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,176,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,228,689\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,283\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,162\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,332,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,402,134\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnfunded loan commitments of $50 million as of December 31, 2019 were related to interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans and were of a short-term nature.\nThe Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary list of loan commitments at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nLoan commitments represent agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract and which have been accepted in writing by the borrower. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral obtained varies, and may include certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential and commercial real estate.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company which guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral held varies as specified above and is required in instances which the Company deems necessary. At December 31, 2019, approximately 82% of the dollar amount of standby letters of credit was collateralized.\nThe Company enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate residential mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. The Bank either locks in the loan and rate with an investor and commits to deliver the loan if settlement occurs under best efforts or commits to deliver the locked loan in a binding mandatory delivery program with an investor. Certain loans under rate lock commitments are covered under forward sales contracts of mortgage backed securities. Forward sales contracts of mortgage backed securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest income. Interest rate lock commitments and commitments to deliver loans to investors are considered derivatives. The market value of interest rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts are not readily ascertainable with precision because they are not actively traded in stand-alone markets. The Company determines the fair value of rate lock commitments and delivery contracts by measuring the fair value of the underlying asset, which is impacted by current interest rates and taking into consideration the probability that the rate lock commitments will close or will be funded.\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap derivative financial instruments to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to certain variable rate deposits. Such instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in other comprehensive income (a Consolidated Balance Sheet component of shareholders' equity) and is reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (i.e. the period when cash flows are exchanged between counterparties). Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not highly effective in hedging the changes in the expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings. Please refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into credit risk participation agreements ( RPAs\u201d) with institutional counterparties, under which the Company assumes its pro-rata share of the credit exposure associated with a borrower's performance related to interest rate derivative contracts. The fair value of RPAs is calculated by determining the total expected asset or liability exposure of the derivatives to the borrowers and applying the borrowers' credit spread to that exposure. Total expected exposure incorporates both the current and potential future exposure of the derivatives, derived from using observable inputs, such as yield curves and volatilities. These derivatives are not designated as hedges, are not speculative, and have a notional value of $27.4 million as of December 31. 2019. The changes in fair value for these contracts are recognized directly in earnings. Please refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nDerivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate caps and swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings. Please refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nIn connection with deposit guarantees, the Bank collateralizes certain public funds using qualified investment securities.\nWith the exception of these off-balance sheet arrangements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, capital expenditures or capital resources, that is material to investors.\nLIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT\nLiquidity is a measure of the Company's and Bank's ability to meet loan demand and to satisfy depositor withdrawal requirements in an orderly manner. The Bank's primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash balances due from correspondent banks, excess reserves at the Federal Reserve, loan repayments, federal funds sold and other short-term investments, maturities and sales of investment securities, income from operations and new core deposits into the Bank. The Bank's investment portfolio of debt securities is held in an available-for-sale status which allows for flexibility, subject to holdings held as collateral for customer repurchase agreements and public funds, to generate cash from sales as needed to meet ongoing loan demand. These sources of liquidity are considered primary and are supplemented by the ability of the Company and Bank to borrow funds or issue brokered deposits, which are termed secondary sources of liquidity and which are substantial. Additionally, the Bank can purchase up to $172.5 million in federal funds on an unsecured basis from its correspondents, against which there were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2019 and can borrow unsecured funds under one-way CDARS and ICS brokered deposits in the amount of $1.34 billion, against which there was $82.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019. The Bank also has a commitment at December 31, 2019 from Promontory to place up\nto $700.0 million of brokered deposits from its IND program in amounts requested by the Bank, as compared to an actual balance of $533.1 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, the Bank was also eligible to make advances from the FHLB up to $1.54 billion based on collateral at the FHLB, of which there was $250 million outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The Bank may enter into repurchase agreements as well as obtain additional borrowing capabilities from the FHLB provided adequate collateral exists to secure these lending relationships. The Bank also has a back-up borrowing facility through the Discount Window at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond ( Federal Reserve Bank\u201d). This facility, which amounts to approximately $653.0 million, is collateralized with specific loan assets identified to the Federal Reserve Bank. It is anticipated that, except for periodic testing, this facility would be utilized for contingency funding only.\nThe loss of deposits, through disintermediation, is one of the greater risks to liquidity. Disintermediation occurs most commonly when rates rise and depositors withdraw deposits seeking higher rates in alternative savings and investment sources than the Bank may offer. The Bank was founded under a philosophy of relationship banking and, therefore, believes that it has less of an exposure to disintermediation and resultant liquidity concerns than do many banks. The Bank makes competitive deposit interest rate comparisons weekly and feels its interest rate offerings are competitive. There is, however, a risk that some deposits would be lost if rates were to increase and the Bank elected not to remain competitive with its deposit rates. Under those conditions, the Bank believes that it is well positioned to use other sources of funds such as FHLB borrowings, brokered deposits, repurchase agreements and correspondent banks' lines of credit to offset a decline in deposits in the short run. Over the long-term, an adjustment in assets and change in business emphasis could compensate for a potential loss of deposits. The Bank also maintains a marketable investment portfolio to provide flexibility in the event of significant liquidity needs. The ALCO has adopted policy guidelines, which emphasize the importance of core deposits, adequate asset liquidity and a contingency funding plan.\nAt December 31, 2019, under the Bank's liquidity formula, it had $4.48 billion of primary and secondary liquidity sources. The amount is deemed adequate to meet current and projected funding needs.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND ADEQUACY\nThe assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as asset quality and mix, liquidity, earnings performance, changing competitive conditions and economic forces, stress testing, regulatory measures and policy, as well as the overall level of growth and complexity of the balance sheet. The adequacy of the Company's current and future capital needs is monitored by management on an ongoing basis. Management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses.\nThe federal banking regulators have issued guidance for those institutions, which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Pursuant to the supervisory criteria contained in the guidance for identifying institutions with a potential commercial real estate concentration risk, institutions which have (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land acquisitions which represent 100% or more of an institution's total risk-based capital; or (2) total commercial real estate loans representing 300% or more of the institution's total risk-based capital and the institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. The Company, like many community banks, has a concentration in commercial real estate loans, and the Company has experienced significant growth in its commercial real estate portfolio in recent years. As of December 31, 2019, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans (including construction, land and land development loans) represent 347% of consolidated risk based capital; however, growth in that segment over the past 36 months at 46% does not exceed the 50% threshold laid out in the regulatory guidance. Construction, land and land development loans represent 118% of consolidated risk based capital. Management has extensive experience in commercial real estate lending, and has implemented and continues to maintain heightened risk management procedures, and strong underwriting criteria with respect to its commercial real estate portfolio.\nLoan monitoring practices include but are not limited to periodic stress testing analysis to evaluate changes to cash flows, owing to interest rate increases and declines in net operating income. Nevertheless, we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of our commercial real estate concentrations, which could require us to obtain additional capital, and may adversely affect shareholder returns. The Company has an extensive Capital Plan and Policy, which includes pro-forma projections including stress testing within which the Board of Directors has established internal policy limits for regulatory capital ratios that are in excess of well capitalized ratios (as defined in the section Regulation\u201d above).\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors and the regulators can lower classifications in certain cases. Failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements.\nThe prompt corrective action regulations provide five categories, including well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If a bank is only adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to, among other things, accept, renew or roll-over brokered deposits. If a bank is undercapitalized, capital distributions and growth and expansion are limited, and plans for capital restoration are required.\nAt December 31, 2019, the capital position of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank, continue to exceed regulatory requirements and guidelines. The primary indicators relied on by bank regulators in measuring the capital position are four ratios as follows: Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Total risk-based capital ratio, the Leverage ratio and the CET1 ratio. Tier 1 capital consists of common and qualifying preferred shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangibles. Total risk-based capital consists of Tier 1 capital, plus qualifying subordinated debt, and the qualifying portion of the allowance for credit losses, and for the Company to a limited extent, excess amounts of restricted core capital elements. Risk-based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk-weighted assets, which are prescribed by regulation. The measure of Tier 1 capital to average assets for the prior quarter is often referred to as the leverage ratio. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is the Tier 1 capital ratio but excluding preferred stock.\nThe Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have adopted the Basel III Rules to implement the Basel III capital guidelines for U.S. banks. The capital rules require a CET1 ratio) of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which when fully phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7.0%; a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%, or 8.5% with the fully phased in capital conservation buffer; a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% with the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer; and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The Basel III Rules also increased risk weights for certain assets and off-balance-sheet exposures. See the Regulation\u201d section for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements.\nThe Company's capital ratios were all well in excess of guidelines established by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bank's capital ratios were in excess of those required to be classified as a well capitalized\u201d institution under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Company's and Bank's capital ratios at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are shown in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe ability of the Company to continue to grow is dependent on its earnings and those of the Bank, the ability to obtain additional funds for contribution to the Bank's capital, through additional borrowings, through the sale of additional common stock or preferred stock, or through the issuance of additional qualifying capital instruments, such as subordinated debt. The capital levels required to be maintained by the Company and Bank may be impacted as a result of the Bank's concentrations in commercial real estate loans. See further detail at the Regulation\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d sections.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods or services.\nNEW AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for New Authoritative Accounting Guidance and their expected impact on the Company's Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources of the Company. The Company's primary subsidiary is the Bank, and the Company's other direct and indirect active subsidiaries are Bethesda Leasing, LLC, Eagle Insurance Services, LLC, and Landroval Municipal Finance, Inc.\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this report.\nCaution About Forward Looking Statements.

The Company provides general commercial and consumer banking services through the Bank, its wholly owned banking subsidiary, a Maryland chartered bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Company was organized in October 1997, to be the holding company for the Bank. The Bank was organized in 1998 as an independent, community oriented, full service banking alternative to the super regional financial institutions, which dominate the Company's primary market area. The Company's philosophy is to provide superior, personalized service to its customers. The Company focuses on relationship banking, providing each customer with a number of services and becoming familiar with and addressing customer needs in a proactive, personalized fashion. The Bank currently has a total of twenty branch offices, including nine in Northern Virginia, six in Suburban Maryland, and five in Washington, D.C.\nThe Bank offers a broad range of commercial banking services to its business and professional clients as well as full service consumer banking services to individuals living and/or working primarily in the Bank's market area. The Bank emphasizes providing commercial banking services to sole proprietors, small and medium-sized businesses, non-profit organizations and associations, and investors living and working in and near the primary service area. These services include the usual deposit functions of commercial banks, including business and personal checking accounts, \"NOW\" accounts and money market and savings accounts, business, construction, and commercial loans, residential mortgages and consumer loans, and cash management services. The Bank is also active in the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans and the origination of SBA loans. The residential mortgage loans are originated for sale to third-party investors, generally large mortgage and banking companies, under best efforts and mandatory delivery commitments with the investors to purchase the loans subject to compliance with pre-established criteria. The Bank generally sells the guaranteed portion of the SBA loans in a transaction apart from the loan origination generating noninterest income from the gains on sale, as well as servicing income on the portion participated. The Company originates multifamily FHA loans through HUD's MAP. The Company securitizes these loans through the Ginnie Mae MBS I program, and sells the resulting securities in the open market to authorized dealers in the normal course of business and periodically bundles and sells the servicing rights. Bethesda Leasing, LLC, a subsidiary of the Bank, holds title to and manages other real estate owned (\"OREO\") assets. Eagle Insurance Services, LLC, a subsidiary of the Bank, offers access to insurance products and services through a referral program with a third party insurance broker. Additionally, the Bank offers investment advisory services through referral programs with third parties. Landroval Municipal Finance, Inc., a subsidiary of the Bank, focuses on lending to municipalities by buying debt on the public market as well as direct purchase issuance.\nAs 2019 began, expectations were high that the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, or FOMC, would continue moving short-term interest rates higher after they adjusted the Federal Funds Target rate up by 25 bps four times over the course of 2018. They also continued their plans for reducing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as U.S. Treasuries and mortgage backed securities mature and that cash flow was not reinvested. Actual GDP growth for 2019 in the U.S. was expected to be slightly below 2018 and after considerable negative market sentiment occurred, the FOMC reversed course and lowered short term rates three times in 2019. It also began increasing its balance sheet to support liquidity in the Federal Funds market. The 2019 U.S. official unemployment rate declined to 3.53% by year end. 2019 saw steady job growth, above average wage growth, an increase in the labor force participation rate, and improved consumer confidence levels. These fundamentals were factored into the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy, but the slowing growth and the lack of inflation led to the three 25 basis point rate cuts in the year. The Federal Reserve Board is currently indicating that this level of monetary policy is appropriate and any changes from here will be data dependent.\nLonger-term U.S. interest rates were much lower in 2019 than expected, with the ten year U.S. Treasury rate averaging 2.15% in 2019 as compared to 2.96% in 2018. The yield curve continued to flatten (two year as compared to ten year U.S. Treasury rates) during 2019 as the long end of the yield curve fell more sharply than the short end. The relative volatility of long-term interest rates was partly a function of attractive yields in U.S. Treasury securities relative to non U.S. bonds, as there remained some perceived weaknesses in European Central Bank economies generally, along with geopolitical risks, and expectations of slowing global growth. Energy prices (oil and natural gas), after a period of low prices in 2016, and a steady climb over the course of 2017 and early 2018 came back down\nbelow 2017 prices by the end of 2018. In 2019, energy prices remained relatively stable at 2018's average price. Inflationary factors remained close to, but still below, the FOMC's target rate of 2.00% throughout 2019.\nAs the ten year U.S. Treasury rate dropped back to 2016 levels in the summer of 2019, the volume of residential mortgage lending began to increase. Overall, real estate values in most of the Company's markets were stable to increasing in 2019 as interest rates remained historically low and job growth and personal income levels rose modestly. Political gridlock continued in Washington, D.C. over concerns of Presidential impeachment, immigration and health care policy, public debt and deficits, as well as tax policy and spending levels. Major corporate and personal tax reform was passed late in 2017, which benefited business earnings and consumer spending, while deficit spending continued and remains a point of serious concern.\nThe Company's primary market, the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, has continued to perform well relative to other parts of the country, due to good growth in the private sector along with increased government spending, and this was no different in 2019. Private sector growth was attributable in part to a diverse economy including a large healthcare component, substantial business services, and a highly educated work force.\nDuring 2019, the Company enhanced its marketplace positioning by remaining proactive in growing client relationships. The Company has had the financial resources to meet, and has remained committed to meeting, the credit needs of its community, resulting in continued growth in the Bank's loan portfolio during 2019. Furthermore, the Company's capital position remained strong in 2019 as a result of very strong and consistent earnings despite higher legal expenses. As a result of the Company's strong capital position and earnings, it was able to initiate a quarterly dividend and to implement a share repurchase program. The Company believes its strategy of remaining growth-oriented, retaining talented staff and maintaining focus on seeking quality lending and deposit relationships has proven successful and is evidenced in its financial and performance ratios. Additionally, the Company believes such focus and strategy of relationship building has fostered future growth opportunities, as the Company's reputation in the marketplace has continued to grow. At December 31, 2019, the Company had total assets of approximately $8.99 billion, total loans of $7.55 billion, total deposits of $7.22 billion and twenty branches in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.\nOperating in the more competitive economic environment of 2019, the Bank was able to produce solid growth in loans. Additionally, the Bank was able to grow its net interest spread earnings, maintain an above average net interest margin in spite of margin compression, retain a strong position regarding asset quality, and generate continued favorable enhanced operating leverage due to its seasoned and professional staff.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies, including for the year ended December 31, 2019 those identified below, inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or a valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility.\nInvestment Securities\nThe fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for investment securities available-for-sale are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available. The Company's investment portfolio is categorized as available-for-sale with unrealized gains and losses net of income tax being a component of shareholders' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two principles of accounting: (a) ASC Topic 450, Contingencies,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and are estimable and (b) ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan. The loss, if any, can be determined by the difference between the loan balance and the value of collateral, the present value of expected future cash flows, or values observable in the secondary markets.\nThree components comprise our allowance for credit losses: a specific allowance, a formula allowance and a nonspecific or environmental factors allowance. Each component is determined based on estimates that can and do change when actual events occur.\nThe specific allowance allocates a reserve to identified impaired loans. Impaired loans are assigned specific reserves based on an impairment analysis. Under ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d a loan for which reserves are individually allocated may show deficiencies in the borrower's overall financial condition, payment record, support available from financial guarantors and for the fair market value of collateral. When a loan is identified as impaired, a specific reserve is established based on the Company's assessment of the loss that may be associated with the individual loan.\nThe formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on internally risk rated loans, exclusive of those identified as requiring specific reserves. The portfolio of unimpaired loans is stratified by loan type and risk assessment. Allowance factors relate to the type of loan and level of the internal risk rating, with loans exhibiting higher risk and loss experience receiving a higher allowance factor.\nThe environmental factors allowance is also used to estimate the loss associated with pools of non-classified loans. These non-classified loans are also stratified by loan type, and environmental allowance factors are assigned by management based upon a number of conditions, including delinquencies, loss history, changes in lending policy and procedures, changes in business and economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, management expertise, concentrations within the portfolio, quality of internal and external loan review systems, competition, and legal and regulatory requirements.\nThe allowance captures losses inherent in the loan portfolio, which have not yet been recognized. Allowance factors and the overall size of the allowance may change from period to period based upon management's assessment of the above described factors, the relative weights given to each factor, and portfolio composition.\nManagement has significant discretion in making the judgments inherent in the determination of the provision and allowance for credit losses, including in connection with the valuation of collateral, a borrower's prospects of repayment, and in establishing allowance factors on the formula and environmental components of the allowance. The establishment of allowance factors involves a continuing evaluation, based on management's ongoing assessment of the global factors discussed above and their impact on the portfolio. The allowance factors may change from period to period, resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount of the provision or allowance, based upon the same volume and classification of loans. Changes in allowance factors can have a direct impact on the amount of the provision, and a related after tax effect on net income. Errors in management's perception and assessment of the global factors and their impact on the portfolio could result in the allowance not being adequate to cover losses in the portfolio, and may result in additional provisions or charge-offs. Alternatively, errors in management's perception and assessment of the global factors and their impact on the portfolio could result in the allowance being in excess of amounts necessary to cover losses in the portfolio, and may result in lower provisions in the future. For additional information regarding the provision for credit losses, refer to the discussion under the caption Provision for Credit Losses\u201d below.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets and MSRs that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights. Intangible assets that have finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and subject to periodic impairment testing. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are amortized to expense using accelerated or straight-line methods over their respective estimated useful lives.\nGoodwill is subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level, which must be conducted at least annually. The Company performs impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired.\nThe Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the goodwill impairment test is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates reflecting the market rate of return, projected growth rates and determination and evaluation of appropriate market comparables. Based on the results of qualitative assessments of all reporting units, the Company concluded that no impairment existed at December 31, 2019. However, future events could cause the Company to conclude that goodwill or other intangibles have become impaired, which would result in recording an impairment loss. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes by recording deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws. If actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. The Company's accounting policy follows the prescribed authoritative guidance that a minimal probability threshold of a tax position must be met before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognized, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management's analysis of tax regulations and interpretations. Significant judgment may be involved in applying the applicable reporting and accounting requirements.\nManagement expects that the Company's adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates due to the requirement that any change in judgment or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which it occurs. Factors that could impact management's judgment include changes in income, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation,\u201d which requires the expense recognition for the fair value of share based compensation awards, such as stock options, restricted stock awards, and performance based shares. This standard allows management to establish modeling assumptions as to expected stock price volatility, option terms, forfeiture rates and dividend rates which directly impact estimated fair value. The accounting standard also allows for the use of alternative option pricing models which may impact fair value as determined. The Company's practice is to utilize reasonable and supportable assumptions.\nDerivatives\nFASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815\u201d), provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain the Company's objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company's net income was $142.9 million, a 6% decrease as compared to $152.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWhere appropriate, parenthetical references refer to operating earnings, which the Company believes are more relevant comparisons to current and historical period results of operations. Reconciliations of 2017 GAAP earnings to operating earnings are contained in the tables under Selected Financial Data\u201d.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net income was $4.18 per basic and diluted common share as compared to $4.44 per basic common share and $4.42 per diluted common share for 2018, a 6% decrease in basic and 5% decrease in diluted earnings per share for the full year of 2019 as compared to 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reported a return on average assets, or ROAA, of 1.61% as compared to 1.91% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The return on average common equity, or ROACE, for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 12.20%, as compared to 14.89% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The return on average tangible common equity, or ROATCE, for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 13.40%, as compared to 16.63% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's earnings are largely dependent on net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, which represented 92% and 93% of total revenue (defined as net interest income plus noninterest income) for the full year of 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe net interest margin, which measures the difference between interest income and interest expense (i.e., net interest income) as a percentage of average earning assets, decreased 33 basis points from 4.10% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 3.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average earning asset yields decreased by 9 basis points (5.09% to 5.00%) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by 34 basis points (to 1.95% from 1.61%). For 2019, in spite of competitive factors, the Company has been able to maintain its loan portfolio yields relatively close to 2018 levels (5.45% as compared to 5.54%) due to disciplined loan pricing practices.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the net interest spread decreased by 43 basis points (to 3.05% from 3.48%) as compared to 2018, due primarily to an increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased in 2019 largely as a result of interest rate increases by the FOMC in mid to late 2018 and increased competition for deposits within our market area, though funding costs started to moderate in the second half of 2019, as the market rate cuts passed through to the liability base. Overall, the Company believes its deposit mix and cost of funds remain favorable. The benefit of noninterest sources funding earning assets increased by 10 basis points to 72 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 62 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of a favorable mix of noninterest bearing deposits. The percentage of average noninterest deposits relative to average total deposits was 31% for the full year 2019 compared to 33% for the same period in 2018.\nThe combination of a 43 basis point decrease in the net interest spread and a 10 basis point increase in the value of noninterest sources resulted in the 33 basis point decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.\nThe Company believes it has effectively managed its net interest margin and net interest income during 2019 as market interest rates (on average) have remained quite low. This factor has been significant to overall earnings performance during the past year as net interest income represented 92% of the Company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe provision for credit losses was $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net charge-offs of $9.4 million during 2019 represented 0.13% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.5 million or 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, the allowance for credit losses represented 0.98% of loans outstanding, as compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. The allowance for credit losses represented 151% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to 430% at December 31, 2018.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $25.7 million from $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 14% increase.\nThe efficiency ratio, which measures the ratio of noninterest expense to total revenue, remained favorable at 39.99% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 37.31% for the same period in 2018. Total noninterest expenses totaled $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 10% increase. As a percentage of average assets, total noninterest expense was 1.58% for the year of 2019 as compared to 1.59% for the same period in 2018.\nThe ratio of common equity to total assets increased from 13.22% at December 31, 2018 to 13.25% at December 31, 2019 due to growth from retained earnings. As discussed under Capital Resources and Adequacy\u201d, the regulatory capital ratios of the Bank and Company remain above well capitalized levels.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets. Earning assets are composed primarily of loans, loans held for sale, investment securities, and interest bearing deposits with banks. The cost of funds represents interest expense on deposits, customer repurchase agreements and other borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB and subordinated notes. Noninterest bearing deposits and capital are other components representing funding sources. Changes in the volume and mix of assets and funding sources, along with the changes in yields earned and rates paid, determine changes in net interest income.\nNet interest income in 2019 was $324.0 million compared to $317.0 million in 2018 and $283.9 million in 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net interest income increased 2% over the same period for 2018. Average loans increased $694.8 million (10%) and average deposits increased by $787.1 million (12%). The net interest margin was 3.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 4.10% for the same period in 2018. The Company has been able to maintain its loan yields in 2019 relatively close to 2018 levels due to disciplined loan pricing practices, and has managed its funding costs while maintaining a favorable deposit mix; much of which has occurred from sales efforts to increase and deepen client relationships. In spite of margin compression, the Company believes its net interest margin remains favorable as compared to its peer banking companies.\nThe table below presents the average balances and rates of the major categories of the Company's assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Included in the table is a measurement of interest rate spread and margin. Interest rate spread is the difference (expressed as a percentage) between the interest rate earned on earning assets less the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities. While the interest rate spread provides a quick comparison of earnings rates as compared to cost of funds, management believes that the net interest margin provides a better measurement of performance. The net interest margin (as compared to the net interest spread) includes the effect of noninterest bearing sources in its calculation and is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nEagle Bancorp, Inc.\nConsolidated Average Balances, Interest Yields And Rates (Unaudited)\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 67: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses represents the amount of expense charged to current earnings to fund the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is based on many factors which reflect management's assessment of the risk in the loan portfolio. Those factors include historical losses, economic conditions and trends, the value and adequacy of collateral, volume and mix of the portfolio, performance of the portfolio, and internal loan processes of the Company and Bank.\nManagement has developed a comprehensive analytical process to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The process and guidelines were developed utilizing, among other factors, the guidance from federal banking regulatory agencies. The results of this process, in combination with conclusions of the Bank's outside loan review consultant, support management's assessment as to the adequacy of the allowance at the balance sheet date. Please refer to the discussion under the caption Critical Accounting Policies\u201d for an overview of the methodology management employs on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance and the provisions charged to expense. Also, refer to the table in the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section that reflects activity in the allowance for credit losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased $3.7 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018, reflecting $13.1 million in provision for credit losses and $9.4 million in net charge-offs during 2019. The provision for credit losses in 2019 compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The higher provisioning during 2019, as compared to 2018, is due to higher net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of $9.4 million during 2019 represented 0.13% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.5 million or 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2018. Net charge-offs during 2019 were attributable primarily to commercial real estate ($5.0 million) and commercial loans ($4.5 million).\nAt December 31, 2019 the allowance for credit losses represented 0.98% of loans outstanding, as compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. The allowance for credit losses represented 151% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to 430% at December 31, 2018.\nAs part of its comprehensive loan review process, the Bank's Board of Directors and Loan Committee or Credit Review Committee carefully evaluate loans which are past-due 30 days or more. The Committees make a thorough assessment of the conditions\nand circumstances surrounding each delinquent loan. The Bank's loan policy requires that loans be placed on nonaccrual if they are ninety days past-due, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, Credit Administration specifically analyzes the status of development and construction projects, sales activities and utilization of interest reserves in order to carefully and prudently assess potential increased levels of risk requiring additional reserves.\nThe maintenance of a high quality loan portfolio, with an adequate allowance for possible credit losses, will continue to be a primary management objective for the Company.\nNoninterest Income\nTotal noninterest income includes service charges on deposits, gain on sale of loans, gain on sale of investment securities, income from bank owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) and other income.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $25.7 million as compared to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 14% increase due to $2.7 million higher gains on sale of residential mortgage loans, $1.4 million higher gain on sale of investment securities, partially offset by $767 thousand lower service charges on deposits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, service charges on deposit accounts decreased $767 thousand to $6.2 million from $7.0 million for the same period in 2018, a decrease of 11%, due primarily to a lower volume of insufficient funds charges.\nGain on sale of loans consists of gains on the sale of SBA and residential mortgage loans. For the year ended December 31, 2019, gain on sale of loans increased from $6.0 million to $8.5 million, an increase of 42%, compared to the same period in 2018.\nThe Company originates residential mortgage loans and utilizes both mandatory delivery\u201d and best efforts\u201d forward loan sale commitments to sell those loans, servicing released. Sales of residential mortgage loans yielded gains of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $5.4 million in the same period in 2018, due to higher origination volume ($665.7 million for 2019 as compared to $415.8 million for 2018) and higher sales volume ($628.2 million for 2019 as compared to $421.6 million in 2018). Loans sold are subject to repurchase in circumstances where documentation is deficient or the underlying loan becomes delinquent or pays off within a specified period following loan funding and sale. The Bank considers these potential recourse provisions to be a minimal risk, but has established a reserve under generally accepted accounting principles for possible repurchases. There were no repurchases due to fraud by the borrower during the year ended December 31, 2019. The reserve amounted to $79 thousand at December 31, 2019 and is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bank does not originate sub-prime\u201d loans and has no exposure to this market segment.\nThe Company is an originator of SBA loans and its practice is to sell the guaranteed portion of those loans at a premium. Income from this source was $309 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $540 thousand for the same period in 2018. Activity in SBA loan sales to secondary markets can vary widely from year to year.\nOther income totaled $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $8.0 million for the same period in 2018, a decrease of 3%.\nNet investment gains amounted to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $97 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe FHA business unit generated income of $501 thousand on the origination, securitization, servicing and sale of FHA Multifamily-Backed GNMA securities for the full year 2019 compared to $357 thousand for the same period in 2018.\nServicing agreements relating to the Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities program require the Company to advance funds to make scheduled payments of principal, interest, taxes and insurance, if such payments have not been received from the borrowers. The Company will generally recover funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements under the FHA insurance and guarantee program. However, in the interim, the Company must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding. The Company must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans. In addition, if a defaulted loan is not cured, the mortgage loan would be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and the Company would not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no funds advanced outstanding under FHA mortgage loan servicing agreements. To the extent the mortgage loans underlying the Company's servicing portfolio experience delinquencies, the Company would be required to dedicate cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts.\nNoninterest Expense\nTotal noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, premises and equipment expenses, marketing and advertising, data processing, legal, accounting and professional fees, FDIC insurance premiums, and other expenses.\nTotal noninterest expenses totaled $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 10% increase. For 2019, the efficiency ratio was 39.99% as compared to 37.31% for the same period in 2018.\nSalaries and employee benefits were $79.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $67.7 million for the same period in 2018, an increase of 18%. Cost increases for salaries and benefits were due primarily to $8.2 million of nonrecurring charges related to acceleration of share based compensation expenses associated with the retirement of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the resignation of certain directors. In addition, $4.0 million of the increase resulted from additional staffing, merit increases, and incentives. At December 31, 2019, the Company's full time equivalent staff numbered 492, as compared to 470 at December 31, 2018.\nPremises and equipment expenses amounted to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $15.7 million for the same period in 2018, a decrease of 8%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $527 thousand of sublease revenue as compared to $501 thousand for the same period in 2018. The sublease revenue is accounted for as a reduction to premises and equipment expenses.\nMarketing and advertising expenses increased to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $4.6 million for the same period in 2018, an increase of 6%, due primarily to increased digital and print advertising spend.\nData processing expenses decreased from $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $9.4 million for 2019, a decrease of 3%, primarily due to ongoing contract renegotiations.\nLegal, accounting and professional fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $12.2 million from $9.7 million in 2018, a 25% increase. The increased expenses were primarily associated with legal fees and expenditures associated with ongoing governmental investigations and related subpoenas and document requests. The Company expects to continue to incur elevated levels of legal and professional fees and expenses in 2020 as it continues to cooperate with these investigations.\nFDIC insurance decreased $306 thousand to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 9% compared to 2018, due to one time premium credits in the second and third quarters of 2019 due to the deposit insurance fund exceeding regulatory levels partially offset by premiums on a larger deposit base.\nOther expenses increased to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $15.8 million for the same period in 2018, an increase of 1%. The major components of cost in this category include broker fees, franchise tax, core deposit intangible amortization, insurance expenses, and director compensation. Cost control remains a significant operating objective of the Company.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $53.8 million in 2019 compared to $51.9 million in 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 27.4% and 25.4%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for 2019 was due primarily to a decrease in federal tax credits, an increase in nondeductible expenses, and adjustments related to the completion of the 2018 tax returns.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nOverview\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 were $8.99 billion, a 7% increase as compared to $8.39 billion at December 31, 2018. Total loans (excluding loans held for sale) were $7.55 billion at December 31, 2019, an 8% increase as compared to $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018. Loans held for sale amounted to $56.7 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018, a 195% increase. The investment portfolio totaled $843.4 million at December 31, 2019, an 8% increase from $784.1 million at December 31, 2018.\nTotal borrowed funds (excluding customer repurchase agreements) were $467.7 million at December 31, 2019 and $217.3 million at December 31, 2018, a 115% increase due to the $250.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nTotal shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 increased 7%, to $1.19 billion from $1.11 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity from December 31, 2018 was primarily due to increased retained earnings. Growth in retained earnings has enhanced the Company's capital position well in excess of regulatory requirements for well capitalized status.\nThe total risk based capital ratio was 16.20% at December 31, 2019, as compared to 16.08% at December 31, 2018. In addition, the tangible common equity ratio was 12.22% at December 31, 2019, compared to 12.11% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of common equity to total assets was 13.25% at December 31, 2019 as compared to 13.22% at December 31, 2018.\nInvestment Securities Available-for-Sale and Short-Term Investments\nThe tables below and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information regarding the Company's investment securities categorized as available-for-sale\u201d, or AFS. The Company classifies all its investment securities as AFS. This classification requires that investment securities be recorded at their fair value with any difference between the fair value and amortized cost (the purchase price adjusted by any discount accretion or premium amortization) reported as a component of shareholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income), net of deferred income taxes. At December 31, 2019, the Company had a net unrealized gain in AFS securities of $4.2 million with a deferred tax liability of $757 thousand, as compared to a net unrealized loss in AFS securities of $9.5 million at December 31, 2018, with a deferred tax asset of $2.8 million.\nThe AFS portfolio is comprised of U.S. agency securities (13% of AFS securities) with an average duration of 2.9 years, seasoned mortgage backed securities that are 100% agency issued (72% of AFS securities) which have an average expected life of 5.5 years with contractual maturities of the underlying mortgages of up to thirty years, municipal bonds (8% of AFS securities) which have an average duration of 4.0 years, U.S. Treasuries (4% of AFS securities) which have an average duration of 0.3 years, corporate bonds (1% of AFS securities) which have an average duration of 5 years, and equity investments which comprise less than 1% of AFS securities. The equity investment consists of common stock of two community banking companies with an estimated fair value of $198 thousand. Ninety eight percent of the investment securities which are debt instruments are rated AAA or AA or have the implicit guarantee of the U.S. Treasury.\nAt December 31, 2019, the investment portfolio amounted to $843.4 million as compared to $784.1 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of 8%. The investment portfolio is managed to achieve goals related to liquidity, income, interest rate risk management and to provide collateral for customer repurchase agreements and other borrowing relationships.\nThe following table provides information regarding the composition of the Company's investment securities portfolio at the dates indicated. Amounts are reported at estimated fair value. The change in composition of the portfolio at December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was due principally to ALCO decisions to buy longer-term municipal investments and increase holdings of U.S. agency securities to better position the Company for the current interest rate environment while maintaining portfolio cash flow and liquidity. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the investment portfolio balances increased as compared to balances at December 31, 2018, as the Bank's deposit growth outpaced loan growth.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.

These funds represent excess daily liquidity which is invested on an unsecured basis with well capitalized banks, in amounts generally limited both in the aggregate and to any one bank.\nInterest bearing deposits with banks and other short-term investments amounted to $195.4 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $303.2 million at December 31, 2018. These short term investments represent liquid funds held at the Federal Reserve to meet future loan demand, to fund future increases in investment securities and to meet other general liquidity needs of the Company. The Bank also holds a time deposit amounting to $1.6 million at December 31, 2019 and $1.6 million at December 31, 2018.\nLoan Portfolio\nIn its lending activities, the Company seeks to develop and expand relationships with clients whose businesses and individual banking needs will grow with the Bank. Superior customer service, local decision making, and accelerated turnaround time from application to closing have been significant factors in growing the loan portfolio, and meeting the lending needs in the markets served, while maintaining sound asset quality.\nLoan growth over the past year has been favorable, with loans outstanding reaching $7.55 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $554 million or 8% as compared to $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018. Loan growth over the last twelve months was due in part to the Bank's enhanced marketing efforts and continued focus on our Relationships FIRST strategy.\nLoan growth in 2019 was predominantly in the income producing - commercial real estate and owner occupied - commercial real estate loan categories. Despite an increased level of in-market competition for business, the Bank continued to experience strong organic loan production and portfolio growth. Notwithstanding increased supply of units, multi-family commercial real estate leasing in the Bank's market area has held up well, particularly for well-located close-in projects. While as a general comment there has been some softening in the Suburban Maryland office leasing market, in certain well located pockets and submarkets, the sector has evidenced some positive absorption. Overall, commercial real estate values have generally held up well with price escalation in prime pockets, but we continue to be cautious of the cap rates at which some assets are trading and we are being careful with valuations as a result. While the ultra high-end real estate market has softened, the moderately priced housing market has remained stable to increasing, with well-located, Metro accessible properties garnering a premium.\nOwner occupied commercial real estate and construction- C&I (owner occupied) loans represent 14% of the loan portfolio. The Bank has a large portion of its loan portfolio related to real estate, with 78% consisting of commercial real estate and real estate construction loans. When owner occupied commercial real estate and construction- C&I (owner occupied) are excluded, the percentage of total loans represented by commercial real estate decreases to 64%. Real estate also serves as collateral for loans made for other purposes, resulting in 85% of loans being secured or partially secured by real estate.\nThe following table shows the trends in the composition of the loan portfolio over the past five years.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,545,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,553,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,375,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,200,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,052,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income producing -

Although these loans are made to a diversified pool of unrelated borrowers across numerous businesses, adverse developments in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan real estate market could have an adverse impact on this portfolio of loans and the Company's income and financial position. While our basic market area is the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the Bank has made loans outside that market area where the nature and quality of such loans was consistent with the Bank's lending policies. At present, the Company believes that commercial real estate values are stable to improving in those sub-markets of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in which the Company has significant real estate exposure.\nThe federal banking regulators have issued guidance for those institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Pursuant to the supervisory criteria contained in the guidance for identifying institutions with a potential commercial real estate concentration risk, institutions which have (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land acquisitions which represent 100% or more of an institution's total risk-based capital; or (2) total commercial real estate loans representing 300% or more of the institution's total risk-based capital and the institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. The Company, like many community banks, has a concentration in commercial real estate loans, and the Company has experienced growth in its commercial real estate portfolio in recent years. As of December 31, 2019, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans (including construction, land and land development loans) represent 347% of consolidated risk based capital; however, growth in that segment over the past 36 months at 46% does not exceed the 50% threshold laid out in the regulatory guidance. Construction, land and land development loans represent 118% of consolidated risk based capital. Management has extensive experience in commercial real estate lending, and has implemented and continues to maintain heightened risk management procedures, and strong underwriting criteria with respect to its commercial real estate portfolio. Loan monitoring practices include but are not limited to periodic stress testing analysis to evaluate changes to cash flows, owing to interest rate increases and declines in net operating income. Nevertheless, we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of our commercial real estate concentrations, which could require us to obtain additional capital, and may adversely affect shareholder returns. The Company has an extensive Capital Plan and Policy, which includes pro-forma projections including stress testing within which the Board of Directors has established internal minimum targets for regulatory capital ratios that are in excess of well capitalized ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2019, loans to the Accommodation and Food Service industry represent 9% of the loan portfolio compared to 11% as of December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no other concentrations of loans in any one industry exceeding 10% of its total loan portfolio.

Demand loans, having no contractual maturity, and overdrafts, are reported as due in one year or less.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses represents the amount of expense charged to current earnings to fund the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is based on many factors which reflect management's assessment of the risk in the loan portfolio. Those factors include economic conditions and trends, the value and adequacy of collateral, volume and mix of the portfolio, performance of the portfolio, and internal loan processes of the Company and Bank.\nManagement has developed a comprehensive analytical process to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. This process and guidelines were developed utilizing, among other factors, the guidance from federal banking regulatory agencies. The results of this process, in combination with conclusions of the Bank's outside consultants' review of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, support management's assessment as to the adequacy of the allowance at December 31, 2019. During 2019, a provision for credit losses was made in the amount of $13.1 million and net charge-offs amounted to $9.4 million. A full discussion of the accounting for allowance for credit losses is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and activity in the allowance for credit losses is contained in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, please refer to the discussion under the caption Critical Accounting Policies\u201d within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for further discussion of the methodology which management employs to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses, as well as the discussion under the caption Provision for Credit Losses.\u201d\nThe allowance for credit losses represented 0.98% of total loans at December 31, 2019 as compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the allowance represented 151% of nonperforming loans as compared to 430% at December 31, 2018. The decline in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was due to a higher percentage increase in loans outstanding as compared to the allowance growth. The decrease in the allowance coverage ratio was due to a higher percentage increase in nonperforming loans as compared to the allowance growth. The majority of nonperforming loans are believed to be adequately secured by real estate. Please refer to the Nonperforming Assets\u201d section for a discussion of non performing loans.\nAs part of its comprehensive loan review process, the Bank's Board of Directors, Directors' Loan Committee and Credit Review Committee carefully evaluate loans which are past due 30 days or more. The Committees make a thorough assessment of the conditions and circumstances surrounding delinquent and potential problem loans. The Bank's loan policy requires that loans be placed on nonaccrual if they are 90 days past due, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, Credit Administration specifically analyzes the status of development and construction projects, including sales activities and utilization of interest reserves in order to carefully and prudently assess potential increased levels of risk which may require additional reserves.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had $48.7 million of loans classified as nonperforming, and $20.0 million of additional loans considered potential problem loans, as compared to $16.3 million of nonperforming loans and $102.7 million of potential problem loans at December 31, 2018. The $20.0 million in potential problem loans at December 31, 2019, decreased from $102.7 million at December 31, 2018 due primarily to two commercial real estate secured relationships. Please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Loans\u201d for a discussion of the Company's policy regarding impairment of loans. Please refer to the Nonperforming Assets\u201d section for a discussion of problem and potential problem assets.\nAs the loan portfolio and allowance for credit losses review processes continue to evolve, and with the adoption of CECL, there may be changes to elements of the allowance and this may have an effect on the overall level of the allowance maintained. Historically, the Bank has enjoyed a high quality loan portfolio with relatively low levels of net charge-offs and low delinquency rates. In 2019, the Company experienced an increased level of net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans compared to 2018 (0.13% as compared to 0.05%). The maintenance of a high quality portfolio will continue to be a high priority for both management and the Board of Directors.\nBank management, being aware of the loan growth experienced by the Bank, is intent on maintaining strong portfolio management and a strong risk rating process. The Bank provides analysis of credit requests and the management of problem credits. The Bank has developed and implemented analytical procedures for evaluating credit requests, has refined the Company's risk rating system, and has adopted enhanced monitoring of the loan portfolio (in particular the construction loan portfolio) and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, including stress test analyses. Additionally, fair value assessments of loans acquired is made as part of analytical procedures. The loan portfolio analysis process is ongoing and proactive in order to maintain a portfolio of quality credits and to quickly identify any weaknesses before they become more severe.\nThe following table sets forth activity in the allowance for credit losses for the past five years.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 69,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 64,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 59,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 52,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income producing -

The Company had no accruing loans 90 days or more past due at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018. Management remains attentive to early signs of deterioration in borrowers' financial conditions and to taking the appropriate action to mitigate risk. Furthermore, the Company is diligent in placing loans on nonaccrual status and believes, based on its loan portfolio risk analysis, that its allowance for credit losses at 0.98% of total loans at December 31, 2019, is adequate to absorb potential credit losses within the loan portfolio at that date. Total nonperforming loans amounted to $48.7 million at December 31, 2019, representing 0.65% of total loans, compared to $16.3 million at December 31, 2018, representing 0.23% of total loans. The majority of nonperforming loans are believed to be adequately secured by real estate.\nIncluded in nonperforming assets are loans that the Company considers to be impaired. Impaired loans are defined as those as to which we believe it is probable that we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, as well as those loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR that have not shown a period of performance as required under applicable accounting standards. Valuation allowances for those loans determined to be impaired are evaluated in accordance with ASC Topic 310- Receivables,\u201d and updated quarterly. For collateral dependent impaired loans, the carrying amount of the loan is determined by current appraised value less estimated costs to sell the underlying collateral, which may be adjusted downward under certain circumstances for actual events and/or changes in market conditions. For example, current average actual selling prices less average actual closing costs on an impaired multi-unit real estate project may indicate the need for an adjustment in the appraised valuation of the project, which in turn could increase the associated ASC Topic 310 specific reserve for the loan. Generally, all appraisals associated with impaired loans are updated on a not less than annual basis.\nLoans are considered to have been modified in a TDR when, due to a borrower's financial difficulties, the Company makes unilateral concessions to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Concessions could include interest rate reductions, principal or interest forgiveness, forbearance, and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Alternatively, management, from time-to-time and in the ordinary course of business, implements renewals, modifications, extensions, and/or changes in terms of loans to borrowers who have the ability to repay on reasonable market-based terms, as circumstances may warrant. Such modifications are not considered to be TDRs as the accommodation of a borrower's request does not rise to the level of a concession if the modified transaction is at market rates and terms and/or the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulty. For example: (1) adverse weather conditions may create a short term cash flow issue for an otherwise profitable retail business\nwhich suggests a temporary interest only period on an amortizing loan; (2) there may be delays in absorption on a real estate project which reasonably suggests extension of the loan maturity at market terms; or (3) there may be maturing loans to borrowers with demonstrated repayment ability who are not in a position at the time of maturity to obtain alternate long-term financing. The most common change in terms provided by the Company is an extension of an interest only term. The determination of whether a restructured loan is a TDR requires consideration of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the change in terms, and the exercise of prudent business judgment. The Company had nine TDRs at December 31, 2019, totaling approximately $19.1 million, as compared to twelve TDRs totaling approximately $24.6 million at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, seven of these TDR loans, totaling approximately $16.6 million, are performing under their modified terms, as compared to the same period in 2018, there were nine performing TDR loans totaling approximately $24.0 million. During 2019, there were three performing TDRs totaling $9.5 million that defaulted on their modified terms which were reclassified to nonperforming loans, as compared to the same period in 2018, there were two performing TDR loans totaling approximately $460 thousand that defaulted on their modified terms and were reclassified to nonperforming loans. A default is considered to have occurred once the TDR is past due 90 days or more, or it has been placed on nonaccrual. During 2019, there were three restructured loans totaling approximately $9.5 million, one loan totaling $4.8 million had its collateral property sold for approximately $3 million and the remaining $1.8 million was charged-off during the year, the second loan totaling $2.3 million defaulted on its modified terms and was charged off, the third loan totaling $2.4 million defaulted on its modified terms and migrated to nonperforming. During 2018, there were four defaulted loans totaling approximately $1.4 million that were charged off during the year. During 2019 there was one loan totaling $10.4 million that was re-underwritten into two new loans which provided better collateral for the Bank, and there was one restructured loan totaling approximately $309 thousand that was paid off from the sale proceeds of the collateral property, as compared to 2018, there were two loan payoffs on performing loans totaling approximately $3.9 million that were modified during the year. During 2018, there was a pay down of approximately $176 thousand on one nonperforming loan totaling approximately $183 thousand at December 31, 2017. Commercial and consumer loans modified in a TDR are closely monitored for delinquency as an early indicator of possible future default. If loans modified in a TDR subsequently default, the Company evaluates the loan for possible further impairment. The allowance may be increased, adjustments may be made in the allocation of the allowance, or partial charge-offs may be taken to further write-down the carrying value of the loan. During 2019, there was one loan modified in a TDR totaling approximately $2.3 million, as compared to the same period in 2018, there were two loans totaling approximately $12.8 million modified in a TDR. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.Included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019 is OREO of $1.5 million, consisting of three foreclosed property. Included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2018 was OREO of $1.4 million, consisting of one foreclosed property. OREO properties are carried at fair value less estimated costs to sell. It is the Company's policy to obtain third party appraisals prior to foreclosure, and to obtain updated third party appraisals on OREO properties generally not less frequently than annually. Generally, the Company would obtain updated appraisals or evaluations where it has reason to believe, based upon market indications (such as comparable sales, legitimate offers below carrying value, broker indications and similar factors), that the current appraisal does not accurately reflect current value. During 2019 and 2018, there were no OREO sales.\nThe following table shows the amounts and relevant ratios of nonperforming assets at the dates indicated:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual Loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income producing -

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status. \nSignificant variation in the amount of nonperforming loans may occur from period to period because the amount of nonperforming loans depends largely on the condition of a relatively small number of individual credits and borrowers relative to the total loan portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2019, there were $20.0 million of performing loans considered potential problem loans, defined as loans that are not included in the 90 days past due, nonaccrual or restructured categories, but for which known information about possible credit problems causes management to be uncertain as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms which may in the future result in disclosure in the past due, nonaccrual or restructured loan categories. The $20.0 million in potential problem loans at December 31, 2019, decreased from $102.7 million at December 31, 2018 due primarily to two commercial real estate secured relationships. The balance of potential problem loans at December 31, 2019 included $11.9 million of loans that were considered potential problem loans at December 31, 2018. The Company has taken a conservative posture with respect to risk rating its loan portfolio. Based upon their status as potential problem loans, these loans receive heightened scrutiny and ongoing intensive risk management. Additionally, the Company's loan loss allowance methodology incorporates increased reserve factors for certain loans considered potential problem loans as compared to the general portfolio. See the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section for a description of the allowance methodology.\nOther Earning Assets\nResidential mortgage loans held for sale amounted to $56.7 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018. The Company's general practice is to originate and sell such loans only on a servicing released\u201d basis in order to enhance noninterest income. See the Business\u201d section for a description of the Bank's residential mortgage lending and sales activities.\nBOLI is utilized by the Company in accordance with income tax regulations as part of the Company's financing of its benefit programs. At December 31, 2019, this asset amounted to $75.7 million as compared to $73.4 million at December 31, 2018, which reflected the purchase of $580 thousand in additional policies during 2019 and an increase in cash surrender values. Refer to Note 19 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company recognizes a servicing asset for the computed value of servicing fees on the sales of multifamily FHA loans, the guaranteed portion of SBA loans, and other loans sold with retained servicing which is in excess of the normal servicing fees. Assumptions related to loan term and amortization are made to arrive at the initial recorded value, which is included in intangible assets, net, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor 2019, excess servicing fees of $175 thousand were recorded and $246 thousand was amortized as a reduction of actual service fees collected, which is a component of other income. At December 31, 2019, the balance of excess servicing fees was $507 thousand. For 2018, excess servicing fees of $1.8 million were recorded, $672 thousand of the FHA mortgage servicing was sold, and $1.1 million was amortized as a reduction of actual service fees collected, which is a component of other income. At December 31, 2017, the balance of excess servicing fees was $578 thousand.\nIn connection with the acquisitions of Fidelity in 2008 and Virginia Heritage in 2014, the Company allocated a portion of the purchase price to core deposit intangibles, based upon an independent evaluation, and which is included in intangible assets, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the initial and current carrying values as well as additions and amortization. The core deposit intangible is being amortized over its remaining economic life as a component of other noninterest expense.\nIn 2008, the Company recorded an unidentified intangible asset (goodwill) incident to the acquisition of Fidelity of $2.2 million. In 2014, the Company recorded an initial amount of unidentified intangible (goodwill) incident to the acquisition of Virginia Heritage\nof approximately $102 million. The Company's testing of potential goodwill impairment (which is performed annually), has resulted in no impairment being recorded.\nDeposits and Other Borrowings\nThe principal sources of funds for the Bank are core deposits, consisting of demand deposits, money market accounts, NOW accounts, and savings accounts. Additionally, the Bank obtains certificates of deposits from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The deposit base includes transaction accounts, time and savings accounts and accounts which customers use for cash management and which provide the Bank with a source of fee income and cross-marketing opportunities, as well as an attractive source of lower cost funds. To meet funding needs during periods of high loan demand and seasonal variations in core deposits, the Bank utilizes alternative funding sources such as secured borrowings from the FHLB, federal funds purchased lines of credit from correspondent banks and brokered deposits from regional and national brokerage firms and Promontory.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, total deposits increased by $250.1 million or 4% compared to the same period in 2018. Noninterest bearing deposits decreased $39.9 million or 2% to $2.06 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018, while interest bearing deposits increased by $290.0 million, or 6%. Within interest bearing deposits, money market and savings accounts collectively amounted to $3.01 billion at December 31, 2019, or 42% of total deposits, as compared to $2.95 billion, or 42% of total deposits, at December 31, 2018, an increase of $63.6 million, or 2%.\nAverage total deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $7.23 billion, as compared to $6.44 billion for the same period in 2018, a 12% increase.\nApproximately 18% of the Bank's deposits at December 31, 2019 ($1.28 billion) were time deposits, which are generally the most expensive form of deposit because of their fixed rate and term, as compared to 19% at December 31, 2018 ($1.33 billion).\nThe following table sets forth the maturities of time deposits with balances of $250 thousand or more, which represent 5% and 6% of total deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the maturities of time deposits and the Average Balances Table in the Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\u201d section for the average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. Time deposits of $250 thousand or more can be more volatile and more expensive than time deposits of less than $250 thousand. However, because the Bank focuses on relationship banking, and its marketplace demographics are favorable, its historical experience has been that large time deposits have not been more volatile or significantly more expensive than smaller denomination certificates.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits $250,000 or more\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 63,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 51,214\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>More than three months through twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 286,300\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over twelve months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,273\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 350,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 445,787\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFrom time to time, when appropriate in order to fund strong loan demand, the Bank accepts brokered time deposits, generally in denominations of less than $250 thousand, from a regional brokerage firm, and other national brokerage networks, including Promontory. Additionally, the Bank participates in the CDARS and the ICS products, which provides for reciprocal ( two-way\u201d) transactions among banks facilitated by Promontory for the purpose of maximizing FDIC insurance. The total of reciprocal deposits at December 31, 2019 was $502.9 million (7% of total deposits) as compared to $391.7 million at December 31, 2018 (6% of total deposits). These sources are believed by the Company to represent a reliable and cost efficient alternative funding source for the Bank. The Bank also is able to obtain one way CDARS deposits and participates in Promontory's Insured Network Deposit, ( IND\u201d). The Bank had $533.1 million and $544.5 million of IND\u201d brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. However, to the extent that the condition or reputation of the Company or Bank deteriorates, or to the extent that there are significant changes in market interest rates which the Company and Bank do not elect to match, we may experience an outflow of brokered deposits. In that event we would be required to obtain alternate sources for funding.\nAt December 31, 2019, total deposits included $1.80 billion of brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way), which represented 25% of total deposits. At December 31, 2018, total brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way) were $1.36 billion, or 19% of total deposits.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had $2.06 billion in noninterest bearing demand deposits, representing 29% of total deposits. This compared to $2.10 billion of noninterest bearing demand deposits at December 31, 2018 or 30% of total deposits. The Bank also offers business NOW accounts and business savings accounts to accommodate those customers who may have excess short term cash to deploy in interest earning assets.\nAs an enhancement to the basic noninterest bearing demand deposit account, the Company offers a sweep account, or customer repurchase agreement,\u201d allowing qualifying businesses to earn interest on short-term excess funds, which are not suited for either a certificate of deposit or a money market account. The balances in these accounts were $31.0 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $30.4 million at December 31, 2018. Customer repurchase agreements are not deposits and are not insured by the FDIC, but are collateralized by U.S. agency securities and or U.S. agency backed mortgage backed securities. These accounts are particularly suitable to businesses with significant fluctuation in the levels of cash flows. Attorney and title company escrow accounts are examples of accounts which can benefit from this product, as are customers who may require collateral for deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limits but do not qualify for other pledging arrangements. This program requires the Company to maintain a sufficient investment securities level to accommodate the fluctuations in balances which may occur in these accounts.\nThe Company had no outstanding balances under its federal funds lines of credit provided by correspondent banks (which are unsecured) at December 31, 2019 and 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $250.0 million of FHLB advances borrowed as part of the overall asset liability strategy and to support loan growth. The Company did not have FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Outstanding FHLB advances are secured by collateral consisting of a blanket lien on qualifying loans in the Bank's commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios.\nLong-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 include the Company's August 5, 2014 issuance of $70.0 million of subordinated notes, due September 1, 2024 and the Company's July 26, 2016 issuance of $150.0 million of subordinated notes, due August 1, 2026. For additional information on the Company's subordinated notes, please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Capital Resources and Adequacy\u201d section below.\nCOMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's net income was $152.3 million, a 52% increase as compared to the $100.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income per basic and diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $4.44 and $4.42, respectively as compared to $2.94 per basic common share and $2.92 per diluted common share for 2017, an increase of 51% per basic and diluted common share.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company reported a return on average assets, or ROAA, of 1.91% as compared to 1.41% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The return on average common equity, or ROACE, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 14.89%, as compared to 11.06% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The return on average tangible common equity for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 16.63%, as compared to 12.54% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's earnings are largely dependent on net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, which represented 93% and 91% of total revenue for the full year of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe net interest margin, which measures the difference between interest income and interest expense (i.e., net interest income) as a percentage of average earning assets, decreased 5 basis points from 4.15% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 4.10% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average earning asset yields increased by 36 basis points (4.73% to 5.09%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by 67 basis points (to 1.61% from 0.94%). For 2018, in spite of competitive factors, the Company has been able to increase its loan portfolio yields relative to 2017 levels (5.54% as compared to 5.17%) due to disciplined loan pricing practices.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the net interest spread decreased by 31 basis points (to 3.48% from 3.79%) as compared to 2017, due primarily to an increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased in 2018 largely as a result of interest rate increases by the FOMC and increased competition for deposits within our market area. Overall, the Company believes its deposit mix and cost of funds remain favorable. The benefit of noninterest sources funding earning assets increased by 26 basis points to 62 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 36 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of a favorable mix of noninterest bearing deposits. The percentage of average noninterest deposits relative to average total deposits increased to 33% for the full year 2018 from 32% for the same period in 2017.\nThe combination of a 31 basis point decrease in the net interest spread and a 26 basis point increase in the value of noninterest sources resulted in the 5 basis point decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.\nThe provision for credit losses was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs of $3.5 million during 2018 represented 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.3 million or 0.06% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2017.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to $22.6 million from $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 23% decrease.\nThe efficiency ratio, which measures the ratio of noninterest expense to total revenue, remained favorable at 37.31% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 37.84% for the same period in 2017. Total noninterest expenses totaled $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 7% increase. As a percentage of average assets, total noninterest expense was 1.59% for the year of 2018 as compared to 1.67% for the same period in 2017.\nThe ratio of common equity to total assets increased from 12.71% at December 31, 2017 to 13.22% at December 31, 2018 due to growth from earnings.\nNet interest income in 2018 was $317.0 million as compared to $283.9 million in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net interest income increased 12% over the same period for 2017. Average loans increased $698.2 million (12%) and average deposits increased by $656.9 million (11%). The net interest margin was 4.10% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 4.15% for the same period in 2017. The Company has been able to improve its loan yields in 2018 as compared to 2017 levels due to disciplined loan pricing practices, and has managed its funding costs while maintaining a favorable deposit mix; much of which has occurred from sales efforts to increase and deepen client relationships.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased $5.2 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017, reflecting $8.7 million in provision for credit losses and $3.5 million in net charge-offs during 2018. The provision for credit losses was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The lower provisioning during 2018, as compared to 2017, is due to lower loan growth ($579.9 million as compared to $733.6 million) due to higher loan payoffs. Net charge-offs of $3.5 million during 2018 represented 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.3 million or 0.06% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2017. Net charge-offs during 2018 were attributable primarily to commercial loans ($3.2 million).\nAt December 31, 2018 the allowance for credit losses represented 1.00% of loans outstanding, as compared to 1.01% at December 31, 2017. The allowance for credit losses represented 430% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2018, as compared to 489% at December 31, 2017.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $22.6 million as compared to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 23% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to $2.1 million lower revenue on the origination, securitization, servicing, and sale of FHA Multifamily-Backed GNMA securities, a $1.2 million nonrecurring adjustment to a tax credit investment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, a $354 thousand prepayment penalty associated with a single credit that was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017, $269 thousand of premium and servicing income recorded during 2017 resulting from the portfolio sale of $44.3 million in residential mortgages and HELOC's out of the loan portfolio, $3.3 million lower gains on sale of loans, and $445 thousand lower gain on sale of investment securities. The FHA business unit generated income of $357 thousand on the origination, securitization, servicing and sale of FHA Multifamily-Backed GNMA securities for the full year 2018 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2017. The residential mortgage unit had $5.4 million of gains on the sale of loans for the full year of 2018 as compared to $7.8 million for the same period in 2017 resulting from fewer loan originations and subsequent loan sales.\nTotal noninterest expenses totaled $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 7% increase. Salaries and employee benefits were $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $67.1 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of less than 1%. Cost increases for salaries and benefits were due to new hires and merit increases, higher stock-based compensation expense, and higher health insurance costs partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals. At December 31, 2018, the Company's full time equivalent staff numbered 470, as compared to 466 at December 31, 2017.\nPremises and equipment expenses amounted to $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $15.6 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of less than 1%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized $501 thousand of sublease revenue as compared to $455 thousand for the same period in 2017. The sublease revenue is accounted for as a reduction to premises and equipment expenses.\nMarketing and advertising increased from $4.1 million to $4.6 million, an increase of 12%, due primarily to increase digital and print advertising spend. Data processing increased from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $9.7 million for 2018, an increase of 18%, and due primarily to the costs of software and infrastructure investments.\nLegal, accounting and professional fees increased from $5.1 million to $9.7 million, an increase of 93% due primarily to due diligence costs from independent consultants associated with the internet event, related to the short seller claims, late in 2017 as well as costs to enhance risk management systems, including corporate governance as the Company approaches $10 billion in assets.\nFDIC insurance increased $958 thousand to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 38% compared to 2017, primarily due to higher assessment rates and growth in total assets.\nOther expenses decreased to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $15.9 million for the same period in 2017, a decrease of less than 1%. The major components of cost in this category include broker fees, Virginia franchise tax, core deposit intangible amortization, insurance expenses, and director compensation. Cost control remains a significant operating objective of the Company.\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $51.9 million in 2018 compared to $85.5 million in 2017 ($70.9 million on an operating basis), resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.4% and 46.0% (38.2% on an operating basis), respectively. The lower effective tax rate for 2018 was due to a $14.6 million deferred tax asset adjustment charged through tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, and tax credits taken in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting from new tax credit equity investments. While the Company's earnings beginning in 2018 benefitted from the lower corporate federal income tax statutory rates (from 35% to 21%) resulting from the 2017 Tax Act, companies were required to revalue their deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 based upon the reduced federal income tax rates. This adjustment increased income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 by $14.6 million ($0.43 per basic and $0.42 per diluted share). As a result of reduced income tax rates, the Company incurred substantially reduced income tax expense in 2018.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2018 were $8.39 billion, a 12% increase as compared to $7.48 billion at December 31, 2017. Total loans (excluding loans held for sale) were $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018, a 9% increase as compared to $6.41 billion at December 31, 2017. Loans held for sale amounted to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $25.1 million at December 31, 2017, a 23% decrease. The investment portfolio totaled $784.1 million at December 31, 2018, a 33% increase from $589.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nTotal borrowed funds (excluding customer repurchase agreements) were $217.3 million at December 31, 2018 and $541.9 million at December 31, 2017, a 60% decrease due to the $325.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2017 being paid off during 2018.\nTotal shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 increased 17%, to $1.11 billion, from $950.4 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in shareholders' equity from December 31, 2017 was primarily due to increased retained earnings. Growth in retained earnings has enhanced the Company's capital position well in excess of regulatory requirements for well capitalized status. The total risk based capital ratio was 16.08% at December 31, 2018, as compared to 15.02% at December 31, 2017. In addition, the tangible common equity ratio was 12.11% at December 31, 2018, compared to 11.44% at December 31, 2017. The ratio of common equity to total assets was 13.22% at December 31, 2018 as compared to 12.71% at December 31, 2017.\nFederal funds sold amounted to $11.9 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $15.8 million at December 31, 2017. These funds represent excess daily liquidity which is invested on an unsecured basis with well capitalized banks, in amounts generally limited both in the aggregate and to any one bank.\nInterest bearing deposits with banks and other short-term investments amounted to $303.2 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $167.3 million at December 31, 2017. These short term investments represent liquid funds held at the Federal Reserve to meet future loan demand, to fund future increases in investment securities and to meet other general liquidity needs of the Company. The Bank also holds a time deposit amounting to $1.6 million.\nLoan growth over the past year has been favorable, with loans outstanding reaching $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $580 million or 9% as compared to $6.41 billion at December 31, 2017. Loan growth over the last twelve months was due in part to the Bank's enhanced marketing efforts and continued focus on our Relationships FIRST strategy.\nResidential mortgage loans held for sale amounted to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $25.1 million at December 31, 2017.\nBOLI is utilized by the Company in accordance with income tax regulations as part of the Company's financing of its benefit programs. At December 31, 2018, this asset amounted to $73.4 million as compared to $60.9 million at December 31, 2017, which reflected the purchase of $10.0 million in additional policies during 2018 and an increase in cash surrender values.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, total deposits increased by $1.12 billion or 19% compared to the same period in 2017. Noninterest bearing deposits increased $121.3 million or 6% to $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.98 billion at December 31, 2017, while interest bearing deposits increased by $999.0 million, or 26%. Within interest bearing deposits, money market and savings accounts collectively amounted to $2.95 billion at December 31, 2018, or 42% of total deposits, as compared to $2.62 billion, or 45% of total deposits, at December 31, 2017, an increase of $328.4 million, or 13%.\nAt December 31, 2018, total deposits included $1.36 billion of brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way), which represented 19% of total deposits. At December 31, 2017, total brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way) were $935.9 million, or 16% of total deposits.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had $2.10 billion in noninterest bearing demand deposits, representing 30% of total deposits. This compared to $1.98 billion of noninterest bearing demand deposits at December 31, 2017 or 34% of total deposits.\nThe Company had no outstanding balances under its federal funds lines of credit provided by correspondent banks (which are unsecured) at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company did not have FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2017 the Company had $325.0 million of FHLB advances borrowed as part of the overall asset liability strategy and to support loan growth. Outstanding FHLB advances are secured by collateral consisting of a blanket lien on qualifying loans in the Bank's commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios.\nLong-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 include the Company's August 5, 2014 issuance of $70.0 million of subordinated notes, due September 1, 2024 and the Company's July 26, 2016 issuance of $150.0 million of subordinated notes, due August 1, 2026.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments. Except for its loan commitments, as shown in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the following table shows details on these fixed and determinable obligations as of December 31, 2019 in the time period indicated.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Within One\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over Five\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits without a stated maturity (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,941,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,941,352\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 798,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 375,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,283,039\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowed funds (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 280,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500,980\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,467\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outside data processing (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,112\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>George Mason sponsorship (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,826\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>D.C.

Should the Bank elect to exercise its right to terminate the George Mason contract, contractual obligations would decrease $3.5 million and $3.6 million for the first option period (years 11-15) and the second option period (16-20), respectively. \n (5) Marketing sponsorship agreement with D.C. United. \n (6) Low Income Housing Tax Credits ( LIHTC\u201d) expected payments for unfunded affordable housing commitments. \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK\nThe Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. They involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.\nVarious commitments to extend credit are made in the normal course of banking business. Letters of credit are also issued for the benefit of customers. These commitments are subject to loan underwriting standards and geographic boundaries consistent with the Company's loans outstanding.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nLoan commitments outstanding and lines and letters of credit at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded loan commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,176,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,228,689\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,283\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,162\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,332,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,402,134\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnfunded loan commitments of $50 million as of December 31, 2019 were related to interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans and were of a short-term nature.\nThe Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary list of loan commitments at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nLoan commitments represent agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract and which have been accepted in writing by the borrower. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral obtained varies, and may include certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential and commercial real estate.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company which guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral held varies as specified above and is required in instances which the Company deems necessary. At December 31, 2019, approximately 82% of the dollar amount of standby letters of credit was collateralized.\nThe Company enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate residential mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. The Bank either locks in the loan and rate with an investor and commits to deliver the loan if settlement occurs under best efforts or commits to deliver the locked loan in a binding mandatory delivery program with an investor. Certain loans under rate lock commitments are covered under forward sales contracts of mortgage backed securities. Forward sales contracts of mortgage backed securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest income. Interest rate lock commitments and commitments to deliver loans to investors are considered derivatives. The market value of interest rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts are not readily ascertainable with precision because they are not actively traded in stand-alone markets. The Company determines the fair value of rate lock commitments and delivery contracts by measuring the fair value of the underlying asset, which is impacted by current interest rates and taking into consideration the probability that the rate lock commitments will close or will be funded.\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap derivative financial instruments to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to certain variable rate deposits. Such instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in other comprehensive income (a Consolidated Balance Sheet component of shareholders' equity) and is reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (i.e. the period when cash flows are exchanged between counterparties). Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not highly effective in hedging the changes in the expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings. Please refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into credit risk participation agreements ( RPAs\u201d) with institutional counterparties, under which the Company assumes its pro-rata share of the credit exposure associated with a borrower's performance related to interest rate derivative contracts. The fair value of RPAs is calculated by determining the total expected asset or liability exposure of the derivatives to the borrowers and applying the borrowers' credit spread to that exposure. Total expected exposure incorporates both the current and potential future exposure of the derivatives, derived from using observable inputs, such as yield curves and volatilities. These derivatives are not designated as hedges, are not speculative, and have a notional value of $27.4 million as of December 31. 2019. The changes in fair value for these contracts are recognized directly in earnings. Please refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nDerivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate caps and swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings. Please refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nIn connection with deposit guarantees, the Bank collateralizes certain public funds using qualified investment securities.\nWith the exception of these off-balance sheet arrangements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, capital expenditures or capital resources, that is material to investors.\nLIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT\nLiquidity is a measure of the Company's and Bank's ability to meet loan demand and to satisfy depositor withdrawal requirements in an orderly manner. The Bank's primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash balances due from correspondent banks, excess reserves at the Federal Reserve, loan repayments, federal funds sold and other short-term investments, maturities and sales of investment securities, income from operations and new core deposits into the Bank. The Bank's investment portfolio of debt securities is held in an available-for-sale status which allows for flexibility, subject to holdings held as collateral for customer repurchase agreements and public funds, to generate cash from sales as needed to meet ongoing loan demand. These sources of liquidity are considered primary and are supplemented by the ability of the Company and Bank to borrow funds or issue brokered deposits, which are termed secondary sources of liquidity and which are substantial. Additionally, the Bank can purchase up to $172.5 million in federal funds on an unsecured basis from its correspondents, against which there were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2019 and can borrow unsecured funds under one-way CDARS and ICS brokered deposits in the amount of $1.34 billion, against which there was $82.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019. The Bank also has a commitment at December 31, 2019 from Promontory to place up\nto $700.0 million of brokered deposits from its IND program in amounts requested by the Bank, as compared to an actual balance of $533.1 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, the Bank was also eligible to make advances from the FHLB up to $1.54 billion based on collateral at the FHLB, of which there was $250 million outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The Bank may enter into repurchase agreements as well as obtain additional borrowing capabilities from the FHLB provided adequate collateral exists to secure these lending relationships. The Bank also has a back-up borrowing facility through the Discount Window at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond ( Federal Reserve Bank\u201d). This facility, which amounts to approximately $653.0 million, is collateralized with specific loan assets identified to the Federal Reserve Bank. It is anticipated that, except for periodic testing, this facility would be utilized for contingency funding only.\nThe loss of deposits, through disintermediation, is one of the greater risks to liquidity. Disintermediation occurs most commonly when rates rise and depositors withdraw deposits seeking higher rates in alternative savings and investment sources than the Bank may offer. The Bank was founded under a philosophy of relationship banking and, therefore, believes that it has less of an exposure to disintermediation and resultant liquidity concerns than do many banks. The Bank makes competitive deposit interest rate comparisons weekly and feels its interest rate offerings are competitive. There is, however, a risk that some deposits would be lost if rates were to increase and the Bank elected not to remain competitive with its deposit rates. Under those conditions, the Bank believes that it is well positioned to use other sources of funds such as FHLB borrowings, brokered deposits, repurchase agreements and correspondent banks' lines of credit to offset a decline in deposits in the short run. Over the long-term, an adjustment in assets and change in business emphasis could compensate for a potential loss of deposits. The Bank also maintains a marketable investment portfolio to provide flexibility in the event of significant liquidity needs. The ALCO has adopted policy guidelines, which emphasize the importance of core deposits, adequate asset liquidity and a contingency funding plan.\nAt December 31, 2019, under the Bank's liquidity formula, it had $4.48 billion of primary and secondary liquidity sources. The amount is deemed adequate to meet current and projected funding needs.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND ADEQUACY\nThe assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as asset quality and mix, liquidity, earnings performance, changing competitive conditions and economic forces, stress testing, regulatory measures and policy, as well as the overall level of growth and complexity of the balance sheet. The adequacy of the Company's current and future capital needs is monitored by management on an ongoing basis. Management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses.\nThe federal banking regulators have issued guidance for those institutions, which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Pursuant to the supervisory criteria contained in the guidance for identifying institutions with a potential commercial real estate concentration risk, institutions which have (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land acquisitions which represent 100% or more of an institution's total risk-based capital; or (2) total commercial real estate loans representing 300% or more of the institution's total risk-based capital and the institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. The Company, like many community banks, has a concentration in commercial real estate loans, and the Company has experienced significant growth in its commercial real estate portfolio in recent years. As of December 31, 2019, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans (including construction, land and land development loans) represent 347% of consolidated risk based capital; however, growth in that segment over the past 36 months at 46% does not exceed the 50% threshold laid out in the regulatory guidance. Construction, land and land development loans represent 118% of consolidated risk based capital. Management has extensive experience in commercial real estate lending, and has implemented and continues to maintain heightened risk management procedures, and strong underwriting criteria with respect to its commercial real estate portfolio.\nLoan monitoring practices include but are not limited to periodic stress testing analysis to evaluate changes to cash flows, owing to interest rate increases and declines in net operating income. Nevertheless, we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of our commercial real estate concentrations, which could require us to obtain additional capital, and may adversely affect shareholder returns. The Company has an extensive Capital Plan and Policy, which includes pro-forma projections including stress testing within which the Board of Directors has established internal policy limits for regulatory capital ratios that are in excess of well capitalized ratios (as defined in the section Regulation\u201d above).\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors and the regulators can lower classifications in certain cases. Failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements.\nThe prompt corrective action regulations provide five categories, including well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If a bank is only adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to, among other things, accept, renew or roll-over brokered deposits. If a bank is undercapitalized, capital distributions and growth and expansion are limited, and plans for capital restoration are required.\nAt December 31, 2019, the capital position of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank, continue to exceed regulatory requirements and guidelines. The primary indicators relied on by bank regulators in measuring the capital position are four ratios as follows: Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Total risk-based capital ratio, the Leverage ratio and the CET1 ratio. Tier 1 capital consists of common and qualifying preferred shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangibles. Total risk-based capital consists of Tier 1 capital, plus qualifying subordinated debt, and the qualifying portion of the allowance for credit losses, and for the Company to a limited extent, excess amounts of restricted core capital elements. Risk-based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk-weighted assets, which are prescribed by regulation. The measure of Tier 1 capital to average assets for the prior quarter is often referred to as the leverage ratio. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is the Tier 1 capital ratio but excluding preferred stock.\nThe Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have adopted the Basel III Rules to implement the Basel III capital guidelines for U.S. banks. The capital rules require a CET1 ratio) of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which when fully phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7.0%; a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%, or 8.5% with the fully phased in capital conservation buffer; a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% with the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer; and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The Basel III Rules also increased risk weights for certain assets and off-balance-sheet exposures. See the Regulation\u201d section for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements.\nThe Company's capital ratios were all well in excess of guidelines established by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bank's capital ratios were in excess of those required to be classified as a well capitalized\u201d institution under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Company's and Bank's capital ratios at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are shown in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe ability of the Company to continue to grow is dependent on its earnings and those of the Bank, the ability to obtain additional funds for contribution to the Bank's capital, through additional borrowings, through the sale of additional common stock or preferred stock, or through the issuance of additional qualifying capital instruments, such as subordinated debt. The capital levels required to be maintained by the Company and Bank may be impacted as a result of the Bank's concentrations in commercial real estate loans. See further detail at the Regulation\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d sections.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods or services.\nNEW AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for New Authoritative Accounting Guidance and their expected impact on the Company's Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources of the Company. The Company's primary subsidiary is the Bank, and the Company's other direct and indirect active subsidiaries are Bethesda Leasing, LLC, Eagle Insurance Services, LLC, and Landroval Municipal Finance, Inc.\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this report.\nCaution About Forward Looking Statements.

The Company provides general commercial and consumer banking services through the Bank, its wholly owned banking subsidiary, a Maryland chartered bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Company was organized in October 1997, to be the holding company for the Bank. The Bank was organized in 1998 as an independent, community oriented, full service banking alternative to the super regional financial institutions, which dominate the Company's primary market area. The Company's philosophy is to provide superior, personalized service to its customers. The Company focuses on relationship banking, providing each customer with a number of services and becoming familiar with and addressing customer needs in a proactive, personalized fashion. The Bank currently has a total of twenty branch offices, including nine in Northern Virginia, six in Suburban Maryland, and five in Washington, D.C.\nThe Bank offers a broad range of commercial banking services to its business and professional clients as well as full service consumer banking services to individuals living and/or working primarily in the Bank's market area. The Bank emphasizes providing commercial banking services to sole proprietors, small and medium-sized businesses, non-profit organizations and associations, and investors living and working in and near the primary service area. These services include the usual deposit functions of commercial banks, including business and personal checking accounts, \"NOW\" accounts and money market and savings accounts, business, construction, and commercial loans, residential mortgages and consumer loans, and cash management services. The Bank is also active in the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans and the origination of SBA loans. The residential mortgage loans are originated for sale to third-party investors, generally large mortgage and banking companies, under best efforts and mandatory delivery commitments with the investors to purchase the loans subject to compliance with pre-established criteria. The Bank generally sells the guaranteed portion of the SBA loans in a transaction apart from the loan origination generating noninterest income from the gains on sale, as well as servicing income on the portion participated. The Company originates multifamily FHA loans through HUD's MAP. The Company securitizes these loans through the Ginnie Mae MBS I program, and sells the resulting securities in the open market to authorized dealers in the normal course of business and periodically bundles and sells the servicing rights. Bethesda Leasing, LLC, a subsidiary of the Bank, holds title to and manages other real estate owned (\"OREO\") assets. Eagle Insurance Services, LLC, a subsidiary of the Bank, offers access to insurance products and services through a referral program with a third party insurance broker. Additionally, the Bank offers investment advisory services through referral programs with third parties. Landroval Municipal Finance, Inc., a subsidiary of the Bank, focuses on lending to municipalities by buying debt on the public market as well as direct purchase issuance.\nAs 2019 began, expectations were high that the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, or FOMC, would continue moving short-term interest rates higher after they adjusted the Federal Funds Target rate up by 25 bps four times over the course of 2018. They also continued their plans for reducing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as U.S. Treasuries and mortgage backed securities mature and that cash flow was not reinvested. Actual GDP growth for 2019 in the U.S. was expected to be slightly below 2018 and after considerable negative market sentiment occurred, the FOMC reversed course and lowered short term rates three times in 2019. It also began increasing its balance sheet to support liquidity in the Federal Funds market. The 2019 U.S. official unemployment rate declined to 3.53% by year end. 2019 saw steady job growth, above average wage growth, an increase in the labor force participation rate, and improved consumer confidence levels. These fundamentals were factored into the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy, but the slowing growth and the lack of inflation led to the three 25 basis point rate cuts in the year. The Federal Reserve Board is currently indicating that this level of monetary policy is appropriate and any changes from here will be data dependent.\nLonger-term U.S. interest rates were much lower in 2019 than expected, with the ten year U.S. Treasury rate averaging 2.15% in 2019 as compared to 2.96% in 2018. The yield curve continued to flatten (two year as compared to ten year U.S. Treasury rates) during 2019 as the long end of the yield curve fell more sharply than the short end. The relative volatility of long-term interest rates was partly a function of attractive yields in U.S. Treasury securities relative to non U.S. bonds, as there remained some perceived weaknesses in European Central Bank economies generally, along with geopolitical risks, and expectations of slowing global growth. Energy prices (oil and natural gas), after a period of low prices in 2016, and a steady climb over the course of 2017 and early 2018 came back down\nbelow 2017 prices by the end of 2018. In 2019, energy prices remained relatively stable at 2018's average price. Inflationary factors remained close to, but still below, the FOMC's target rate of 2.00% throughout 2019.\nAs the ten year U.S. Treasury rate dropped back to 2016 levels in the summer of 2019, the volume of residential mortgage lending began to increase. Overall, real estate values in most of the Company's markets were stable to increasing in 2019 as interest rates remained historically low and job growth and personal income levels rose modestly. Political gridlock continued in Washington, D.C. over concerns of Presidential impeachment, immigration and health care policy, public debt and deficits, as well as tax policy and spending levels. Major corporate and personal tax reform was passed late in 2017, which benefited business earnings and consumer spending, while deficit spending continued and remains a point of serious concern.\nThe Company's primary market, the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, has continued to perform well relative to other parts of the country, due to good growth in the private sector along with increased government spending, and this was no different in 2019. Private sector growth was attributable in part to a diverse economy including a large healthcare component, substantial business services, and a highly educated work force.\nDuring 2019, the Company enhanced its marketplace positioning by remaining proactive in growing client relationships. The Company has had the financial resources to meet, and has remained committed to meeting, the credit needs of its community, resulting in continued growth in the Bank's loan portfolio during 2019. Furthermore, the Company's capital position remained strong in 2019 as a result of very strong and consistent earnings despite higher legal expenses. As a result of the Company's strong capital position and earnings, it was able to initiate a quarterly dividend and to implement a share repurchase program. The Company believes its strategy of remaining growth-oriented, retaining talented staff and maintaining focus on seeking quality lending and deposit relationships has proven successful and is evidenced in its financial and performance ratios. Additionally, the Company believes such focus and strategy of relationship building has fostered future growth opportunities, as the Company's reputation in the marketplace has continued to grow. At December 31, 2019, the Company had total assets of approximately $8.99 billion, total loans of $7.55 billion, total deposits of $7.22 billion and twenty branches in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.\nOperating in the more competitive economic environment of 2019, the Bank was able to produce solid growth in loans. Additionally, the Bank was able to grow its net interest spread earnings, maintain an above average net interest margin in spite of margin compression, retain a strong position regarding asset quality, and generate continued favorable enhanced operating leverage due to its seasoned and professional staff.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies, including for the year ended December 31, 2019 those identified below, inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or a valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility.\nInvestment Securities\nThe fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for investment securities available-for-sale are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available. The Company's investment portfolio is categorized as available-for-sale with unrealized gains and losses net of income tax being a component of shareholders' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two principles of accounting: (a) ASC Topic 450, Contingencies,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and are estimable and (b) ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan. The loss, if any, can be determined by the difference between the loan balance and the value of collateral, the present value of expected future cash flows, or values observable in the secondary markets.\nThree components comprise our allowance for credit losses: a specific allowance, a formula allowance and a nonspecific or environmental factors allowance. Each component is determined based on estimates that can and do change when actual events occur.\nThe specific allowance allocates a reserve to identified impaired loans. Impaired loans are assigned specific reserves based on an impairment analysis. Under ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d a loan for which reserves are individually allocated may show deficiencies in the borrower's overall financial condition, payment record, support available from financial guarantors and for the fair market value of collateral. When a loan is identified as impaired, a specific reserve is established based on the Company's assessment of the loss that may be associated with the individual loan.\nThe formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on internally risk rated loans, exclusive of those identified as requiring specific reserves. The portfolio of unimpaired loans is stratified by loan type and risk assessment. Allowance factors relate to the type of loan and level of the internal risk rating, with loans exhibiting higher risk and loss experience receiving a higher allowance factor.\nThe environmental factors allowance is also used to estimate the loss associated with pools of non-classified loans. These non-classified loans are also stratified by loan type, and environmental allowance factors are assigned by management based upon a number of conditions, including delinquencies, loss history, changes in lending policy and procedures, changes in business and economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, management expertise, concentrations within the portfolio, quality of internal and external loan review systems, competition, and legal and regulatory requirements.\nThe allowance captures losses inherent in the loan portfolio, which have not yet been recognized. Allowance factors and the overall size of the allowance may change from period to period based upon management's assessment of the above described factors, the relative weights given to each factor, and portfolio composition.\nManagement has significant discretion in making the judgments inherent in the determination of the provision and allowance for credit losses, including in connection with the valuation of collateral, a borrower's prospects of repayment, and in establishing allowance factors on the formula and environmental components of the allowance. The establishment of allowance factors involves a continuing evaluation, based on management's ongoing assessment of the global factors discussed above and their impact on the portfolio. The allowance factors may change from period to period, resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount of the provision or allowance, based upon the same volume and classification of loans. Changes in allowance factors can have a direct impact on the amount of the provision, and a related after tax effect on net income. Errors in management's perception and assessment of the global factors and their impact on the portfolio could result in the allowance not being adequate to cover losses in the portfolio, and may result in additional provisions or charge-offs. Alternatively, errors in management's perception and assessment of the global factors and their impact on the portfolio could result in the allowance being in excess of amounts necessary to cover losses in the portfolio, and may result in lower provisions in the future. For additional information regarding the provision for credit losses, refer to the discussion under the caption Provision for Credit Losses\u201d below.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets and MSRs that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights. Intangible assets that have finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and subject to periodic impairment testing. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are amortized to expense using accelerated or straight-line methods over their respective estimated useful lives.\nGoodwill is subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level, which must be conducted at least annually. The Company performs impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired.\nThe Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the goodwill impairment test is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates reflecting the market rate of return, projected growth rates and determination and evaluation of appropriate market comparables. Based on the results of qualitative assessments of all reporting units, the Company concluded that no impairment existed at December 31, 2019. However, future events could cause the Company to conclude that goodwill or other intangibles have become impaired, which would result in recording an impairment loss. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes by recording deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws. If actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. The Company's accounting policy follows the prescribed authoritative guidance that a minimal probability threshold of a tax position must be met before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognized, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management's analysis of tax regulations and interpretations. Significant judgment may be involved in applying the applicable reporting and accounting requirements.\nManagement expects that the Company's adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates due to the requirement that any change in judgment or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which it occurs. Factors that could impact management's judgment include changes in income, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation,\u201d which requires the expense recognition for the fair value of share based compensation awards, such as stock options, restricted stock awards, and performance based shares. This standard allows management to establish modeling assumptions as to expected stock price volatility, option terms, forfeiture rates and dividend rates which directly impact estimated fair value. The accounting standard also allows for the use of alternative option pricing models which may impact fair value as determined. The Company's practice is to utilize reasonable and supportable assumptions.\nDerivatives\nFASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815\u201d), provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain the Company's objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company's net income was $142.9 million, a 6% decrease as compared to $152.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWhere appropriate, parenthetical references refer to operating earnings, which the Company believes are more relevant comparisons to current and historical period results of operations. Reconciliations of 2017 GAAP earnings to operating earnings are contained in the tables under Selected Financial Data\u201d.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net income was $4.18 per basic and diluted common share as compared to $4.44 per basic common share and $4.42 per diluted common share for 2018, a 6% decrease in basic and 5% decrease in diluted earnings per share for the full year of 2019 as compared to 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reported a return on average assets, or ROAA, of 1.61% as compared to 1.91% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The return on average common equity, or ROACE, for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 12.20%, as compared to 14.89% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The return on average tangible common equity, or ROATCE, for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 13.40%, as compared to 16.63% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's earnings are largely dependent on net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, which represented 92% and 93% of total revenue (defined as net interest income plus noninterest income) for the full year of 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe net interest margin, which measures the difference between interest income and interest expense (i.e., net interest income) as a percentage of average earning assets, decreased 33 basis points from 4.10% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 3.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average earning asset yields decreased by 9 basis points (5.09% to 5.00%) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by 34 basis points (to 1.95% from 1.61%). For 2019, in spite of competitive factors, the Company has been able to maintain its loan portfolio yields relatively close to 2018 levels (5.45% as compared to 5.54%) due to disciplined loan pricing practices.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the net interest spread decreased by 43 basis points (to 3.05% from 3.48%) as compared to 2018, due primarily to an increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased in 2019 largely as a result of interest rate increases by the FOMC in mid to late 2018 and increased competition for deposits within our market area, though funding costs started to moderate in the second half of 2019, as the market rate cuts passed through to the liability base. Overall, the Company believes its deposit mix and cost of funds remain favorable. The benefit of noninterest sources funding earning assets increased by 10 basis points to 72 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 62 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of a favorable mix of noninterest bearing deposits. The percentage of average noninterest deposits relative to average total deposits was 31% for the full year 2019 compared to 33% for the same period in 2018.\nThe combination of a 43 basis point decrease in the net interest spread and a 10 basis point increase in the value of noninterest sources resulted in the 33 basis point decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.\nThe Company believes it has effectively managed its net interest margin and net interest income during 2019 as market interest rates (on average) have remained quite low. This factor has been significant to overall earnings performance during the past year as net interest income represented 92% of the Company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe provision for credit losses was $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net charge-offs of $9.4 million during 2019 represented 0.13% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.5 million or 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, the allowance for credit losses represented 0.98% of loans outstanding, as compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. The allowance for credit losses represented 151% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to 430% at December 31, 2018.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $25.7 million from $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 14% increase.\nThe efficiency ratio, which measures the ratio of noninterest expense to total revenue, remained favorable at 39.99% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 37.31% for the same period in 2018. Total noninterest expenses totaled $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 10% increase. As a percentage of average assets, total noninterest expense was 1.58% for the year of 2019 as compared to 1.59% for the same period in 2018.\nThe ratio of common equity to total assets increased from 13.22% at December 31, 2018 to 13.25% at December 31, 2019 due to growth from retained earnings. As discussed under Capital Resources and Adequacy\u201d, the regulatory capital ratios of the Bank and Company remain above well capitalized levels.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets. Earning assets are composed primarily of loans, loans held for sale, investment securities, and interest bearing deposits with banks. The cost of funds represents interest expense on deposits, customer repurchase agreements and other borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB and subordinated notes. Noninterest bearing deposits and capital are other components representing funding sources. Changes in the volume and mix of assets and funding sources, along with the changes in yields earned and rates paid, determine changes in net interest income.\nNet interest income in 2019 was $324.0 million compared to $317.0 million in 2018 and $283.9 million in 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net interest income increased 2% over the same period for 2018. Average loans increased $694.8 million (10%) and average deposits increased by $787.1 million (12%). The net interest margin was 3.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 4.10% for the same period in 2018. The Company has been able to maintain its loan yields in 2019 relatively close to 2018 levels due to disciplined loan pricing practices, and has managed its funding costs while maintaining a favorable deposit mix; much of which has occurred from sales efforts to increase and deepen client relationships. In spite of margin compression, the Company believes its net interest margin remains favorable as compared to its peer banking companies.\nThe table below presents the average balances and rates of the major categories of the Company's assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Included in the table is a measurement of interest rate spread and margin. Interest rate spread is the difference (expressed as a percentage) between the interest rate earned on earning assets less the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities. While the interest rate spread provides a quick comparison of earnings rates as compared to cost of funds, management believes that the net interest margin provides a better measurement of performance. The net interest margin (as compared to the net interest spread) includes the effect of noninterest bearing sources in its calculation and is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nEagle Bancorp, Inc.\nConsolidated Average Balances, Interest Yields And Rates (Unaudited)\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n (1) Loans placed on nonaccrual status are included in average balances. Net loan fees and late charges included in interest income on loans totaled $17.8 million, $19.6 million, and $18.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. \n (2) Interest and fees on loans and investments exclude tax equivalent adjustments. \nRate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income\nThe rate/volume table below presents the composition of the change in net interest income for the periods indicated, as allocated between the change in net interest income due to changes in the volume of average earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and the changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates. As the table shows, the increase in net interest income in both 2019 as compared to 2018, and 2018 as compared to 2017 was a function of an increase in the volume of earning assets.\n\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses represents the amount of expense charged to current earnings to fund the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is based on many factors which reflect management's assessment of the risk in the loan portfolio. Those factors include historical losses, economic conditions and trends, the value and adequacy of collateral, volume and mix of the portfolio, performance of the portfolio, and internal loan processes of the Company and Bank.\nManagement has developed a comprehensive analytical process to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The process and guidelines were developed utilizing, among other factors, the guidance from federal banking regulatory agencies. The results of this process, in combination with conclusions of the Bank's outside loan review consultant, support management's assessment as to the adequacy of the allowance at the balance sheet date. Please refer to the discussion under the caption Critical Accounting Policies\u201d for an overview of the methodology management employs on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance and the provisions charged to expense. Also, refer to the table in the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section that reflects activity in the allowance for credit losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased $3.7 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018, reflecting $13.1 million in provision for credit losses and $9.4 million in net charge-offs during 2019. The provision for credit losses in 2019 compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The higher provisioning during 2019, as compared to 2018, is due to higher net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of $9.4 million during 2019 represented 0.13% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.5 million or 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2018. Net charge-offs during 2019 were attributable primarily to commercial real estate ($5.0 million) and commercial loans ($4.5 million).\nAt December 31, 2019 the allowance for credit losses represented 0.98% of loans outstanding, as compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. The allowance for credit losses represented 151% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to 430% at December 31, 2018.\nAs part of its comprehensive loan review process, the Bank's Board of Directors and Loan Committee or Credit Review Committee carefully evaluate loans which are past-due 30 days or more. The Committees make a thorough assessment of the conditions\nand circumstances surrounding each delinquent loan. The Bank's loan policy requires that loans be placed on nonaccrual if they are ninety days past-due, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, Credit Administration specifically analyzes the status of development and construction projects, sales activities and utilization of interest reserves in order to carefully and prudently assess potential increased levels of risk requiring additional reserves.\nThe maintenance of a high quality loan portfolio, with an adequate allowance for possible credit losses, will continue to be a primary management objective for the Company.\nNoninterest Income\nTotal noninterest income includes service charges on deposits, gain on sale of loans, gain on sale of investment securities, income from bank owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) and other income.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $25.7 million as compared to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 14% increase due to $2.7 million higher gains on sale of residential mortgage loans, $1.4 million higher gain on sale of investment securities, partially offset by $767 thousand lower service charges on deposits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, service charges on deposit accounts decreased $767 thousand to $6.2 million from $7.0 million for the same period in 2018, a decrease of 11%, due primarily to a lower volume of insufficient funds charges.\nGain on sale of loans consists of gains on the sale of SBA and residential mortgage loans. For the year ended December 31, 2019, gain on sale of loans increased from $6.0 million to $8.5 million, an increase of 42%, compared to the same period in 2018.\nThe Company originates residential mortgage loans and utilizes both mandatory delivery\u201d and best efforts\u201d forward loan sale commitments to sell those loans, servicing released. Sales of residential mortgage loans yielded gains of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $5.4 million in the same period in 2018, due to higher origination volume ($665.7 million for 2019 as compared to $415.8 million for 2018) and higher sales volume ($628.2 million for 2019 as compared to $421.6 million in 2018). Loans sold are subject to repurchase in circumstances where documentation is deficient or the underlying loan becomes delinquent or pays off within a specified period following loan funding and sale. The Bank considers these potential recourse provisions to be a minimal risk, but has established a reserve under generally accepted accounting principles for possible repurchases. There were no repurchases due to fraud by the borrower during the year ended December 31, 2019. The reserve amounted to $79 thousand at December 31, 2019 and is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bank does not originate sub-prime\u201d loans and has no exposure to this market segment.\nThe Company is an originator of SBA loans and its practice is to sell the guaranteed portion of those loans at a premium. Income from this source was $309 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $540 thousand for the same period in 2018. Activity in SBA loan sales to secondary markets can vary widely from year to year.\nOther income totaled $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $8.0 million for the same period in 2018, a decrease of 3%.\nNet investment gains amounted to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $97 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe FHA business unit generated income of $501 thousand on the origination, securitization, servicing and sale of FHA Multifamily-Backed GNMA securities for the full year 2019 compared to $357 thousand for the same period in 2018.\nServicing agreements relating to the Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities program require the Company to advance funds to make scheduled payments of principal, interest, taxes and insurance, if such payments have not been received from the borrowers. The Company will generally recover funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements under the FHA insurance and guarantee program. However, in the interim, the Company must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding. The Company must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans. In addition, if a defaulted loan is not cured, the mortgage loan would be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and the Company would not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no funds advanced outstanding under FHA mortgage loan servicing agreements. To the extent the mortgage loans underlying the Company's servicing portfolio experience delinquencies, the Company would be required to dedicate cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts.\nNoninterest Expense\nTotal noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, premises and equipment expenses, marketing and advertising, data processing, legal, accounting and professional fees, FDIC insurance premiums, and other expenses.\nTotal noninterest expenses totaled $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 10% increase. For 2019, the efficiency ratio was 39.99% as compared to 37.31% for the same period in 2018.\nSalaries and employee benefits were $79.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $67.7 million for the same period in 2018, an increase of 18%. Cost increases for salaries and benefits were due primarily to $8.2 million of nonrecurring charges related to acceleration of share based compensation expenses associated with the retirement of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the resignation of certain directors. In addition, $4.0 million of the increase resulted from additional staffing, merit increases, and incentives. At December 31, 2019, the Company's full time equivalent staff numbered 492, as compared to 470 at December 31, 2018.\nPremises and equipment expenses amounted to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $15.7 million for the same period in 2018, a decrease of 8%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $527 thousand of sublease revenue as compared to $501 thousand for the same period in 2018. The sublease revenue is accounted for as a reduction to premises and equipment expenses.\nMarketing and advertising expenses increased to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $4.6 million for the same period in 2018, an increase of 6%, due primarily to increased digital and print advertising spend.\nData processing expenses decreased from $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $9.4 million for 2019, a decrease of 3%, primarily due to ongoing contract renegotiations.\nLegal, accounting and professional fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $12.2 million from $9.7 million in 2018, a 25% increase. The increased expenses were primarily associated with legal fees and expenditures associated with ongoing governmental investigations and related subpoenas and document requests. The Company expects to continue to incur elevated levels of legal and professional fees and expenses in 2020 as it continues to cooperate with these investigations.\nFDIC insurance decreased $306 thousand to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 9% compared to 2018, due to one time premium credits in the second and third quarters of 2019 due to the deposit insurance fund exceeding regulatory levels partially offset by premiums on a larger deposit base.\nOther expenses increased to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $15.8 million for the same period in 2018, an increase of 1%. The major components of cost in this category include broker fees, franchise tax, core deposit intangible amortization, insurance expenses, and director compensation. Cost control remains a significant operating objective of the Company.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $53.8 million in 2019 compared to $51.9 million in 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 27.4% and 25.4%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for 2019 was due primarily to a decrease in federal tax credits, an increase in nondeductible expenses, and adjustments related to the completion of the 2018 tax returns.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nOverview\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 were $8.99 billion, a 7% increase as compared to $8.39 billion at December 31, 2018. Total loans (excluding loans held for sale) were $7.55 billion at December 31, 2019, an 8% increase as compared to $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018. Loans held for sale amounted to $56.7 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018, a 195% increase. The investment portfolio totaled $843.4 million at December 31, 2019, an 8% increase from $784.1 million at December 31, 2018.\nTotal borrowed funds (excluding customer repurchase agreements) were $467.7 million at December 31, 2019 and $217.3 million at December 31, 2018, a 115% increase due to the $250.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nTotal shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 increased 7%, to $1.19 billion from $1.11 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity from December 31, 2018 was primarily due to increased retained earnings. Growth in retained earnings has enhanced the Company's capital position well in excess of regulatory requirements for well capitalized status.\nThe total risk based capital ratio was 16.20% at December 31, 2019, as compared to 16.08% at December 31, 2018. In addition, the tangible common equity ratio was 12.22% at December 31, 2019, compared to 12.11% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of common equity to total assets was 13.25% at December 31, 2019 as compared to 13.22% at December 31, 2018.\nInvestment Securities Available-for-Sale and Short-Term Investments\nThe tables below and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information regarding the Company's investment securities categorized as available-for-sale\u201d, or AFS. The Company classifies all its investment securities as AFS. This classification requires that investment securities be recorded at their fair value with any difference between the fair value and amortized cost (the purchase price adjusted by any discount accretion or premium amortization) reported as a component of shareholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income), net of deferred income taxes. At December 31, 2019, the Company had a net unrealized gain in AFS securities of $4.2 million with a deferred tax liability of $757 thousand, as compared to a net unrealized loss in AFS securities of $9.5 million at December 31, 2018, with a deferred tax asset of $2.8 million.\nThe AFS portfolio is comprised of U.S. agency securities (13% of AFS securities) with an average duration of 2.9 years, seasoned mortgage backed securities that are 100% agency issued (72% of AFS securities) which have an average expected life of 5.5 years with contractual maturities of the underlying mortgages of up to thirty years, municipal bonds (8% of AFS securities) which have an average duration of 4.0 years, U.S. Treasuries (4% of AFS securities) which have an average duration of 0.3 years, corporate bonds (1% of AFS securities) which have an average duration of 5 years, and equity investments which comprise less than 1% of AFS securities. The equity investment consists of common stock of two community banking companies with an estimated fair value of $198 thousand. Ninety eight percent of the investment securities which are debt instruments are rated AAA or AA or have the implicit guarantee of the U.S. Treasury.\nAt December 31, 2019, the investment portfolio amounted to $843.4 million as compared to $784.1 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of 8%. The investment portfolio is managed to achieve goals related to liquidity, income, interest rate risk management and to provide collateral for customer repurchase agreements and other borrowing relationships.\nThe following table provides information regarding the composition of the Company's investment securities portfolio at the dates indicated. Amounts are reported at estimated fair value. The change in composition of the portfolio at December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 was due principally to ALCO decisions to buy longer-term municipal investments and increase holdings of U.S. agency securities to better position the Company for the current interest rate environment while maintaining portfolio cash flow and liquidity. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the investment portfolio balances increased as compared to balances at December 31, 2018, as the Bank's deposit growth outpaced loan growth.\n\nAt December 31, 2019, there were no issuers, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, whose securities owned by the Company had a book or fair value exceeding 10% of the Company's shareholders' equity.\nThe following table provides information, on an amortized cost basis, regarding the contractual maturity and weighted-average yield of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2019. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Yields on tax exempt securities have not been calculated on a tax equivalent basis.\n\nFederal funds sold amounted to $39.0 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $11.9 million at December 31, 2018. These funds represent excess daily liquidity which is invested on an unsecured basis with well capitalized banks, in amounts generally limited both in the aggregate and to any one bank.\nInterest bearing deposits with banks and other short-term investments amounted to $195.4 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $303.2 million at December 31, 2018. These short term investments represent liquid funds held at the Federal Reserve to meet future loan demand, to fund future increases in investment securities and to meet other general liquidity needs of the Company. The Bank also holds a time deposit amounting to $1.6 million at December 31, 2019 and $1.6 million at December 31, 2018.\nLoan Portfolio\nIn its lending activities, the Company seeks to develop and expand relationships with clients whose businesses and individual banking needs will grow with the Bank. Superior customer service, local decision making, and accelerated turnaround time from application to closing have been significant factors in growing the loan portfolio, and meeting the lending needs in the markets served, while maintaining sound asset quality.\nLoan growth over the past year has been favorable, with loans outstanding reaching $7.55 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $554 million or 8% as compared to $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018. Loan growth over the last twelve months was due in part to the Bank's enhanced marketing efforts and continued focus on our Relationships FIRST strategy.\nLoan growth in 2019 was predominantly in the income producing - commercial real estate and owner occupied - commercial real estate loan categories. Despite an increased level of in-market competition for business, the Bank continued to experience strong organic loan production and portfolio growth. Notwithstanding increased supply of units, multi-family commercial real estate leasing in the Bank's market area has held up well, particularly for well-located close-in projects. While as a general comment there has been some softening in the Suburban Maryland office leasing market, in certain well located pockets and submarkets, the sector has evidenced some positive absorption. Overall, commercial real estate values have generally held up well with price escalation in prime pockets, but we continue to be cautious of the cap rates at which some assets are trading and we are being careful with valuations as a result. While the ultra high-end real estate market has softened, the moderately priced housing market has remained stable to increasing, with well-located, Metro accessible properties garnering a premium.\nOwner occupied commercial real estate and construction- C&I (owner occupied) loans represent 14% of the loan portfolio. The Bank has a large portion of its loan portfolio related to real estate, with 78% consisting of commercial real estate and real estate construction loans. When owner occupied commercial real estate and construction- C&I (owner occupied) are excluded, the percentage of total loans represented by commercial real estate decreases to 64%. Real estate also serves as collateral for loans made for other purposes, resulting in 85% of loans being secured or partially secured by real estate.\nThe following table shows the trends in the composition of the loan portfolio over the past five years.\n\nAs noted above, a significant portion of the loan portfolio consists of commercial, construction and commercial real estate loans, primarily made in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and secured by real estate or other collateral in that market. Although these loans are made to a diversified pool of unrelated borrowers across numerous businesses, adverse developments in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan real estate market could have an adverse impact on this portfolio of loans and the Company's income and financial position. While our basic market area is the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the Bank has made loans outside that market area where the nature and quality of such loans was consistent with the Bank's lending policies. At present, the Company believes that commercial real estate values are stable to improving in those sub-markets of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in which the Company has significant real estate exposure.\nThe federal banking regulators have issued guidance for those institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Pursuant to the supervisory criteria contained in the guidance for identifying institutions with a potential commercial real estate concentration risk, institutions which have (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land acquisitions which represent 100% or more of an institution's total risk-based capital; or (2) total commercial real estate loans representing 300% or more of the institution's total risk-based capital and the institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. The Company, like many community banks, has a concentration in commercial real estate loans, and the Company has experienced growth in its commercial real estate portfolio in recent years. As of December 31, 2019, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans (including construction, land and land development loans) represent 347% of consolidated risk based capital; however, growth in that segment over the past 36 months at 46% does not exceed the 50% threshold laid out in the regulatory guidance. Construction, land and land development loans represent 118% of consolidated risk based capital. Management has extensive experience in commercial real estate lending, and has implemented and continues to maintain heightened risk management procedures, and strong underwriting criteria with respect to its commercial real estate portfolio. Loan monitoring practices include but are not limited to periodic stress testing analysis to evaluate changes to cash flows, owing to interest rate increases and declines in net operating income. Nevertheless, we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of our commercial real estate concentrations, which could require us to obtain additional capital, and may adversely affect shareholder returns. The Company has an extensive Capital Plan and Policy, which includes pro-forma projections including stress testing within which the Board of Directors has established internal minimum targets for regulatory capital ratios that are in excess of well capitalized ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2019, loans to the Accommodation and Food Service industry represent 9% of the loan portfolio compared to 11% as of December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no other concentrations of loans in any one industry exceeding 10% of its total loan portfolio. An industry for this purpose is defined as a group of businesses that are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.\nCertain directors and executive officers have had loan transactions with the Company. Such loans were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with outsiders. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail regarding related party loans.\nLoan Maturity\nThe following table sets forth the time to contractual maturity of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019.\n\nLoans are shown in the period based on final contractual maturity. Demand loans, having no contractual maturity, and overdrafts, are reported as due in one year or less.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses represents the amount of expense charged to current earnings to fund the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is based on many factors which reflect management's assessment of the risk in the loan portfolio. Those factors include economic conditions and trends, the value and adequacy of collateral, volume and mix of the portfolio, performance of the portfolio, and internal loan processes of the Company and Bank.\nManagement has developed a comprehensive analytical process to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. This process and guidelines were developed utilizing, among other factors, the guidance from federal banking regulatory agencies. The results of this process, in combination with conclusions of the Bank's outside consultants' review of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, support management's assessment as to the adequacy of the allowance at December 31, 2019. During 2019, a provision for credit losses was made in the amount of $13.1 million and net charge-offs amounted to $9.4 million. A full discussion of the accounting for allowance for credit losses is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and activity in the allowance for credit losses is contained in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, please refer to the discussion under the caption Critical Accounting Policies\u201d within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for further discussion of the methodology which management employs to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses, as well as the discussion under the caption Provision for Credit Losses.\u201d\nThe allowance for credit losses represented 0.98% of total loans at December 31, 2019 as compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the allowance represented 151% of nonperforming loans as compared to 430% at December 31, 2018. The decline in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was due to a higher percentage increase in loans outstanding as compared to the allowance growth. The decrease in the allowance coverage ratio was due to a higher percentage increase in nonperforming loans as compared to the allowance growth. The majority of nonperforming loans are believed to be adequately secured by real estate. Please refer to the Nonperforming Assets\u201d section for a discussion of non performing loans.\nAs part of its comprehensive loan review process, the Bank's Board of Directors, Directors' Loan Committee and Credit Review Committee carefully evaluate loans which are past due 30 days or more. The Committees make a thorough assessment of the conditions and circumstances surrounding delinquent and potential problem loans. The Bank's loan policy requires that loans be placed on nonaccrual if they are 90 days past due, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, Credit Administration specifically analyzes the status of development and construction projects, including sales activities and utilization of interest reserves in order to carefully and prudently assess potential increased levels of risk which may require additional reserves.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had $48.7 million of loans classified as nonperforming, and $20.0 million of additional loans considered potential problem loans, as compared to $16.3 million of nonperforming loans and $102.7 million of potential problem loans at December 31, 2018. The $20.0 million in potential problem loans at December 31, 2019, decreased from $102.7 million at December 31, 2018 due primarily to two commercial real estate secured relationships. Please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Loans\u201d for a discussion of the Company's policy regarding impairment of loans. Please refer to the Nonperforming Assets\u201d section for a discussion of problem and potential problem assets.\nAs the loan portfolio and allowance for credit losses review processes continue to evolve, and with the adoption of CECL, there may be changes to elements of the allowance and this may have an effect on the overall level of the allowance maintained. Historically, the Bank has enjoyed a high quality loan portfolio with relatively low levels of net charge-offs and low delinquency rates. In 2019, the Company experienced an increased level of net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans compared to 2018 (0.13% as compared to 0.05%). The maintenance of a high quality portfolio will continue to be a high priority for both management and the Board of Directors.\nBank management, being aware of the loan growth experienced by the Bank, is intent on maintaining strong portfolio management and a strong risk rating process. The Bank provides analysis of credit requests and the management of problem credits. The Bank has developed and implemented analytical procedures for evaluating credit requests, has refined the Company's risk rating system, and has adopted enhanced monitoring of the loan portfolio (in particular the construction loan portfolio) and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, including stress test analyses. Additionally, fair value assessments of loans acquired is made as part of analytical procedures. The loan portfolio analysis process is ongoing and proactive in order to maintain a portfolio of quality credits and to quickly identify any weaknesses before they become more severe.\nThe following table sets forth activity in the allowance for credit losses for the past five years.\n\nThe following table presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan category and the percent of loans each category bears to total loans. The allocation of the allowance at December 31, 2019 includes specific reserves of $10.0 million against impaired loans of $54.9 million as compared to specific reserves of $11.4 million against impaired loans of $40.3 million at December 31, 2019. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses or charge-offs and does not restrict the usage of the allowance for any specific loan or category.\n\n (1) Represents the percent of loans in each category to total loans. \nNonperforming Assets\nAs shown in the table below, the Company's level of nonperforming assets, which is comprised of loans delinquent 90 days or more, nonaccrual loans, which includes the nonperforming portion of troubled debt restructurings, or TDR, and OREO, totaled $50.2 million at December 31, 2019, representing 0.56% of total assets, as compared to $17.7 million of nonperforming assets at December 31, 2018, representing 0.21% of total assets. The Company had no accruing loans 90 days or more past due at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018. Management remains attentive to early signs of deterioration in borrowers' financial conditions and to taking the appropriate action to mitigate risk. Furthermore, the Company is diligent in placing loans on nonaccrual status and believes, based on its loan portfolio risk analysis, that its allowance for credit losses at 0.98% of total loans at December 31, 2019, is adequate to absorb potential credit losses within the loan portfolio at that date. Total nonperforming loans amounted to $48.7 million at December 31, 2019, representing 0.65% of total loans, compared to $16.3 million at December 31, 2018, representing 0.23% of total loans. The majority of nonperforming loans are believed to be adequately secured by real estate.\nIncluded in nonperforming assets are loans that the Company considers to be impaired. Impaired loans are defined as those as to which we believe it is probable that we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, as well as those loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR that have not shown a period of performance as required under applicable accounting standards. Valuation allowances for those loans determined to be impaired are evaluated in accordance with ASC Topic 310- Receivables,\u201d and updated quarterly. For collateral dependent impaired loans, the carrying amount of the loan is determined by current appraised value less estimated costs to sell the underlying collateral, which may be adjusted downward under certain circumstances for actual events and/or changes in market conditions. For example, current average actual selling prices less average actual closing costs on an impaired multi-unit real estate project may indicate the need for an adjustment in the appraised valuation of the project, which in turn could increase the associated ASC Topic 310 specific reserve for the loan. Generally, all appraisals associated with impaired loans are updated on a not less than annual basis.\nLoans are considered to have been modified in a TDR when, due to a borrower's financial difficulties, the Company makes unilateral concessions to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Concessions could include interest rate reductions, principal or interest forgiveness, forbearance, and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Alternatively, management, from time-to-time and in the ordinary course of business, implements renewals, modifications, extensions, and/or changes in terms of loans to borrowers who have the ability to repay on reasonable market-based terms, as circumstances may warrant. Such modifications are not considered to be TDRs as the accommodation of a borrower's request does not rise to the level of a concession if the modified transaction is at market rates and terms and/or the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulty. For example: (1) adverse weather conditions may create a short term cash flow issue for an otherwise profitable retail business\nwhich suggests a temporary interest only period on an amortizing loan; (2) there may be delays in absorption on a real estate project which reasonably suggests extension of the loan maturity at market terms; or (3) there may be maturing loans to borrowers with demonstrated repayment ability who are not in a position at the time of maturity to obtain alternate long-term financing. The most common change in terms provided by the Company is an extension of an interest only term. The determination of whether a restructured loan is a TDR requires consideration of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the change in terms, and the exercise of prudent business judgment. The Company had nine TDRs at December 31, 2019, totaling approximately $19.1 million, as compared to twelve TDRs totaling approximately $24.6 million at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, seven of these TDR loans, totaling approximately $16.6 million, are performing under their modified terms, as compared to the same period in 2018, there were nine performing TDR loans totaling approximately $24.0 million. During 2019, there were three performing TDRs totaling $9.5 million that defaulted on their modified terms which were reclassified to nonperforming loans, as compared to the same period in 2018, there were two performing TDR loans totaling approximately $460 thousand that defaulted on their modified terms and were reclassified to nonperforming loans. A default is considered to have occurred once the TDR is past due 90 days or more, or it has been placed on nonaccrual. During 2019, there were three restructured loans totaling approximately $9.5 million, one loan totaling $4.8 million had its collateral property sold for approximately $3 million and the remaining $1.8 million was charged-off during the year, the second loan totaling $2.3 million defaulted on its modified terms and was charged off, the third loan totaling $2.4 million defaulted on its modified terms and migrated to nonperforming. During 2018, there were four defaulted loans totaling approximately $1.4 million that were charged off during the year. During 2019 there was one loan totaling $10.4 million that was re-underwritten into two new loans which provided better collateral for the Bank, and there was one restructured loan totaling approximately $309 thousand that was paid off from the sale proceeds of the collateral property, as compared to 2018, there were two loan payoffs on performing loans totaling approximately $3.9 million that were modified during the year. During 2018, there was a pay down of approximately $176 thousand on one nonperforming loan totaling approximately $183 thousand at December 31, 2017. Commercial and consumer loans modified in a TDR are closely monitored for delinquency as an early indicator of possible future default. If loans modified in a TDR subsequently default, the Company evaluates the loan for possible further impairment. The allowance may be increased, adjustments may be made in the allocation of the allowance, or partial charge-offs may be taken to further write-down the carrying value of the loan. During 2019, there was one loan modified in a TDR totaling approximately $2.3 million, as compared to the same period in 2018, there were two loans totaling approximately $12.8 million modified in a TDR. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.Included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019 is OREO of $1.5 million, consisting of three foreclosed property. Included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2018 was OREO of $1.4 million, consisting of one foreclosed property. OREO properties are carried at fair value less estimated costs to sell. It is the Company's policy to obtain third party appraisals prior to foreclosure, and to obtain updated third party appraisals on OREO properties generally not less frequently than annually. Generally, the Company would obtain updated appraisals or evaluations where it has reason to believe, based upon market indications (such as comparable sales, legitimate offers below carrying value, broker indications and similar factors), that the current appraisal does not accurately reflect current value. During 2019 and 2018, there were no OREO sales.\nThe following table shows the amounts and relevant ratios of nonperforming assets at the dates indicated:\n\n (1) At December 31, 2019, nonaccrual loans reported in the table above included two loans totaling approximately $2.5 million which migrated from performing troubled debt restructuring. \n (2) Gross interest income of $3.0 million and $1.0 million would have been recorded for 2019 and 2018, respectively, if nonaccrual loans shown above had been current and in accordance with their original terms, while interest actually recorded on such loans were $630 thousand and 265 thousand at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status. \nSignificant variation in the amount of nonperforming loans may occur from period to period because the amount of nonperforming loans depends largely on the condition of a relatively small number of individual credits and borrowers relative to the total loan portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2019, there were $20.0 million of performing loans considered potential problem loans, defined as loans that are not included in the 90 days past due, nonaccrual or restructured categories, but for which known information about possible credit problems causes management to be uncertain as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms which may in the future result in disclosure in the past due, nonaccrual or restructured loan categories. The $20.0 million in potential problem loans at December 31, 2019, decreased from $102.7 million at December 31, 2018 due primarily to two commercial real estate secured relationships. The balance of potential problem loans at December 31, 2019 included $11.9 million of loans that were considered potential problem loans at December 31, 2018. The Company has taken a conservative posture with respect to risk rating its loan portfolio. Based upon their status as potential problem loans, these loans receive heightened scrutiny and ongoing intensive risk management. Additionally, the Company's loan loss allowance methodology incorporates increased reserve factors for certain loans considered potential problem loans as compared to the general portfolio. See the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section for a description of the allowance methodology.\nOther Earning Assets\nResidential mortgage loans held for sale amounted to $56.7 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018. The Company's general practice is to originate and sell such loans only on a servicing released\u201d basis in order to enhance noninterest income. See the Business\u201d section for a description of the Bank's residential mortgage lending and sales activities.\nBOLI is utilized by the Company in accordance with income tax regulations as part of the Company's financing of its benefit programs. At December 31, 2019, this asset amounted to $75.7 million as compared to $73.4 million at December 31, 2018, which reflected the purchase of $580 thousand in additional policies during 2019 and an increase in cash surrender values. Refer to Note 19 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company recognizes a servicing asset for the computed value of servicing fees on the sales of multifamily FHA loans, the guaranteed portion of SBA loans, and other loans sold with retained servicing which is in excess of the normal servicing fees. Assumptions related to loan term and amortization are made to arrive at the initial recorded value, which is included in intangible assets, net, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor 2019, excess servicing fees of $175 thousand were recorded and $246 thousand was amortized as a reduction of actual service fees collected, which is a component of other income. At December 31, 2019, the balance of excess servicing fees was $507 thousand. For 2018, excess servicing fees of $1.8 million were recorded, $672 thousand of the FHA mortgage servicing was sold, and $1.1 million was amortized as a reduction of actual service fees collected, which is a component of other income. At December 31, 2017, the balance of excess servicing fees was $578 thousand.\nIn connection with the acquisitions of Fidelity in 2008 and Virginia Heritage in 2014, the Company allocated a portion of the purchase price to core deposit intangibles, based upon an independent evaluation, and which is included in intangible assets, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the initial and current carrying values as well as additions and amortization. The core deposit intangible is being amortized over its remaining economic life as a component of other noninterest expense.\nIn 2008, the Company recorded an unidentified intangible asset (goodwill) incident to the acquisition of Fidelity of $2.2 million. In 2014, the Company recorded an initial amount of unidentified intangible (goodwill) incident to the acquisition of Virginia Heritage\nof approximately $102 million. The Company's testing of potential goodwill impairment (which is performed annually), has resulted in no impairment being recorded.\nDeposits and Other Borrowings\nThe principal sources of funds for the Bank are core deposits, consisting of demand deposits, money market accounts, NOW accounts, and savings accounts. Additionally, the Bank obtains certificates of deposits from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The deposit base includes transaction accounts, time and savings accounts and accounts which customers use for cash management and which provide the Bank with a source of fee income and cross-marketing opportunities, as well as an attractive source of lower cost funds. To meet funding needs during periods of high loan demand and seasonal variations in core deposits, the Bank utilizes alternative funding sources such as secured borrowings from the FHLB, federal funds purchased lines of credit from correspondent banks and brokered deposits from regional and national brokerage firms and Promontory.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, total deposits increased by $250.1 million or 4% compared to the same period in 2018. Noninterest bearing deposits decreased $39.9 million or 2% to $2.06 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018, while interest bearing deposits increased by $290.0 million, or 6%. Within interest bearing deposits, money market and savings accounts collectively amounted to $3.01 billion at December 31, 2019, or 42% of total deposits, as compared to $2.95 billion, or 42% of total deposits, at December 31, 2018, an increase of $63.6 million, or 2%.\nAverage total deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $7.23 billion, as compared to $6.44 billion for the same period in 2018, a 12% increase.\nApproximately 18% of the Bank's deposits at December 31, 2019 ($1.28 billion) were time deposits, which are generally the most expensive form of deposit because of their fixed rate and term, as compared to 19% at December 31, 2018 ($1.33 billion).\nThe following table sets forth the maturities of time deposits with balances of $250 thousand or more, which represent 5% and 6% of total deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the maturities of time deposits and the Average Balances Table in the Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\u201d section for the average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. Time deposits of $250 thousand or more can be more volatile and more expensive than time deposits of less than $250 thousand. However, because the Bank focuses on relationship banking, and its marketplace demographics are favorable, its historical experience has been that large time deposits have not been more volatile or significantly more expensive than smaller denomination certificates.\n\nFrom time to time, when appropriate in order to fund strong loan demand, the Bank accepts brokered time deposits, generally in denominations of less than $250 thousand, from a regional brokerage firm, and other national brokerage networks, including Promontory. Additionally, the Bank participates in the CDARS and the ICS products, which provides for reciprocal ( two-way\u201d) transactions among banks facilitated by Promontory for the purpose of maximizing FDIC insurance. The total of reciprocal deposits at December 31, 2019 was $502.9 million (7% of total deposits) as compared to $391.7 million at December 31, 2018 (6% of total deposits). These sources are believed by the Company to represent a reliable and cost efficient alternative funding source for the Bank. The Bank also is able to obtain one way CDARS deposits and participates in Promontory's Insured Network Deposit, ( IND\u201d). The Bank had $533.1 million and $544.5 million of IND\u201d brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. However, to the extent that the condition or reputation of the Company or Bank deteriorates, or to the extent that there are significant changes in market interest rates which the Company and Bank do not elect to match, we may experience an outflow of brokered deposits. In that event we would be required to obtain alternate sources for funding.\nAt December 31, 2019, total deposits included $1.80 billion of brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way), which represented 25% of total deposits. At December 31, 2018, total brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way) were $1.36 billion, or 19% of total deposits.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had $2.06 billion in noninterest bearing demand deposits, representing 29% of total deposits. This compared to $2.10 billion of noninterest bearing demand deposits at December 31, 2018 or 30% of total deposits. The Bank also offers business NOW accounts and business savings accounts to accommodate those customers who may have excess short term cash to deploy in interest earning assets.\nAs an enhancement to the basic noninterest bearing demand deposit account, the Company offers a sweep account, or customer repurchase agreement,\u201d allowing qualifying businesses to earn interest on short-term excess funds, which are not suited for either a certificate of deposit or a money market account. The balances in these accounts were $31.0 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $30.4 million at December 31, 2018. Customer repurchase agreements are not deposits and are not insured by the FDIC, but are collateralized by U.S. agency securities and or U.S. agency backed mortgage backed securities. These accounts are particularly suitable to businesses with significant fluctuation in the levels of cash flows. Attorney and title company escrow accounts are examples of accounts which can benefit from this product, as are customers who may require collateral for deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limits but do not qualify for other pledging arrangements. This program requires the Company to maintain a sufficient investment securities level to accommodate the fluctuations in balances which may occur in these accounts.\nThe Company had no outstanding balances under its federal funds lines of credit provided by correspondent banks (which are unsecured) at December 31, 2019 and 2018. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $250.0 million of FHLB advances borrowed as part of the overall asset liability strategy and to support loan growth. The Company did not have FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Outstanding FHLB advances are secured by collateral consisting of a blanket lien on qualifying loans in the Bank's commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios.\nLong-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 include the Company's August 5, 2014 issuance of $70.0 million of subordinated notes, due September 1, 2024 and the Company's July 26, 2016 issuance of $150.0 million of subordinated notes, due August 1, 2026. For additional information on the Company's subordinated notes, please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Capital Resources and Adequacy\u201d section below.\nCOMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's net income was $152.3 million, a 52% increase as compared to the $100.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income per basic and diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $4.44 and $4.42, respectively as compared to $2.94 per basic common share and $2.92 per diluted common share for 2017, an increase of 51% per basic and diluted common share.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company reported a return on average assets, or ROAA, of 1.91% as compared to 1.41% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The return on average common equity, or ROACE, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 14.89%, as compared to 11.06% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The return on average tangible common equity for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 16.63%, as compared to 12.54% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's earnings are largely dependent on net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, which represented 93% and 91% of total revenue for the full year of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe net interest margin, which measures the difference between interest income and interest expense (i.e., net interest income) as a percentage of average earning assets, decreased 5 basis points from 4.15% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 4.10% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average earning asset yields increased by 36 basis points (4.73% to 5.09%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by 67 basis points (to 1.61% from 0.94%). For 2018, in spite of competitive factors, the Company has been able to increase its loan portfolio yields relative to 2017 levels (5.54% as compared to 5.17%) due to disciplined loan pricing practices.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the net interest spread decreased by 31 basis points (to 3.48% from 3.79%) as compared to 2017, due primarily to an increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased in 2018 largely as a result of interest rate increases by the FOMC and increased competition for deposits within our market area. Overall, the Company believes its deposit mix and cost of funds remain favorable. The benefit of noninterest sources funding earning assets increased by 26 basis points to 62 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 36 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of a favorable mix of noninterest bearing deposits. The percentage of average noninterest deposits relative to average total deposits increased to 33% for the full year 2018 from 32% for the same period in 2017.\nThe combination of a 31 basis point decrease in the net interest spread and a 26 basis point increase in the value of noninterest sources resulted in the 5 basis point decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.\nThe provision for credit losses was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs of $3.5 million during 2018 represented 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.3 million or 0.06% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2017.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to $22.6 million from $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 23% decrease.\nThe efficiency ratio, which measures the ratio of noninterest expense to total revenue, remained favorable at 37.31% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 37.84% for the same period in 2017. Total noninterest expenses totaled $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 7% increase. As a percentage of average assets, total noninterest expense was 1.59% for the year of 2018 as compared to 1.67% for the same period in 2017.\nThe ratio of common equity to total assets increased from 12.71% at December 31, 2017 to 13.22% at December 31, 2018 due to growth from earnings.\nNet interest income in 2018 was $317.0 million as compared to $283.9 million in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net interest income increased 12% over the same period for 2017. Average loans increased $698.2 million (12%) and average deposits increased by $656.9 million (11%). The net interest margin was 4.10% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 4.15% for the same period in 2017. The Company has been able to improve its loan yields in 2018 as compared to 2017 levels due to disciplined loan pricing practices, and has managed its funding costs while maintaining a favorable deposit mix; much of which has occurred from sales efforts to increase and deepen client relationships.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased $5.2 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017, reflecting $8.7 million in provision for credit losses and $3.5 million in net charge-offs during 2018. The provision for credit losses was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The lower provisioning during 2018, as compared to 2017, is due to lower loan growth ($579.9 million as compared to $733.6 million) due to higher loan payoffs. Net charge-offs of $3.5 million during 2018 represented 0.05% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $3.3 million or 0.06% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in 2017. Net charge-offs during 2018 were attributable primarily to commercial loans ($3.2 million).\nAt December 31, 2018 the allowance for credit losses represented 1.00% of loans outstanding, as compared to 1.01% at December 31, 2017. The allowance for credit losses represented 430% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2018, as compared to 489% at December 31, 2017.\nTotal noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $22.6 million as compared to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 23% decrease. This decrease was primarily due to $2.1 million lower revenue on the origination, securitization, servicing, and sale of FHA Multifamily-Backed GNMA securities, a $1.2 million nonrecurring adjustment to a tax credit investment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, a $354 thousand prepayment penalty associated with a single credit that was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017, $269 thousand of premium and servicing income recorded during 2017 resulting from the portfolio sale of $44.3 million in residential mortgages and HELOC's out of the loan portfolio, $3.3 million lower gains on sale of loans, and $445 thousand lower gain on sale of investment securities. The FHA business unit generated income of $357 thousand on the origination, securitization, servicing and sale of FHA Multifamily-Backed GNMA securities for the full year 2018 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2017. The residential mortgage unit had $5.4 million of gains on the sale of loans for the full year of 2018 as compared to $7.8 million for the same period in 2017 resulting from fewer loan originations and subsequent loan sales.\nTotal noninterest expenses totaled $126.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 7% increase. Salaries and employee benefits were $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $67.1 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of less than 1%. Cost increases for salaries and benefits were due to new hires and merit increases, higher stock-based compensation expense, and higher health insurance costs partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals. At December 31, 2018, the Company's full time equivalent staff numbered 470, as compared to 466 at December 31, 2017.\nPremises and equipment expenses amounted to $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $15.6 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of less than 1%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized $501 thousand of sublease revenue as compared to $455 thousand for the same period in 2017. The sublease revenue is accounted for as a reduction to premises and equipment expenses.\nMarketing and advertising increased from $4.1 million to $4.6 million, an increase of 12%, due primarily to increase digital and print advertising spend. Data processing increased from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $9.7 million for 2018, an increase of 18%, and due primarily to the costs of software and infrastructure investments.\nLegal, accounting and professional fees increased from $5.1 million to $9.7 million, an increase of 93% due primarily to due diligence costs from independent consultants associated with the internet event, related to the short seller claims, late in 2017 as well as costs to enhance risk management systems, including corporate governance as the Company approaches $10 billion in assets.\nFDIC insurance increased $958 thousand to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 38% compared to 2017, primarily due to higher assessment rates and growth in total assets.\nOther expenses decreased to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $15.9 million for the same period in 2017, a decrease of less than 1%. The major components of cost in this category include broker fees, Virginia franchise tax, core deposit intangible amortization, insurance expenses, and director compensation. Cost control remains a significant operating objective of the Company.\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $51.9 million in 2018 compared to $85.5 million in 2017 ($70.9 million on an operating basis), resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.4% and 46.0% (38.2% on an operating basis), respectively. The lower effective tax rate for 2018 was due to a $14.6 million deferred tax asset adjustment charged through tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, and tax credits taken in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting from new tax credit equity investments. While the Company's earnings beginning in 2018 benefitted from the lower corporate federal income tax statutory rates (from 35% to 21%) resulting from the 2017 Tax Act, companies were required to revalue their deferred tax positions as of December 31, 2017 based upon the reduced federal income tax rates. This adjustment increased income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 by $14.6 million ($0.43 per basic and $0.42 per diluted share). As a result of reduced income tax rates, the Company incurred substantially reduced income tax expense in 2018.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2018 were $8.39 billion, a 12% increase as compared to $7.48 billion at December 31, 2017. Total loans (excluding loans held for sale) were $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018, a 9% increase as compared to $6.41 billion at December 31, 2017. Loans held for sale amounted to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $25.1 million at December 31, 2017, a 23% decrease. The investment portfolio totaled $784.1 million at December 31, 2018, a 33% increase from $589.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nTotal borrowed funds (excluding customer repurchase agreements) were $217.3 million at December 31, 2018 and $541.9 million at December 31, 2017, a 60% decrease due to the $325.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2017 being paid off during 2018.\nTotal shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018 increased 17%, to $1.11 billion, from $950.4 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in shareholders' equity from December 31, 2017 was primarily due to increased retained earnings. Growth in retained earnings has enhanced the Company's capital position well in excess of regulatory requirements for well capitalized status. The total risk based capital ratio was 16.08% at December 31, 2018, as compared to 15.02% at December 31, 2017. In addition, the tangible common equity ratio was 12.11% at December 31, 2018, compared to 11.44% at December 31, 2017. The ratio of common equity to total assets was 13.22% at December 31, 2018 as compared to 12.71% at December 31, 2017.\nFederal funds sold amounted to $11.9 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $15.8 million at December 31, 2017. These funds represent excess daily liquidity which is invested on an unsecured basis with well capitalized banks, in amounts generally limited both in the aggregate and to any one bank.\nInterest bearing deposits with banks and other short-term investments amounted to $303.2 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $167.3 million at December 31, 2017. These short term investments represent liquid funds held at the Federal Reserve to meet future loan demand, to fund future increases in investment securities and to meet other general liquidity needs of the Company. The Bank also holds a time deposit amounting to $1.6 million.\nLoan growth over the past year has been favorable, with loans outstanding reaching $6.99 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $580 million or 9% as compared to $6.41 billion at December 31, 2017. Loan growth over the last twelve months was due in part to the Bank's enhanced marketing efforts and continued focus on our Relationships FIRST strategy.\nResidential mortgage loans held for sale amounted to $19.3 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $25.1 million at December 31, 2017.\nBOLI is utilized by the Company in accordance with income tax regulations as part of the Company's financing of its benefit programs. At December 31, 2018, this asset amounted to $73.4 million as compared to $60.9 million at December 31, 2017, which reflected the purchase of $10.0 million in additional policies during 2018 and an increase in cash surrender values.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, total deposits increased by $1.12 billion or 19% compared to the same period in 2017. Noninterest bearing deposits increased $121.3 million or 6% to $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.98 billion at December 31, 2017, while interest bearing deposits increased by $999.0 million, or 26%. Within interest bearing deposits, money market and savings accounts collectively amounted to $2.95 billion at December 31, 2018, or 42% of total deposits, as compared to $2.62 billion, or 45% of total deposits, at December 31, 2017, an increase of $328.4 million, or 13%.\nAt December 31, 2018, total deposits included $1.36 billion of brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way), which represented 19% of total deposits. At December 31, 2017, total brokered deposits (excluding the CDARS and ICS two-way) were $935.9 million, or 16% of total deposits.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had $2.10 billion in noninterest bearing demand deposits, representing 30% of total deposits. This compared to $1.98 billion of noninterest bearing demand deposits at December 31, 2017 or 34% of total deposits.\nThe Company had no outstanding balances under its federal funds lines of credit provided by correspondent banks (which are unsecured) at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company did not have FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2017 the Company had $325.0 million of FHLB advances borrowed as part of the overall asset liability strategy and to support loan growth. Outstanding FHLB advances are secured by collateral consisting of a blanket lien on qualifying loans in the Bank's commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios.\nLong-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 include the Company's August 5, 2014 issuance of $70.0 million of subordinated notes, due September 1, 2024 and the Company's July 26, 2016 issuance of $150.0 million of subordinated notes, due August 1, 2026.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments. Except for its loan commitments, as shown in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the following table shows details on these fixed and determinable obligations as of December 31, 2019 in the time period indicated.\n\n (1) Excludes accrued interest payable at December 31, 2019. \n (2) Borrowed funds include customer repurchase agreements, and other short-term and long-term borrowings. \n (3) The Bank has outstanding obligations under its current core data processing contract that expire in June 2024 and two other vendor arrangements that relate to network infrastructure and data center services, one expires in December 2021 and the other expires in December 2020. \n (4) The Bank has the option of terminating the George Mason agreement at the end of contract years 10 and 15 (that is, effective June 30, 2025 or June 30, 2030). Should the Bank elect to exercise its right to terminate the George Mason contract, contractual obligations would decrease $3.5 million and $3.6 million for the first option period (years 11-15) and the second option period (16-20), respectively. \n (5) Marketing sponsorship agreement with D.C. United. \n (6) Low Income Housing Tax Credits ( LIHTC\u201d) expected payments for unfunded affordable housing commitments. \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK\nThe Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. They involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.\nVarious commitments to extend credit are made in the normal course of banking business. Letters of credit are also issued for the benefit of customers. These commitments are subject to loan underwriting standards and geographic boundaries consistent with the Company's loans outstanding.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nLoan commitments outstanding and lines and letters of credit at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\n\nUnfunded loan commitments of $50 million as of December 31, 2019 were related to interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans and were of a short-term nature.\nThe Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary list of loan commitments at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nLoan commitments represent agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract and which have been accepted in writing by the borrower. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral obtained varies, and may include certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential and commercial real estate.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company which guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral held varies as specified above and is required in instances which the Company deems necessary. At December 31, 2019, approximately 82% of the dollar amount of standby letters of credit was collateralized.\nThe Company enters into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate residential mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. The Bank either locks in the loan and rate with an investor and commits to deliver the loan if settlement occurs under best efforts or commits to deliver the locked loan in a binding mandatory delivery program with an investor. Certain loans under rate lock commitments are covered under forward sales contracts of mortgage backed securities. Forward sales contracts of mortgage backed securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest income. Interest rate lock commitments and commitments to deliver loans to investors are considered derivatives. The market value of interest rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts are not readily ascertainable with precision because they are not actively traded in stand-alone markets. The Company determines the fair value of rate lock commitments and delivery contracts by measuring the fair value of the underlying asset, which is impacted by current interest rates and taking into consideration the probability that the rate lock commitments will close or will be funded.\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap derivative financial instruments to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to certain variable rate deposits. Such instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in other comprehensive income (a Consolidated Balance Sheet component of shareholders' equity) and is reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (i.e. the period when cash flows are exchanged between counterparties). Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not highly effective in hedging the changes in the expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings. Please refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into credit risk participation agreements ( RPAs\u201d) with institutional counterparties, under which the Company assumes its pro-rata share of the credit exposure associated with a borrower's performance related to interest rate derivative contracts. The fair value of RPAs is calculated by determining the total expected asset or liability exposure of the derivatives to the borrowers and applying the borrowers' credit spread to that exposure. Total expected exposure incorporates both the current and potential future exposure of the derivatives, derived from using observable inputs, such as yield curves and volatilities. These derivatives are not designated as hedges, are not speculative, and have a notional value of $27.4 million as of December 31. 2019. The changes in fair value for these contracts are recognized directly in earnings. Please refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nDerivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate caps and swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings. Please refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nIn connection with deposit guarantees, the Bank collateralizes certain public funds using qualified investment securities.\nWith the exception of these off-balance sheet arrangements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, capital expenditures or capital resources, that is material to investors.\nLIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT\nLiquidity is a measure of the Company's and Bank's ability to meet loan demand and to satisfy depositor withdrawal requirements in an orderly manner. The Bank's primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash balances due from correspondent banks, excess reserves at the Federal Reserve, loan repayments, federal funds sold and other short-term investments, maturities and sales of investment securities, income from operations and new core deposits into the Bank. The Bank's investment portfolio of debt securities is held in an available-for-sale status which allows for flexibility, subject to holdings held as collateral for customer repurchase agreements and public funds, to generate cash from sales as needed to meet ongoing loan demand. These sources of liquidity are considered primary and are supplemented by the ability of the Company and Bank to borrow funds or issue brokered deposits, which are termed secondary sources of liquidity and which are substantial. Additionally, the Bank can purchase up to $172.5 million in federal funds on an unsecured basis from its correspondents, against which there were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2019 and can borrow unsecured funds under one-way CDARS and ICS brokered deposits in the amount of $1.34 billion, against which there was $82.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019. The Bank also has a commitment at December 31, 2019 from Promontory to place up\nto $700.0 million of brokered deposits from its IND program in amounts requested by the Bank, as compared to an actual balance of $533.1 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, the Bank was also eligible to make advances from the FHLB up to $1.54 billion based on collateral at the FHLB, of which there was $250 million outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The Bank may enter into repurchase agreements as well as obtain additional borrowing capabilities from the FHLB provided adequate collateral exists to secure these lending relationships. The Bank also has a back-up borrowing facility through the Discount Window at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond ( Federal Reserve Bank\u201d). This facility, which amounts to approximately $653.0 million, is collateralized with specific loan assets identified to the Federal Reserve Bank. It is anticipated that, except for periodic testing, this facility would be utilized for contingency funding only.\nThe loss of deposits, through disintermediation, is one of the greater risks to liquidity. Disintermediation occurs most commonly when rates rise and depositors withdraw deposits seeking higher rates in alternative savings and investment sources than the Bank may offer. The Bank was founded under a philosophy of relationship banking and, therefore, believes that it has less of an exposure to disintermediation and resultant liquidity concerns than do many banks. The Bank makes competitive deposit interest rate comparisons weekly and feels its interest rate offerings are competitive. There is, however, a risk that some deposits would be lost if rates were to increase and the Bank elected not to remain competitive with its deposit rates. Under those conditions, the Bank believes that it is well positioned to use other sources of funds such as FHLB borrowings, brokered deposits, repurchase agreements and correspondent banks' lines of credit to offset a decline in deposits in the short run. Over the long-term, an adjustment in assets and change in business emphasis could compensate for a potential loss of deposits. The Bank also maintains a marketable investment portfolio to provide flexibility in the event of significant liquidity needs. The ALCO has adopted policy guidelines, which emphasize the importance of core deposits, adequate asset liquidity and a contingency funding plan.\nAt December 31, 2019, under the Bank's liquidity formula, it had $4.48 billion of primary and secondary liquidity sources. The amount is deemed adequate to meet current and projected funding needs.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND ADEQUACY\nThe assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as asset quality and mix, liquidity, earnings performance, changing competitive conditions and economic forces, stress testing, regulatory measures and policy, as well as the overall level of growth and complexity of the balance sheet. The adequacy of the Company's current and future capital needs is monitored by management on an ongoing basis. Management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses.\nThe federal banking regulators have issued guidance for those institutions, which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Pursuant to the supervisory criteria contained in the guidance for identifying institutions with a potential commercial real estate concentration risk, institutions which have (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land acquisitions which represent 100% or more of an institution's total risk-based capital; or (2) total commercial real estate loans representing 300% or more of the institution's total risk-based capital and the institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. The Company, like many community banks, has a concentration in commercial real estate loans, and the Company has experienced significant growth in its commercial real estate portfolio in recent years. As of December 31, 2019, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans (including construction, land and land development loans) represent 347% of consolidated risk based capital; however, growth in that segment over the past 36 months at 46% does not exceed the 50% threshold laid out in the regulatory guidance. Construction, land and land development loans represent 118% of consolidated risk based capital. Management has extensive experience in commercial real estate lending, and has implemented and continues to maintain heightened risk management procedures, and strong underwriting criteria with respect to its commercial real estate portfolio.\nLoan monitoring practices include but are not limited to periodic stress testing analysis to evaluate changes to cash flows, owing to interest rate increases and declines in net operating income. Nevertheless, we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of our commercial real estate concentrations, which could require us to obtain additional capital, and may adversely affect shareholder returns. The Company has an extensive Capital Plan and Policy, which includes pro-forma projections including stress testing within which the Board of Directors has established internal policy limits for regulatory capital ratios that are in excess of well capitalized ratios (as defined in the section Regulation\u201d above).\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors and the regulators can lower classifications in certain cases. Failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements.\nThe prompt corrective action regulations provide five categories, including well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If a bank is only adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to, among other things, accept, renew or roll-over brokered deposits. If a bank is undercapitalized, capital distributions and growth and expansion are limited, and plans for capital restoration are required.\nAt December 31, 2019, the capital position of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank, continue to exceed regulatory requirements and guidelines. The primary indicators relied on by bank regulators in measuring the capital position are four ratios as follows: Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Total risk-based capital ratio, the Leverage ratio and the CET1 ratio. Tier 1 capital consists of common and qualifying preferred shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangibles. Total risk-based capital consists of Tier 1 capital, plus qualifying subordinated debt, and the qualifying portion of the allowance for credit losses, and for the Company to a limited extent, excess amounts of restricted core capital elements. Risk-based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk-weighted assets, which are prescribed by regulation. The measure of Tier 1 capital to average assets for the prior quarter is often referred to as the leverage ratio. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is the Tier 1 capital ratio but excluding preferred stock.\nThe Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have adopted the Basel III Rules to implement the Basel III capital guidelines for U.S. banks. The capital rules require a CET1 ratio) of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which when fully phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7.0%; a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%, or 8.5% with the fully phased in capital conservation buffer; a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% with the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer; and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The Basel III Rules also increased risk weights for certain assets and off-balance-sheet exposures. See the Regulation\u201d section for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements.\nThe Company's capital ratios were all well in excess of guidelines established by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bank's capital ratios were in excess of those required to be classified as a well capitalized\u201d institution under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Company's and Bank's capital ratios at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are shown in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe ability of the Company to continue to grow is dependent on its earnings and those of the Bank, the ability to obtain additional funds for contribution to the Bank's capital, through additional borrowings, through the sale of additional common stock or preferred stock, or through the issuance of additional qualifying capital instruments, such as subordinated debt. The capital levels required to be maintained by the Company and Bank may be impacted as a result of the Bank's concentrations in commercial real estate loans. See further detail at the Regulation\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d sections.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods or services.\nNEW AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated

The primary subsidiary is the Bank, and others include Bethesda Leasing, LLC, Eagle Insurance Services, LLC, and Landroval Municipal Finance, Inc.\n\nThis section, which should be read along with the audited financial statements and notes, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements may predict future results or performance and are typically identified by terms like \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d and other similar expressions. The accuracy of these statements depends on future events and may differ materially from actual outcomes due to various factors. Some of these factors include general economic strength, geopolitical conditions, monetary and fiscal policies, regulatory changes, technological changes, cybersecurity issues, litigation and enforcement actions, and the ability to develop and launch new products successfully.\n\nIn assessing the Company's capital adequacy, various factors are considered such as asset mix, earnings performance, and regulatory capital ratios. The Company and the Bank have maintained capital ratios in excess of regulatory well-capitalized standards.\n\nRevenue for the Company primarily depends on net interest income. For 2019, the net income was $142.9 million, down by 6% from $152.3 million in 2018. The decline in net income includes increased legal and professional fees related to ongoing government investigations. Net interest margin decreased to 3.77% in 2019 from 4.10% in 2018. The decrease was attributed to competitive factors and managed funding costs amidst a favorable deposit mix.\n\nFor the year 2019, the provision for credit losses was $13.1 million compared to $8.7 million in 2018, with higher net charge-offs contributing to the increase. The allowance for credit losses represented 0.98% of outstanding loans at the end of 2019.\n\nNoninterest income increased to $25.7 million in 2019 from $22.6 million in 2018, while noninterest expenses rose to $139.9 million from $126.7 million over the same period.\n\nTotal assets reached approximately $8.99 billion at the end of 2019, with total loans at $7.55 billion and deposits at $7.22 billion. The Company also held significant liquidity reserves and maintained well-capitalized status with a strong capital position.\n\nThe Company's financial statements do not account for the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Instead, the impact of changing prices is primarily influenced by interest rates more than general inflation.\n\nFinally, new accounting guidance has been issued, but the discussion does not specify its impact on the Company's financial statements; further details can be found in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements."}
