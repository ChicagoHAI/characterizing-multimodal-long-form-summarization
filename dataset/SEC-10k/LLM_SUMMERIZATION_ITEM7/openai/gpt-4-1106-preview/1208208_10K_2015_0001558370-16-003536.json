Our imagery solutions support a wide variety of users in defense and intelligence, civil agencies, mapping and analysis, environmental monitoring, oil and gas exploration, infrastructure management, Internet portals, and navigation technology. Each day users depend on us to better understand our changing planet in order to save lives, resources and time.\nOur principal customers include U.S. and foreign governments, LBS providers, and those in energy and other industry verticals. The imagery that forms the foundation of our products, services and analysis is collected daily from our constellation of high-resolution imaging satellites and maintained in our ImageLibrary. We believe that our ImageLibrary is the largest, most up-to-date and comprehensive archive of high-resolution Earth imagery commercially available, containing more than 6.4 billion square kilometers of imagery, an area the equivalent of 43 times the landmass of the Earth, accumulated since 1999. As of December 31, 2015, our collection capacity capability was approximately 1.37 billion square kilometers of imagery per year, or the equivalent of roughly 9 times the Earth's land surface area, and offers intraday revisit around the globe.\n2015 Highlights\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn October 2015, the Company's Board of Directors increased authorized share repurchases of the Company's outstanding common stock to $335.0 million through December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we have repurchased a total of 8,962,786 shares at an average purchase price of $24.50 per share, for a total of $219.6 million under the program. Refer to Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d in Item 5 of this Form 10-K for further detail.\nRe-engineering and Restructuring Plans\nIn February 2015, the Company initiated a re-engineering and restructuring plan intended to improve our operational efficiency. The Company expects to incur approximately $12.0 million of the originally anticipated $15.0 million as a result of these efforts, which include restructuring charges to reduce global headcount and rationalize our real estate footprint, and other re-engineering charges to realize efficiencies from reducing headcount, such as re-engineering processes and enhancing system workflows, as well as costs related to the decision to proactively decommission IKONOS. The decrease in expected spend results primarily from lower than anticipated lease termination fees associated with the consolidation of our real estate footprint. We expect to complete this plan and realize the benefits resulting from our efforts by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nIn October 2015, the Company initiated a separate re-engineering and restructuring plan, in which the Company may incur up to an additional $18.0 million in an effort to further reduce global headcount, rationalize its real estate footprint, realize efficiencies from re-engineering processes and enhancing system workflows, and undertake other efficiency initiatives. We expect to complete this plan and realize the benefits resulting from our efforts by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe benefits realized from these plans may be partially offset by higher operating costs associated with growth in our business. The following table summarizes costs incurred and those that we expect to incur under each plan as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFebruary 2015 Plan\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nOctober 2015 Plan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nExpected\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nExpected\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncurred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRemaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncurred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRemaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10.0 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther re-engineering charges\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n6.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n8.0 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18.0 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Satellite Developments\nWe continue to make certain necessary enhancements to our WorldView-4 satellite, and intend to launch the satellite in the third quarter of 2016 for additional capacity as a result of anticipated incremental growth opportunities. We continue to receive early contractual agreements and letters of intent for direct access capacity from international defense and intelligence customers. We anticipate that these pre-launch commitments will generate incremental revenue in 2017, when the satellite is expected to begin commercial operations.\nResults of Operations\nWe operate in a single segment in which we use common infrastructure and technology to collect, process and distribute imagery products and services to customers around the world.

the EnhancedView SLA, other revenue and value-added services, and amortization of pre-FOC payments related to the NextView agreement with the NGA. The NGA purchases our imagery products and services on behalf of various U.S. Government entities, including the military and other agencies. Other U.S. defense and intelligence customers, including contractors, purchase value-added services with our imagery. Our U.S. Government customers focus on image quality, including resolution, accuracy, spectral diversity, frequency of area revisit, coverage, and availability of certain amounts of our capacity, as they integrate our products and services into their operational planning. Revenue is generated largely from service level agreements, tasking orders and sales of imagery from our ImageLibrary, in addition to sales of geospatial analytic products and expert services that obtain insight from our imagery. We sell to the U.S. Government primarily through direct sales.\nU.S. Government revenue increased $52.3 million, or 13.2%, from 2014 to 2015. EnhancedView SLA revenue increased as a result of WorldView-3 becoming fully operational on October 1, 2014, which increased constellation capacity made available to the NGA. Other revenue and value-added services declined primarily due to a decrease in non-cash amortization of Global EGD deferred revenue. The decrease in the non-cash amortization of pre-FOC payments related to NextView resulted from the extension of the period over which these payments are amortized to reflect the fourth quarter of 2014 extension of the useful life of WorldView-1.\nU.S. Government revenue increased $37.2 million, or 10.4%, from 2013 to 2014.

DAP, international civil government, LBS, energy, other international defense and intelligence, and other industry verticals. We sell products and services to these customers throughout the world both directly and through resellers. We have DAP agreements in 10 countries, earning revenue from sales of DAP facilities and from service fees to access our satellite constellation. Other diversified commercial customers use our content for mapping, monitoring, analysis and planning activities.\nDiversified Commercial revenue decreased $4.5 million, or 1.7%, from 2014 to 2015. DAP revenue increased from additional image deliveries and access minutes to meet customer demands, primarily driven by multiple crises in the Middle East. Other diversified commercial decreased as a result of lower LBS revenue and the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on certain of our non-U.S. customers.\nDiversified Commercial revenue increased $4.7 million, or 1.8%, from 2013 to 2014. DAP revenue increased primarily due to the impact of activating additional direct access customers. Other diversified commercial decreased primarily due to lower revenue from customers in Russia of $14.5 million and a one-time data delivery in 2013 totaling $5.9 million, partially offset by growth within our energy vertical.\nExpenses\nCost of Revenue\nThe following table summarizes our cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLabor and labor-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n62.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n68.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n71.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(3.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFacilities, subcontracting and equipment costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n71.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n79.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(10.4) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsulting and professional fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(42.2) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther direct costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29.1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n160.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n175.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9.7) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(8.5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere is not a significant direct relationship between our cost of revenue and changes in our revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of personnel, as well as the costs of operating our satellites, retrieving information from the satellites and processing the data retrieved.\nCost of revenue decreased $15.5 million, or 9.7%, from 2014 to 2015. Labor and labor-related costs decreased primarily from lower headcount in connection with our restructuring efforts and a reduction in incentive compensation due to lower than expected revenue growth. Facilities, subcontracting and equipment costs decreased primarily as a result of our re-engineering and restructuring efforts and a net decrease in remote ground terminal service fees impacted by negotiation of lower contract rates, which were partially offset by an increase in fees following the launch and commissioning of WorldView-3. The decrease in other direct costs was impacted by aerial imagery, which is amortized on an accelerated basis and consists of costs associated with previously purchased aerial imagery.\nCost of revenue decreased $14.9 million, or 8.5%, from 2013 to 2014. Labor and labor-related costs decreased primarily as a result of our restructuring efforts, partially offset by an additional month of expenses for employees assumed in connection with the GeoEye acquisition totaling $3.2 million. Facilities, subcontracting and equipment costs decreased primarily due to the consolidation of ground terminals and related telecommunication contracts in connection with the GeoEye acquisition, partially offset by an additional month of expense associated with the remaining ground terminals acquired totaling $2.0 million. Consulting and professional fees decreased primarily due to reduced services needed to support the integration of GeoEye.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our selling, general and administrative expenses:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n*\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n*\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLabor and labor-related costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n116.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n128.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n120.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n6.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsulting and professional fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n63.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(29.8) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRent and facilities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(21.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComputer hardware and software\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n14.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n14.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n12.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n20.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSatellite insurance\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(21.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(3.7) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n207.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n221.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n257.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(13.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not meaningful\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $14.5 million, or 6.5%, from 2014 to 2015.

These restructuring activities primarily consisted of reducing redundant workforce, consolidating office and production facilities, consolidating certain ground terminals and systems, and other exit costs.\nInterest Expense, net\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(29.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7.1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(3.4) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n*\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n108.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur interest charges are primarily associated with borrowings used to finance construction of our satellites, which are capitalized as a cost of satellite construction.\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest of $30.5 million, increased $21.9 million from 2014 to 2015 primarily as a result of the capitalization of 51.0% of interest to capital projects in 2015 compared to 87.8% in 2014.

commitments, including those under the anticipated ten-year term of the EnhancedView SLA we entered into with the NGA in August 2010, amounts committed under DAP agreements, firm orders, minimum commitments under signed customer contracts, remaining pre-paid subscriptions, firm fixed price reimbursement, and funded and unfunded task orders from our customers. Our backlog also includes amounts of obligated funding on indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ( IDIQ\u201d) contracts for products and services that we believe we are qualified to provide.\nThe EnhancedView SLA is structured as a ten-year term, inclusive of nine annual renewal options that may be exercised by the NGA. In July 2015, the NGA exercised its renewal option for year six under the EnhancedView SLA through August 31, 2016. Although the NGA may terminate the contract at any time and is not obligated to exercise any of the remaining four renewal options, we include the full remaining term in backlog. While funding contains an inherent level of uncertainty, we believe it is the NGA's intention to exercise the remaining options, subject only to annual Congressional appropriation of funding and the federal budget process.\nOther revenue and value-added services primarily include the Global EGD program under the EnhancedView Contract and various other products and services provided to the NGA.\nThe amortization of pre-FOC payments related to our NextView agreement with the NGA is recognized over the expected useful life of WorldView-1. The recognition of this revenue has no effect on our ability to generate additional revenue from the usage of the satellite, and we do not consider it a reduction in our capacity to generate additional sales. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, the period of recognition was extended to reflect the extension of the useful life of WorldView-1 by 2.5 years, to the fourth quarter of 2020, and the remaining deferred revenue balance will be recognized over the longer remaining term on a prospective basis. This change reduced the recognition of NextView revenue by $10.4 million annually.\nAmounts committed under DAP agreements for the next twelve months increased primarily as a result of the timing of contract renewals. Other diversified commercial backlog decreased primarily due to the elimination of minimum commitments under certain customer contracts. As a result, year over year changes in backlog for the next twelve months are not necessarily indicative of revenue expected to be recognized in 2016. DAP commitments over the life of contracts increased primarily as a result of early contractual agreements on our WorldView-4 satellite and increased customer commitments on our WorldView-3 satellite.\nAlthough backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, terminations, amendments or cancellations may occur, which could result in a reduction in our total backlog. In addition, failure to receive task orders under IDIQ contracts could also result in a reduction in our total backlog. Any such terminations, amendments or cancellations of contractual commitments, or failure to receive task orders under IDIQ contracts may also negatively impact the timing of our realization of backlog.\nBalance Sheet Measures\nTotal assets of $2,925.1 million decreased $146.1 million, or 4.8%, from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a $94.5 million decrease in property, plant and equipment, net, as a result of current year depreciation expense, partially offset by costs incurred related to WorldView-4, leasehold improvements associated with our new headquarters and various other infrastructure projects, in addition to a $42.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, net, primarily due to a one-time additional payment received from the NGA totaling $25.0 million based upon contract terms, and improved customer collections. These decreases were partially offset by an $8.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily from the step-up of EnhancedView SLA payments and improved customer collections, partially offset by cash used in connection with our share repurchase program.\nTotal liabilities of $1,677.0 million decreased $40.7 million, or 2.4%, from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a $61.8 million decrease in deferred revenue resulting from current year recognition of U.S. government revenue, partially offset by a $26.7 million increase in other liabilities primarily related to a tenant improvement allowance and capital lease obligation associated with our new headquarters.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $126.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company's cash equivalents primarily consist of U.S. Treasury and demand deposit money market accounts. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, as well as the cash we generate from our operations. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, we had $150.0 million available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur primary liquidity and capital requirements are for satellite construction and maintenance, working capital, our share repurchase program, and general corporate needs. We believe that the combination of funds currently available to us and funds expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to finance our operations and development activities for at least the next twelve months. If the U.S. Government, our largest customer, was not to renew or extend the EnhancedView SLA at similar levels or similar terms, we believe we would be able to maintain operations at a reduced level with existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity for at least the next twelve months. Furthermore, we believe we are adequately reserved for receivables denominated in U.S. dollars from foreign customers experiencing fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies.\nWe maintain a strong focus on liquidity, and do not anticipate significant changes to our existing capital structure. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our debt covenants, and expect compliance with our covenants to continue.\nIn summary, our cash flows were:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n23.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(68.3) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-cash items\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n331.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n278.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n249.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChanges in working capital\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(24.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(71.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(68.8) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n329.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n224.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n112.3 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(169.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(264.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(794.5) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(151.5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(71.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n665.1 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations is revenue generated by sales of satellite imagery products and services. We also generate cash through sales of geospatial analytic products and expert services to obtain insight from our imagery. The primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments for labor and labor-related costs, costs associated with operating our ground terminals, construction of DAP facilities, interest on our long-term debt, and other general corporate expenditures. Our sources and uses for cash flows from operations will likely remain consistent through 2016, though we expect our working capital needs to decrease in future periods through benefits realized from our restructuring plans. These benefits may, however, be partially offset by higher operating costs associated with growth in our business.\nCash provided by operating activities increased $104.8 million from 2014 to 2015, primarily due to increased net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, and a net increase in cash from changes in working capital, primarily driven by accounts receivable, accounts payable, and deferred revenue. Working capital was impacted by a one-time additional payment received from the NGA totaling $25.0 million based upon contract terms, and tenant improvement reimbursements totaling $20.3 million associated with our new headquarters.\nCash provided by operating activities increased $112.6 million from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, which was principally due to costs incurred in 2013 in connection with our acquisition of GeoEye.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment, including assets under construction, as well as business acquisitions. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2015 and those planned for 2016 are for satellite construction and maintenance costs. We expect to make capital expenditures on our WorldView-4 satellite until its completion and launch, which we anticipate to be in the third quarter of 2016. We will begin to replace the combined capacity of WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 in either 2017 or 2018, depending on capacity utilization, the projected lives of our in-orbit satellites at that time, and the needs of our customers. We anticipate an approximate four- year build cycle for a total cost not to exceed $600 million, excluding capitalized interest.\nCash used in investing activities decreased $94.7 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulting from placing our WorldView-3 satellite into service in October 2014, in addition to the acquisition of Spatial Energy, net of cash acquired, in the first quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we have incurred $163.4 million in capital expenditures, which includes capitalized interest of $32.1 million and a tenant improvement allowance of $20.3 million associated with our new headquarters.\nCash used in investing activities decreased $529.9 million from 2013 to 2014 principally due to the 2013 acquisition of GeoEye, net of cash acquired, totaling $524.0 million and a $53.1 million decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulting from placing our WorldView-3 satellite into service in October 2014. These decreases were partially offset by the 2014 acquisition of Spatial Energy, net of cash acquired, totaling $35.7 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities consists primarily of stock buybacks as part of our share repurchase program, principal payments made on our long-term debt, proceeds from stock option exercises and preferred stock dividend payments. We expect these cash usage trends to remain consistent in 2016, with stock buybacks continuing to be a significant expenditure. In October 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved an additional $130.0 million of authorized share repurchases of the Company's outstanding common stock through December 31, 2016, increasing the total authorized amount under the program to $335.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $115.6 million of shares may be purchased under the program.\nCash used in financing activities increased $79.9 million from 2014 to 2015 primarily as a result of our share repurchase program.\nCash provided by financing activities decreased $736.7 million from 2013 to 2014 principally due to the 2013 debt refinancing in connection with our acquisition of GeoEye and our share repurchase program initiated in 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Guaranty and Indemnification Obligations\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt obligations, including capital leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,407.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n128.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n611.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n602.6 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n146.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n11.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n24.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n23.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n86.6 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n245.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n71.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n118.6 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,799.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n148.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n183.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n661.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n807.8 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term debt obligations represent principal and interest payments to be made over the lives of our Term Loan and Senior Notes. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further detail. Capital lease obligations were primarily incurred in connection with our new headquarters. Our operating leases are primarily for office space in the United States. We generally believe leasing office space is more cost-effective than purchasing real estate for our existing operating locations. Other contractual obligations are remaining amounts due on long-term contracts primarily relating to the construction of our WorldView-4 satellite, including the launch vehicle, and operational commitments related to our remote ground terminals, in addition to our obligation to provide equity financing to the Vricon joint venture to the extent third-party financing is not obtained.\nGuaranty and Indemnification Obligations\nWe enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with resellers and others. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third-party claims alleging that one of our products infringes or misappropriates a patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against claims relating to property damage, personal injury or acts or omissions by us, our employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time we have made guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers. The majority of these agreements do not limit the maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n23.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(68.3) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n280.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n239.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n224.8 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37.5) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEBITDA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n342.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n272.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n122.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40.1 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther re-engineering charges\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIntegration costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29.2 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n20.6 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss from early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n17.8 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGain on disposition of subsidiary\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(1.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJoint venture losses\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n355.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n286.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n230.1 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and may not be defined similarly by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indications of financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operations as measures of liquidity. There are limitations to using non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies in different industries that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from ours.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are key measures used in our internal operating reports by management and our Board of Directors to evaluate the performance of our operations and are also used by analysts, investment banks and lenders for the same purpose. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure being used as a key element of the company-wide bonus incentive plan. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enables a more consistent measurement of period to period performance of our operations, and EBITDA facilitates comparison of our operating performance to companies in our industry.\nWe believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures are particularly important in a capital intensive industry such as ours, in which our current period depreciation is not a good indication of our current or future period capital expenditures. The cost to construct and launch a satellite and to build the related ground infrastructure may vary greatly from one satellite to another, depending on the satellite's size, type and capabilities. Current depreciation expense is not indicative of the revenue generating potential of the satellites.\nEBITDA excludes interest income, interest expense and income taxes because these items are associated with our capitalization and tax structures. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non-cash expenses reflect the impact of prior capital expenditure decisions, which are not indicative of future capital expenditure requirements. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA to exclude restructuring, other re-engineering, integration, acquisition costs, and loss from early extinguishment of debt, as these are non-core items.\nRestructuring charges incurred in 2013 and 2014 are costs incurred to realize efficiencies from the acquisition of GeoEye, such as reducing excess workforce, consolidating facilities and systems, and relocating ground terminals. Restructuring charges incurred in 2015 relate to our re-engineering and restructuring plans announced in 2015, pursuant to which the Company has and expects to continue to reduce global headcount and rationalize our real estate footprint. Other re-engineering charges are associated with the re-engineering and restructuring plans announced in 2015 and represent costs incurred to realize efficiencies from reducing headcount, such as re-engineering processes and enhancing system workflows, as well as costs related to the decision to proactively decommission IKONOS. Integration costs consist primarily of professional fees incurred to assist us with system and process improvements associated with integrating operations as part of the GeoEye acquisition. Acquisition costs are costs incurred to effect the GeoEye acquisition, such as advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other professional fees. Loss from early extinguishment of debt is related to the 2013 Credit Facility and Senior Notes, the proceeds of which were used to refinance our $500.0 million senior secured term loan and $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, and to fund the discharge and redemption of GeoEye's $525.0 million senior secured notes that we assumed in the acquisition. Additionally, it excludes the gain on subsidiary disposition and joint venture losses because these are non-core items that are not related to our primary operations.\nWe use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with traditional U.S. GAAP operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, and we do not place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures as our only measures of operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nReconciliation of Net Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n329.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n224.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n112.3 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash flows used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(169.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(264.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(794.5) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n524.0 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n159.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(158.2) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash flows provided by operating activities less net cash flows used in investing activities (excluding acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired). Free cash flow is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and may not be defined similarly by other companies. Free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to operating income (loss),\u201d net income (loss),\u201d net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\u201d or any other measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure - net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\u201d because it provides information about the amount of cash generated before acquisitions of businesses that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities. There are limitations to using non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies in different industries that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from ours.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe policies and estimates discussed in this section are considered critical because they had or could have a material impact on our financial statements, and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nApplication of U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the use of judgments and estimates. Specifically, judgment is used in interpreting complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions and determining when all criteria for revenue recognition have been met. In addition, the Company enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. Judgment is required to properly identify the units of accounting in transactions with multiple deliverables and to determine how revenue shall be allocated to those units of accounting. The Company has not historically been able to establish vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value or third-party evidence of selling price when allocating consideration as part of a multiple-element arrangement due to the unique nature of our products and services and lack of visibility into competitor pricing. Therefore, relative selling prices are determined on the basis of the best estimate of the selling price ( BESP\u201d). The Company's process for determining BESP involves judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary depending on the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to market conditions, competitive landscape, geographic or regional specific factors, internal costs, profit margin objectives and pricing practices used by the Company.\nSatellite Useful Lives\nThe estimated useful life over which we depreciate a satellite is determined once the satellite has been placed into orbit. The initial determination of the satellite useful life involves a complex calculation that considers random part failure probabilities, expected component degradation and cycle life, predicted fuel consumption, and other factors.\nAt least annually, or more frequently should facts and circumstances indicate, the Company performs an assessment of the remaining useful lives of its satellites. The assessment evaluates on-orbit performance, remaining fuel, remaining anticipated component cycle life and durability, environmental and operational stresses and other factors that may impact the satellite's useful life. Any change in the useful lives of satellites is accounted for on a prospective basis from the date of change, generally as of the first day of the quarter in which the change is made.\nAs a result of the Company's satellite life review in 2015, there were no changes to the estimated useful lives of our satellites for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of the Company's satellite life review in 2014, the Company extended the useful lives of each of WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 to 13 years. The useful life extensions resulted in non-cash reductions to depreciation expense prospectively from October 1, 2014. Certain cash payments received in connection with our NextView contract prior to WorldView-1 being placed into service were deferred and are being recognized to revenue over the life of WorldView-1. The useful life extension of WorldView-1 lengthened the period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized. Satellite useful lives are also used by the Company as a proxy for determining the estimated customer relationship period when evaluating the duration over which to amortize upfront fees in DAP contracts. In the event a DAP customer has access to multiple satellites under the same arrangement, the longest-lived satellite life is generally used. Therefore, any change in the estimated useful lives of our satellites would also impact upfront fee revenues and deferred contract costs on a prospective basis from the date of change. The extension of the life of WorldView-2 lengthened the period over which revenue is recognized on upfront fees and deferred contract costs are amortized.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in the business are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances warrant such a review. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to: a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used; a significant adverse change in the operations of the Company's satellites; a change in government spending or customer demand that could affect the value of the asset group; a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset group; or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset group.\nOur satellite constellation and related assets, including satellites under construction, are evaluated as a single asset group whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are identified, recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including the allocation of cash flows to assets or asset groups and, if required, an estimate of fair value for those assets or asset groups. There were no impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Factors that may result in an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to: a change in identified reporting units; an adverse change in business conditions; a prolonged decline in our stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value; a significant adverse change in government spending or customer demand; or impairment of long-lived assets.\nThe Company's market capitalization was below book value during the three months ended December 31, 2015, which generally coincided with the timing of our annual testing date. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative impairment test and determined that goodwill was not impaired. The Company determined fair value of its single reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis ( DCF\u201d), which requires the use of significant judgments and estimates. The significant estimates and assumptions included: a) the amount and timing of future cash flows, which is largely based on the Company's long range plan; b) working capital requirements; c) future capital expenditure requirements; d) estimation of a long-term growth rate; and e) the determination of an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate utilized in the DCF analysis is based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the weights of each component of capital structure and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment.\nBased upon the valuation performed, the fair value of the Company's single reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 35%. In order to further assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair value, we corroborated the valuation with market-based information such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in business acquisitions. Those analyses supported our fair value determination.\nThere was no goodwill impairment recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, or 2013.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition. Determining the fair value of an intangible asset may require the use of significant management estimates and assumptions, including expected future cash flows and discount rates. Management's estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\nIncome Taxes\nThe current provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed each year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The carrying value of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon the judgmental assessment of available evidence, it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable.\nThe Company utilizes a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes.\nThe recognition of a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position would result in a reduction to net income and could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial position in any given period.\nRecent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nDigitalGlobe is a leading global provider of high-resolution Earth-imagery products and services sourced from our own advanced satellite constellation and third-party providers. Our imagery solutions support a wide variety of users in defense and intelligence, civil agencies, mapping and analysis, environmental monitoring, oil and gas exploration, infrastructure management, Internet portals, and navigation technology. Each day users depend on us to better understand our changing planet in order to save lives, resources and time.\nOur principal customers include U.S. and foreign governments, LBS providers, and those in energy and other industry verticals. The imagery that forms the foundation of our products, services and analysis is collected daily from our constellation of high-resolution imaging satellites and maintained in our ImageLibrary. We believe that our ImageLibrary is the largest, most up-to-date and comprehensive archive of high-resolution Earth imagery commercially available, containing more than 6.4 billion square kilometers of imagery, an area the equivalent of 43 times the landmass of the Earth, accumulated since 1999. As of December 31, 2015, our collection capacity capability was approximately 1.37 billion square kilometers of imagery per year, or the equivalent of roughly 9 times the Earth's land surface area, and offers intraday revisit around the globe.\n2015 Highlights\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn October 2015, the Company's Board of Directors increased authorized share repurchases of the Company's outstanding common stock to $335.0 million through December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we have repurchased a total of 8,962,786 shares at an average purchase price of $24.50 per share, for a total of $219.6 million under the program. Refer to Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d in Item 5 of this Form 10-K for further detail.\nRe-engineering and Restructuring Plans\nIn February 2015, the Company initiated a re-engineering and restructuring plan intended to improve our operational efficiency. The Company expects to incur approximately $12.0 million of the originally anticipated $15.0 million as a result of these efforts, which include restructuring charges to reduce global headcount and rationalize our real estate footprint, and other re-engineering charges to realize efficiencies from reducing headcount, such as re-engineering processes and enhancing system workflows, as well as costs related to the decision to proactively decommission IKONOS. The decrease in expected spend results primarily from lower than anticipated lease termination fees associated with the consolidation of our real estate footprint. We expect to complete this plan and realize the benefits resulting from our efforts by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nIn October 2015, the Company initiated a separate re-engineering and restructuring plan, in which the Company may incur up to an additional $18.0 million in an effort to further reduce global headcount, rationalize its real estate footprint, realize efficiencies from re-engineering processes and enhancing system workflows, and undertake other efficiency initiatives. We expect to complete this plan and realize the benefits resulting from our efforts by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe benefits realized from these plans may be partially offset by higher operating costs associated with growth in our business. The following table summarizes costs incurred and those that we expect to incur under each plan as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFebruary 2015 Plan\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nOctober 2015 Plan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nExpected\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nExpected\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncurred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRemaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncurred\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRemaining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10.0 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther re-engineering charges\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n6.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n8.0 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18.0 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Satellite Developments\nWe continue to make certain necessary enhancements to our WorldView-4 satellite, and intend to launch the satellite in the third quarter of 2016 for additional capacity as a result of anticipated incremental growth opportunities.

the EnhancedView SLA, other revenue and value-added services, and amortization of pre-FOC payments related to the NextView agreement with the NGA. The NGA purchases our imagery products and services on behalf of various U.S. Government entities, including the military and other agencies. Other U.S. defense and intelligence customers, including contractors, purchase value-added services with our imagery. Our U.S. Government customers focus on image quality, including resolution, accuracy, spectral diversity, frequency of area revisit, coverage, and availability of certain amounts of our capacity, as they integrate our products and services into their operational planning. Revenue is generated largely from service level agreements, tasking orders and sales of imagery from our ImageLibrary, in addition to sales of geospatial analytic products and expert services that obtain insight from our imagery. We sell to the U.S. Government primarily through direct sales.\nU.S. Government revenue increased $52.3 million, or 13.2%, from 2014 to 2015. EnhancedView SLA revenue increased as a result of WorldView-3 becoming fully operational on October 1, 2014, which increased constellation capacity made available to the NGA. Other revenue and value-added services declined primarily due to a decrease in non-cash amortization of Global EGD deferred revenue. The decrease in the non-cash amortization of pre-FOC payments related to NextView resulted from the extension of the period over which these payments are amortized to reflect the fourth quarter of 2014 extension of the useful life of WorldView-1.\nU.S. Government revenue increased $37.2 million, or 10.4%, from 2013 to 2014.

DAP, international civil government, LBS, energy, other international defense and intelligence, and other industry verticals. We sell products and services to these customers throughout the world both directly and through resellers. We have DAP agreements in 10 countries, earning revenue from sales of DAP facilities and from service fees to access our satellite constellation. Other diversified commercial customers use our content for mapping, monitoring, analysis and planning activities.\nDiversified Commercial revenue decreased $4.5 million, or 1.7%, from 2014 to 2015. DAP revenue increased from additional image deliveries and access minutes to meet customer demands, primarily driven by multiple crises in the Middle East. Other diversified commercial decreased as a result of lower LBS revenue and the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on certain of our non-U.S. customers.\nDiversified Commercial revenue increased $4.7 million, or 1.8%, from 2013 to 2014. DAP revenue increased primarily due to the impact of activating additional direct access customers. Other diversified commercial decreased primarily due to lower revenue from customers in Russia of $14.5 million and a one-time data delivery in 2013 totaling $5.9 million, partially offset by growth within our energy vertical.\nExpenses\nCost of Revenue\nThe following table summarizes our cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLabor and labor-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n62.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n68.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n71.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(3.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFacilities, subcontracting and equipment costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n66.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n71.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n79.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(10.4) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsulting and professional fees\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(42.2) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther direct costs\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29.1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n160.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n175.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9.7) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(8.5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere is not a significant direct relationship between our cost of revenue and changes in our revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of personnel, as well as the costs of operating our satellites, retrieving information from the satellites and processing the data retrieved.\nCost of revenue decreased $15.5 million, or 9.7%, from 2014 to 2015. Labor and labor-related costs decreased primarily from lower headcount in connection with our restructuring efforts and a reduction in incentive compensation due to lower than expected revenue growth. Facilities, subcontracting and equipment costs decreased primarily as a result of our re-engineering and restructuring efforts and a net decrease in remote ground terminal service fees impacted by negotiation of lower contract rates, which were partially offset by an increase in fees following the launch and commissioning of WorldView-3. The decrease in other direct costs was impacted by aerial imagery, which is amortized on an accelerated basis and consists of costs associated with previously purchased aerial imagery.\nCost of revenue decreased $14.9 million, or 8.5%, from 2013 to 2014. Labor and labor-related costs decreased primarily as a result of our restructuring efforts, partially offset by an additional month of expenses for employees assumed in connection with the GeoEye acquisition totaling $3.2 million. Facilities, subcontracting and equipment costs decreased primarily due to the consolidation of ground terminals and related telecommunication contracts in connection with the GeoEye acquisition, partially offset by an additional month of expense associated with the remaining ground terminals acquired totaling $2.0 million.

The decrease in satellite insurance is primarily due to a reduction in rates to insure our in-orbit satellites, partially offset by WorldView-3 launch insurance expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n280.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n239.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n224.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n17.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n6.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization increased $41.0 million, or 17.1%, from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to higher depreciation expense of $42.4 million following the launch and commissioning of WorldView-3 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a $17.6 million increase in hardware and software expense primarily from assets placed into service in 2015, partially offset by a $21.4 million decrease in depreciation expense as a result of the fourth quarter of 2014 extension of the useful lives of our WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 satellites.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $14.9 million, or 6.6%, from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to higher depreciation expense of $14.1 million following the launch and commissioning of WorldView-3 and an additional month of expense for property, equipment and intangible assets assumed in the GeoEye acquisition totaling $7.1 million, partially offset by a $7.2 million decrease in expense as a result of the extension of the fourth quarter of 2014 extension of the useful lives of our WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 satellites.\nRestructuring Charges\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPercentage change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs.\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRestructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n*\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n*\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015, the Company initiated two restructuring plans intended to improve our operational efficiency. Under the restructuring plans, the Company has and expects to continue to reduce global headcount and rationalize its real estate footprint. Restructuring charges incurred in 2015 relate to these plans. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further detail.\nRestructuring charges in 2013 and 2014 were incurred in conjunction with our acquisition of GeoEye to optimize our operational efficiency by realigning our infrastructure with customer demand.

commitments, including those under the anticipated ten-year term of the EnhancedView SLA we entered into with the NGA in August 2010, amounts committed under DAP agreements, firm orders, minimum commitments under signed customer contracts, remaining pre-paid subscriptions, firm fixed price reimbursement, and funded and unfunded task orders from our customers. Our backlog also includes amounts of obligated funding on indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ( IDIQ\u201d) contracts for products and services that we believe we are qualified to provide.\nThe EnhancedView SLA is structured as a ten-year term, inclusive of nine annual renewal options that may be exercised by the NGA. In July 2015, the NGA exercised its renewal option for year six under the EnhancedView SLA through August 31, 2016. Although the NGA may terminate the contract at any time and is not obligated to exercise any of the remaining four renewal options, we include the full remaining term in backlog. While funding contains an inherent level of uncertainty, we believe it is the NGA's intention to exercise the remaining options, subject only to annual Congressional appropriation of funding and the federal budget process.\nOther revenue and value-added services primarily include the Global EGD program under the EnhancedView Contract and various other products and services provided to the NGA.\nThe amortization of pre-FOC payments related to our NextView agreement with the NGA is recognized over the expected useful life of WorldView-1. The recognition of this revenue has no effect on our ability to generate additional revenue from the usage of the satellite, and we do not consider it a reduction in our capacity to generate additional sales. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, the period of recognition was extended to reflect the extension of the useful life of WorldView-1 by 2.5 years, to the fourth quarter of 2020, and the remaining deferred revenue balance will be recognized over the longer remaining term on a prospective basis. This change reduced the recognition of NextView revenue by $10.4 million annually.\nAmounts committed under DAP agreements for the next twelve months increased primarily as a result of the timing of contract renewals. Other diversified commercial backlog decreased primarily due to the elimination of minimum commitments under certain customer contracts. As a result, year over year changes in backlog for the next twelve months are not necessarily indicative of revenue expected to be recognized in 2016. DAP commitments over the life of contracts increased primarily as a result of early contractual agreements on our WorldView-4 satellite and increased customer commitments on our WorldView-3 satellite.\nAlthough backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, terminations, amendments or cancellations may occur, which could result in a reduction in our total backlog. In addition, failure to receive task orders under IDIQ contracts could also result in a reduction in our total backlog. Any such terminations, amendments or cancellations of contractual commitments, or failure to receive task orders under IDIQ contracts may also negatively impact the timing of our realization of backlog.\nBalance Sheet Measures\nTotal assets of $2,925.1 million decreased $146.1 million, or 4.8%, from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a $94.5 million decrease in property, plant and equipment, net, as a result of current year depreciation expense, partially offset by costs incurred related to WorldView-4, leasehold improvements associated with our new headquarters and various other infrastructure projects, in addition to a $42.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, net, primarily due to a one-time additional payment received from the NGA totaling $25.0 million based upon contract terms, and improved customer collections. These decreases were partially offset by an $8.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily from the step-up of EnhancedView SLA payments and improved customer collections, partially offset by cash used in connection with our share repurchase program.\nTotal liabilities of $1,677.0 million decreased $40.7 million, or 2.4%, from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a $61.8 million decrease in deferred revenue resulting from current year recognition of U.S. government revenue, partially offset by a $26.7 million increase in other liabilities primarily related to a tenant improvement allowance and capital lease obligation associated with our new headquarters.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $126.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company's cash equivalents primarily consist of U.S. Treasury and demand deposit money market accounts. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, as well as the cash we generate from our operations. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, we had $150.0 million available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur primary liquidity and capital requirements are for satellite construction and maintenance, working capital, our share repurchase program, and general corporate needs. We believe that the combination of funds currently available to us and funds expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to finance our operations and development activities for at least the next twelve months. If the U.S. Government, our largest customer, was not to renew or extend the EnhancedView SLA at similar levels or similar terms, we believe we would be able to maintain operations at a reduced level with existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity for at least the next twelve months. Furthermore, we believe we are adequately reserved for receivables denominated in U.S. dollars from foreign customers experiencing fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies.\nWe maintain a strong focus on liquidity, and do not anticipate significant changes to our existing capital structure. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our debt covenants, and expect compliance with our covenants to continue.\nIn summary, our cash flows were:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n23.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(68.3) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-cash items\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n331.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n278.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n249.4 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChanges in working capital\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(24.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(71.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(68.8) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n329.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n224.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n112.3 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(169.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(264.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(794.5) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(151.5) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(71.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n665.1 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations is revenue generated by sales of satellite imagery products and services. We also generate cash through sales of geospatial analytic products and expert services to obtain insight from our imagery. The primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments for labor and labor-related costs, costs associated with operating our ground terminals, construction of DAP facilities, interest on our long-term debt, and other general corporate expenditures. Our sources and uses for cash flows from operations will likely remain consistent through 2016, though we expect our working capital needs to decrease in future periods through benefits realized from our restructuring plans. These benefits may, however, be partially offset by higher operating costs associated with growth in our business.\nCash provided by operating activities increased $104.8 million from 2014 to 2015, primarily due to increased net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, and a net increase in cash from changes in working capital, primarily driven by accounts receivable, accounts payable, and deferred revenue. Working capital was impacted by a one-time additional payment received from the NGA totaling $25.0 million based upon contract terms, and tenant improvement reimbursements totaling $20.3 million associated with our new headquarters.\nCash provided by operating activities increased $112.6 million from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, which was principally due to costs incurred in 2013 in connection with our acquisition of GeoEye.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment, including assets under construction, as well as business acquisitions. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2015 and those planned for 2016 are for satellite construction and maintenance costs. We expect to make capital expenditures on our WorldView-4 satellite until its completion and launch, which we anticipate to be in the third quarter of 2016. We will begin to replace the combined capacity of WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 in either 2017 or 2018, depending on capacity utilization, the projected lives of our in-orbit satellites at that time, and the needs of our customers. We anticipate an approximate four- year build cycle for a total cost not to exceed $600 million, excluding capitalized interest.\nCash used in investing activities decreased $94.7 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulting from placing our WorldView-3 satellite into service in October 2014, in addition to the acquisition of Spatial Energy, net of cash acquired, in the first quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we have incurred $163.4 million in capital expenditures, which includes capitalized interest of $32.1 million and a tenant improvement allowance of $20.3 million associated with our new headquarters.\nCash used in investing activities decreased $529.9 million from 2013 to 2014 principally due to the 2013 acquisition of GeoEye, net of cash acquired, totaling $524.0 million and a $53.1 million decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulting from placing our WorldView-3 satellite into service in October 2014. These decreases were partially offset by the 2014 acquisition of Spatial Energy, net of cash acquired, totaling $35.7 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities consists primarily of stock buybacks as part of our share repurchase program, principal payments made on our long-term debt, proceeds from stock option exercises and preferred stock dividend payments. We expect these cash usage trends to remain consistent in 2016, with stock buybacks continuing to be a significant expenditure. In October 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved an additional $130.0 million of authorized share repurchases of the Company's outstanding common stock through December 31, 2016, increasing the total authorized amount under the program to $335.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $115.6 million of shares may be purchased under the program.\nCash used in financing activities increased $79.9 million from 2014 to 2015 primarily as a result of our share repurchase program.\nCash provided by financing activities decreased $736.7 million from 2013 to 2014 principally due to the 2013 debt refinancing in connection with our acquisition of GeoEye and our share repurchase program initiated in 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Guaranty and Indemnification Obligations\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt obligations, including capital leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,407.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n128.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n611.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n602.6 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n146.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n11.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n24.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n23.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n86.6 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n245.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n71.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n118.6 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,799.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n148.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n183.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n661.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n807.8 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term debt obligations represent principal and interest payments to be made over the lives of our Term Loan and Senior Notes. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further detail. Capital lease obligations were primarily incurred in connection with our new headquarters. Our operating leases are primarily for office space in the United States. We generally believe leasing office space is more cost-effective than purchasing real estate for our existing operating locations. Other contractual obligations are remaining amounts due on long-term contracts primarily relating to the construction of our WorldView-4 satellite, including the launch vehicle, and operational commitments related to our remote ground terminals, in addition to our obligation to provide equity financing to the Vricon joint venture to the extent third-party financing is not obtained.\nGuaranty and Indemnification Obligations\nWe enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with resellers and others. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third-party claims alleging that one of our products infringes or misappropriates a patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against claims relating to property damage, personal injury or acts or omissions by us, our employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time we have made guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indications of financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operations as measures of liquidity. There are limitations to using non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies in different industries that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from ours.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are key measures used in our internal operating reports by management and our Board of Directors to evaluate the performance of our operations and are also used by analysts, investment banks and lenders for the same purpose. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure being used as a key element of the company-wide bonus incentive plan. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enables a more consistent measurement of period to period performance of our operations, and EBITDA facilitates comparison of our operating performance to companies in our industry.\nWe believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures are particularly important in a capital intensive industry such as ours, in which our current period depreciation is not a good indication of our current or future period capital expenditures. The cost to construct and launch a satellite and to build the related ground infrastructure may vary greatly from one satellite to another, depending on the satellite's size, type and capabilities. Current depreciation expense is not indicative of the revenue generating potential of the satellites.\nEBITDA excludes interest income, interest expense and income taxes because these items are associated with our capitalization and tax structures. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non-cash expenses reflect the impact of prior capital expenditure decisions, which are not indicative of future capital expenditure requirements. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA to exclude restructuring, other re-engineering, integration, acquisition costs, and loss from early extinguishment of debt, as these are non-core items.\nRestructuring charges incurred in 2013 and 2014 are costs incurred to realize efficiencies from the acquisition of GeoEye, such as reducing excess workforce, consolidating facilities and systems, and relocating ground terminals. Restructuring charges incurred in 2015 relate to our re-engineering and restructuring plans announced in 2015, pursuant to which the Company has and expects to continue to reduce global headcount and rationalize our real estate footprint. Other re-engineering charges are associated with the re-engineering and restructuring plans announced in 2015 and represent costs incurred to realize efficiencies from reducing headcount, such as re-engineering processes and enhancing system workflows, as well as costs related to the decision to proactively decommission IKONOS. Integration costs consist primarily of professional fees incurred to assist us with system and process improvements associated with integrating operations as part of the GeoEye acquisition. Acquisition costs are costs incurred to effect the GeoEye acquisition, such as advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other professional fees. Loss from early extinguishment of debt is related to the 2013 Credit Facility and Senior Notes, the proceeds of which were used to refinance our $500.0 million senior secured term loan and $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, and to fund the discharge and redemption of GeoEye's $525.0 million senior secured notes that we assumed in the acquisition. Additionally, it excludes the gain on subsidiary disposition and joint venture losses because these are non-core items that are not related to our primary operations.\nWe use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with traditional U.S. GAAP operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, and we do not place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures as our only measures of operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nReconciliation of Net Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n329.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n224.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n112.3 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash flows used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(169.9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(264.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(794.5) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n524.0 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n159.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(158.2) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash flows provided by operating activities less net cash flows used in investing activities (excluding acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired). Free cash flow is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and may not be defined similarly by other companies. Free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to operating income (loss),\u201d net income (loss),\u201d net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\u201d or any other measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure - net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\u201d because it provides information about the amount of cash generated before acquisitions of businesses that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities. There are limitations to using non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies in different industries that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from ours.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe policies and estimates discussed in this section are considered critical because they had or could have a material impact on our financial statements, and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nApplication of U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the use of judgments and estimates. Specifically, judgment is used in interpreting complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions and determining when all criteria for revenue recognition have been met. In addition, the Company enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. Judgment is required to properly identify the units of accounting in transactions with multiple deliverables and to determine how revenue shall be allocated to those units of accounting. The Company has not historically been able to establish vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value or third-party evidence of selling price when allocating consideration as part of a multiple-element arrangement due to the unique nature of our products and services and lack of visibility into competitor pricing. Therefore, relative selling prices are determined on the basis of the best estimate of the selling price ( BESP\u201d). The Company's process for determining BESP involves judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary depending on the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to market conditions, competitive landscape, geographic or regional specific factors, internal costs, profit margin objectives and pricing practices used by the Company.\nSatellite Useful Lives\nThe estimated useful life over which we depreciate a satellite is determined once the satellite has been placed into orbit. The initial determination of the satellite useful life involves a complex calculation that considers random part failure probabilities, expected component degradation and cycle life, predicted fuel consumption, and other factors.\nAt least annually, or more frequently should facts and circumstances indicate, the Company performs an assessment of the remaining useful lives of its satellites. The assessment evaluates on-orbit performance, remaining fuel, remaining anticipated component cycle life and durability, environmental and operational stresses and other factors that may impact the satellite's useful life. Any change in the useful lives of satellites is accounted for on a prospective basis from the date of change, generally as of the first day of the quarter in which the change is made.\nAs a result of the Company's satellite life review in 2015, there were no changes to the estimated useful lives of our satellites for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of the Company's satellite life review in 2014, the Company extended the useful lives of each of WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 to 13 years. The useful life extensions resulted in non-cash reductions to depreciation expense prospectively from October 1, 2014. Certain cash payments received in connection with our NextView contract prior to WorldView-1 being placed into service were deferred and are being recognized to revenue over the life of WorldView-1. The useful life extension of WorldView-1 lengthened the period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized. Satellite useful lives are also used by the Company as a proxy for determining the estimated customer relationship period when evaluating the duration over which to amortize upfront fees in DAP contracts. In the event a DAP customer has access to multiple satellites under the same arrangement, the longest-lived satellite life is generally used. Therefore, any change in the estimated useful lives of our satellites would also impact upfront fee revenues and deferred contract costs on a prospective basis from the date of change. The extension of the life of WorldView-2 lengthened the period over which revenue is recognized on upfront fees and deferred contract costs are amortized.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in the business are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances warrant such a review. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to: a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used; a significant adverse change in the operations of the Company's satellites; a change in government spending or customer demand that could affect the value of the asset group; a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset group; or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset group.\nOur satellite constellation and related assets, including satellites under construction, are evaluated as a single asset group whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are identified, recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including the allocation of cash flows to assets or asset groups and, if required, an estimate of fair value for those assets or asset groups. There were no impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Factors that may result in an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to: a change in identified reporting units; an adverse change in business conditions; a prolonged decline in our stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value; a significant adverse change in government spending or customer demand; or impairment of long-lived assets.\nThe Company's market capitalization was below book value during the three months ended December 31, 2015, which generally coincided with the timing of our annual testing date. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative impairment test and determined that goodwill was not impaired. The Company determined fair value of its single reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis ( DCF\u201d), which requires the use of significant judgments and estimates. The significant estimates and assumptions included: a) the amount and timing of future cash flows, which is largely based on the Company's long range plan; b) working capital requirements; c) future capital expenditure requirements; d) estimation of a long-term growth rate; and e) the determination of an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate utilized in the DCF analysis is based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the weights of each component of capital structure and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment.\nBased upon the valuation performed, the fair value of the Company's single reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 35%. In order to further assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair value, we corroborated the valuation with market-based information such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in business acquisitions. Those analyses supported our fair value determination.\nThere was no goodwill impairment recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, or 2013.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition. Determining the fair value of an intangible asset may require the use of significant management estimates and assumptions, including expected future cash flows and discount rates. Management's estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\nIncome Taxes\nThe current provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed each year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The carrying value of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon the judgmental assessment of available evidence, it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable.\nThe Company utilizes a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes.\nThe recognition of a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position would result in a reduction to net income and could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial position in any given period.\nRecent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nDigitalGlobe is a leading global provider of high-resolution Earth-imagery products and services sourced from our own advanced satellite constellation and third-party providers. Our imagery solutions support a wide variety of users in defense and intelligence, civil agencies, mapping and analysis, environmental monitoring, oil and gas exploration, infrastructure management, Internet portals, and navigation technology. Each day users depend on us to better understand our changing planet in order to save lives, resources and time.\nOur principal customers include U.S. and foreign governments, LBS providers, and those in energy and other industry verticals. The imagery that forms the foundation of our products, services and analysis is collected daily from our constellation of high-resolution imaging satellites and maintained in our ImageLibrary. We believe that our ImageLibrary is the largest, most up-to-date and comprehensive archive of high-resolution Earth imagery commercially available, containing more than 6.4 billion square kilometers of imagery, an area the equivalent of 43 times the landmass of the Earth, accumulated since 1999. As of December 31, 2015, our collection capacity capability was approximately 1.37 billion square kilometers of imagery per year, or the equivalent of roughly 9 times the Earth's land surface area, and offers intraday revisit around the globe.\n2015 Highlights\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn October 2015, the Company's Board of Directors increased authorized share repurchases of the Company's outstanding common stock to $335.0 million through December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we have repurchased a total of 8,962,786 shares at an average purchase price of $24.50 per share, for a total of $219.6 million under the program. Refer to Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d in Item 5 of this Form 10-K for further detail.\nRe-engineering and Restructuring Plans\nIn February 2015, the Company initiated a re-engineering and restructuring plan intended to improve our operational efficiency. The Company expects to incur approximately $12.0 million of the originally anticipated $15.0 million as a result of these efforts, which include restructuring charges to reduce global headcount and rationalize our real estate footprint, and other re-engineering charges to realize efficiencies from reducing headcount, such as re-engineering processes and enhancing system workflows, as well as costs related to the decision to proactively decommission IKONOS. The decrease in expected spend results primarily from lower than anticipated lease termination fees associated with the consolidation of our real estate footprint. We expect to complete this plan and realize the benefits resulting from our efforts by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nIn October 2015, the Company initiated a separate re-engineering and restructuring plan, in which the Company may incur up to an additional $18.0 million in an effort to further reduce global headcount, rationalize its real estate footprint, realize efficiencies from re-engineering processes and enhancing system workflows, and undertake other efficiency initiatives. We expect to complete this plan and realize the benefits resulting from our efforts by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe benefits realized from these plans may be partially offset by higher operating costs associated with growth in our business. The following table summarizes costs incurred and those that we expect to incur under each plan as of December 31, 2015:\n\nRecent Satellite Developments\nWe continue to make certain necessary enhancements to our WorldView-4 satellite, and intend to launch the satellite in the third quarter of 2016 for additional capacity as a result of anticipated incremental growth opportunities. We continue to receive early contractual agreements and letters of intent for direct access capacity from international defense and intelligence customers. We anticipate that these pre-launch commitments will generate incremental revenue in 2017, when the satellite is expected to begin commercial operations.\nResults of Operations\nWe operate in a single segment in which we use common infrastructure and technology to collect, process and distribute imagery products and services to customers around the world. The following tables summarize our results of operations:\n\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of total revenue:\n\nRevenue\nOur principal source of revenue is the licensing of Earth-imagery products and provision of other services to end users, resellers and partners. We have organized our sales leadership and marketing efforts around U.S. Government and Diversified Commercial customer groups.\nU.S. Government\n\nU.S. Government revenue consists primarily of the EnhancedView SLA, other revenue and value-added services, and amortization of pre-FOC payments related to the NextView agreement with the NGA. The NGA purchases our imagery products and services on behalf of various U.S. Government entities, including the military and other agencies. Other U.S. defense and intelligence customers, including contractors, purchase value-added services with our imagery. Our U.S. Government customers focus on image quality, including resolution, accuracy, spectral diversity, frequency of area revisit, coverage, and availability of certain amounts of our capacity, as they integrate our products and services into their operational planning. Revenue is generated largely from service level agreements, tasking orders and sales of imagery from our ImageLibrary, in addition to sales of geospatial analytic products and expert services that obtain insight from our imagery. We sell to the U.S. Government primarily through direct sales.\nU.S. Government revenue increased $52.3 million, or 13.2%, from 2014 to 2015. EnhancedView SLA revenue increased as a result of WorldView-3 becoming fully operational on October 1, 2014, which increased constellation capacity made available to the NGA. Other revenue and value-added services declined primarily due to a decrease in non-cash amortization of Global EGD deferred revenue. The decrease in the non-cash amortization of pre-FOC payments related to NextView resulted from the extension of the period over which these payments are amortized to reflect the fourth quarter of 2014 extension of the useful life of WorldView-1.\nU.S. Government revenue increased $37.2 million, or 10.4%, from 2013 to 2014. EnhancedView SLA revenue increased as a result of WorldView-3 becoming fully operational on October 1, 2014, which increased constellation capacity made available to the NGA. Other revenue and value-added services increased primarily due to expanded services under Global EGD. The decrease in the non-cash amortization of pre-FOC payments related to NextView resulted from the extension of the period over which these payments are amortized to reflect the fourth quarter of 2014 extension of the useful life of WorldView-1.\nDiversified Commercial\n\nDiversified Commercial consists of the following types of customers: DAP, international civil government, LBS, energy, other international defense and intelligence, and other industry verticals. We sell products and services to these customers throughout the world both directly and through resellers. We have DAP agreements in 10 countries, earning revenue from sales of DAP facilities and from service fees to access our satellite constellation. Other diversified commercial customers use our content for mapping, monitoring, analysis and planning activities.\nDiversified Commercial revenue decreased $4.5 million, or 1.7%, from 2014 to 2015. DAP revenue increased from additional image deliveries and access minutes to meet customer demands, primarily driven by multiple crises in the Middle East. Other diversified commercial decreased as a result of lower LBS revenue and the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on certain of our non-U.S. customers.\nDiversified Commercial revenue increased $4.7 million, or 1.8%, from 2013 to 2014. DAP revenue increased primarily due to the impact of activating additional direct access customers. Other diversified commercial decreased primarily due to lower revenue from customers in Russia of $14.5 million and a one-time data delivery in 2013 totaling $5.9 million, partially offset by growth within our energy vertical.\nExpenses\nCost of Revenue\nThe following table summarizes our cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization:\n\nThere is not a significant direct relationship between our cost of revenue and changes in our revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of personnel, as well as the costs of operating our satellites, retrieving information from the satellites and processing the data retrieved.\nCost of revenue decreased $15.5 million, or 9.7%, from 2014 to 2015. Labor and labor-related costs decreased primarily from lower headcount in connection with our restructuring efforts and a reduction in incentive compensation due to lower than expected revenue growth. Facilities, subcontracting and equipment costs decreased primarily as a result of our re-engineering and restructuring efforts and a net decrease in remote ground terminal service fees impacted by negotiation of lower contract rates, which were partially offset by an increase in fees following the launch and commissioning of WorldView-3. The decrease in other direct costs was impacted by aerial imagery, which is amortized on an accelerated basis and consists of costs associated with previously purchased aerial imagery.\nCost of revenue decreased $14.9 million, or 8.5%, from 2013 to 2014. Labor and labor-related costs decreased primarily as a result of our restructuring efforts, partially offset by an additional month of expenses for employees assumed in connection with the GeoEye acquisition totaling $3.2 million. Facilities, subcontracting and equipment costs decreased primarily due to the consolidation of ground terminals and related telecommunication contracts in connection with the GeoEye acquisition, partially offset by an additional month of expense associated with the remaining ground terminals acquired totaling $2.0 million. Consulting and professional fees decreased primarily due to reduced services needed to support the integration of GeoEye.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our selling, general and administrative expenses:\n\n* Not meaningful\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $14.5 million, or 6.5%, from 2014 to 2015. Labor and labor-related costs decreased primarily from lower headcount in connection with our restructuring efforts and a reduction in incentive compensation due to lower than expected revenue growth. Consulting and professional fees decreased primarily from our re-engineering and restructuring efforts. The increase in rent and facilities represents costs associated with our new headquarters. Satellite insurance increased as a result of a full year of WorldView-3 insurance, partially offset by a decrease in premiums to insure our other in-orbit satellites.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $35.8 million, or 13.9%, from 2013 to 2014. Acquisition costs were incurred in 2013 as part of the GeoEye acquisition. Labor and labor-related costs increased primarily due to $3.4 million in non-combination related severance expenses, an additional month of expenses for employees assumed in connection with the GeoEye acquisition totaling $2.5 million, and higher headcount, including contractor conversions, to support growth in our business. Consulting and professional fees decreased primarily due to reduced services needed to support the integration of GeoEye. Rent and facilities decreased primarily due to the consolidation of facilities and related telecommunication contracts following our acquisition of GeoEye. Computer hardware and software increased primarily from an additional month of expenses associated with the GeoEye acquisition. The decrease in satellite insurance is primarily due to a reduction in rates to insure our in-orbit satellites, partially offset by WorldView-3 launch insurance expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $41.0 million, or 17.1%, from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to higher depreciation expense of $42.4 million following the launch and commissioning of WorldView-3 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a $17.6 million increase in hardware and software expense primarily from assets placed into service in 2015, partially offset by a $21.4 million decrease in depreciation expense as a result of the fourth quarter of 2014 extension of the useful lives of our WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 satellites.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $14.9 million, or 6.6%, from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to higher depreciation expense of $14.1 million following the launch and commissioning of WorldView-3 and an additional month of expense for property, equipment and intangible assets assumed in the GeoEye acquisition totaling $7.1 million, partially offset by a $7.2 million decrease in expense as a result of the extension of the fourth quarter of 2014 extension of the useful lives of our WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 satellites.\nRestructuring Charges\n\nIn 2015, the Company initiated two restructuring plans intended to improve our operational efficiency. Under the restructuring plans, the Company has and expects to continue to reduce global headcount and rationalize its real estate footprint. Restructuring charges incurred in 2015 relate to these plans. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further detail.\nRestructuring charges in 2013 and 2014 were incurred in conjunction with our acquisition of GeoEye to optimize our operational efficiency by realigning our infrastructure with customer demand. These restructuring activities primarily consisted of reducing redundant workforce, consolidating office and production facilities, consolidating certain ground terminals and systems, and other exit costs.\nInterest Expense, net\n\nOur interest charges are primarily associated with borrowings used to finance construction of our satellites, which are capitalized as a cost of satellite construction.\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest of $30.5 million, increased $21.9 million from 2014 to 2015 primarily as a result of the capitalization of 51.0% of interest to capital projects in 2015 compared to 87.8% in 2014. We ceased capitalizing interest on the cost basis of WorldView-3 following its launch and commissioning on October 1, 2014, and we did not capitalize interest on the cost basis of WorldView-4 while the satellite was in storage from December 2014 until mid-March 2015.\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest of $52.5 million, increased $3.7 million, or 108.8%, from 2013 to 2014 primarily as a result of the capitalization of 87.8% of interest to capital projects in 2014 compared to 93.4% in 2013.\nLoss from Early Extinguishment of Debt\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of GeoEye, we entered into the 2013 Credit Facility, issued Senior Notes and retired our previous credit facility. We recorded a loss of $17.8 million during 2013 due to the write-off of $12.8 million of unamortized deferred financing fees and debt discount associated with the previous credit facility, in addition to the incurrence of $5.0 million of fees paid in connection with the 2013 Credit Facility and Senior Notes.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\n\nIncome tax expense increased $2.3 million, or 33.3%, from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to higher current year pre-tax income. In 2015, we had an overall effective tax rate of 28.3%. The effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal rate of 35% primarily due to federal research and development credits.\nIncome tax benefit decreased $44.4 million from 2013 to 2014 principally due to pre-tax profits generated in 2014 compared to a pre-tax loss reported in 2013. In 2014, we had an overall effective tax rate of 27.3%. The effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal rate of 35.0% primarily due to the release of a $2.4 million uncertain tax position reserve upon completion of an IRS examination.\nBacklog\nThe following table represents our backlog as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nBacklog consists of all contractual commitments, including those under the anticipated ten-year term of the EnhancedView SLA we entered into with the NGA in August 2010, amounts committed under DAP agreements, firm orders, minimum commitments under signed customer contracts, remaining pre-paid subscriptions, firm fixed price reimbursement, and funded and unfunded task orders from our customers. Our backlog also includes amounts of obligated funding on indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ( IDIQ\u201d) contracts for products and services that we believe we are qualified to provide.\nThe EnhancedView SLA is structured as a ten-year term, inclusive of nine annual renewal options that may be exercised by the NGA. In July 2015, the NGA exercised its renewal option for year six under the EnhancedView SLA through August 31, 2016. Although the NGA may terminate the contract at any time and is not obligated to exercise any of the remaining four renewal options, we include the full remaining term in backlog. While funding contains an inherent level of uncertainty, we believe it is the NGA's intention to exercise the remaining options, subject only to annual Congressional appropriation of funding and the federal budget process.\nOther revenue and value-added services primarily include the Global EGD program under the EnhancedView Contract and various other products and services provided to the NGA.\nThe amortization of pre-FOC payments related to our NextView agreement with the NGA is recognized over the expected useful life of WorldView-1. The recognition of this revenue has no effect on our ability to generate additional revenue from the usage of the satellite, and we do not consider it a reduction in our capacity to generate additional sales. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, the period of recognition was extended to reflect the extension of the useful life of WorldView-1 by 2.5 years, to the fourth quarter of 2020, and the remaining deferred revenue balance will be recognized over the longer remaining term on a prospective basis. This change reduced the recognition of NextView revenue by $10.4 million annually.\nAmounts committed under DAP agreements for the next twelve months increased primarily as a result of the timing of contract renewals. Other diversified commercial backlog decreased primarily due to the elimination of minimum commitments under certain customer contracts. As a result, year over year changes in backlog for the next twelve months are not necessarily indicative of revenue expected to be recognized in 2016. DAP commitments over the life of contracts increased primarily as a result of early contractual agreements on our WorldView-4 satellite and increased customer commitments on our WorldView-3 satellite.\nAlthough backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, terminations, amendments or cancellations may occur, which could result in a reduction in our total backlog. In addition, failure to receive task orders under IDIQ contracts could also result in a reduction in our total backlog. Any such terminations, amendments or cancellations of contractual commitments, or failure to receive task orders under IDIQ contracts may also negatively impact the timing of our realization of backlog.\nBalance Sheet Measures\nTotal assets of $2,925.1 million decreased $146.1 million, or 4.8%, from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a $94.5 million decrease in property, plant and equipment, net, as a result of current year depreciation expense, partially offset by costs incurred related to WorldView-4, leasehold improvements associated with our new headquarters and various other infrastructure projects, in addition to a $42.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, net, primarily due to a one-time additional payment received from the NGA totaling $25.0 million based upon contract terms, and improved customer collections. These decreases were partially offset by an $8.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily from the step-up of EnhancedView SLA payments and improved customer collections, partially offset by cash used in connection with our share repurchase program.\nTotal liabilities of $1,677.0 million decreased $40.7 million, or 2.4%, from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a $61.8 million decrease in deferred revenue resulting from current year recognition of U.S. government revenue, partially offset by a $26.7 million increase in other liabilities primarily related to a tenant improvement allowance and capital lease obligation associated with our new headquarters.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $126.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company's cash equivalents primarily consist of U.S. Treasury and demand deposit money market accounts. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, as well as the cash we generate from our operations. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, we had $150.0 million available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur primary liquidity and capital requirements are for satellite construction and maintenance, working capital, our share repurchase program, and general corporate needs. We believe that the combination of funds currently available to us and funds expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to finance our operations and development activities for at least the next twelve months. If the U.S. Government, our largest customer, was not to renew or extend the EnhancedView SLA at similar levels or similar terms, we believe we would be able to maintain operations at a reduced level with existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity for at least the next twelve months. Furthermore, we believe we are adequately reserved for receivables denominated in U.S. dollars from foreign customers experiencing fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies.\nWe maintain a strong focus on liquidity, and do not anticipate significant changes to our existing capital structure. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our debt covenants, and expect compliance with our covenants to continue.\nIn summary, our cash flows were:\n\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations is revenue generated by sales of satellite imagery products and services. We also generate cash through sales of geospatial analytic products and expert services to obtain insight from our imagery. The primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments for labor and labor-related costs, costs associated with operating our ground terminals, construction of DAP facilities, interest on our long-term debt, and other general corporate expenditures. Our sources and uses for cash flows from operations will likely remain consistent through 2016, though we expect our working capital needs to decrease in future periods through benefits realized from our restructuring plans. These benefits may, however, be partially offset by higher operating costs associated with growth in our business.\nCash provided by operating activities increased $104.8 million from 2014 to 2015, primarily due to increased net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, and a net increase in cash from changes in working capital, primarily driven by accounts receivable, accounts payable, and deferred revenue. Working capital was impacted by a one-time additional payment received from the NGA totaling $25.0 million based upon contract terms, and tenant improvement reimbursements totaling $20.3 million associated with our new headquarters.\nCash provided by operating activities increased $112.6 million from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, which was principally due to costs incurred in 2013 in connection with our acquisition of GeoEye.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment, including assets under construction, as well as business acquisitions. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2015 and those planned for 2016 are for satellite construction and maintenance costs. We expect to make capital expenditures on our WorldView-4 satellite until its completion and launch, which we anticipate to be in the third quarter of 2016. We will begin to replace the combined capacity of WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 in either 2017 or 2018, depending on capacity utilization, the projected lives of our in-orbit satellites at that time, and the needs of our customers. We anticipate an approximate four- year build cycle for a total cost not to exceed $600 million, excluding capitalized interest.\nCash used in investing activities decreased $94.7 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulting from placing our WorldView-3 satellite into service in October 2014, in addition to the acquisition of Spatial Energy, net of cash acquired, in the first quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we have incurred $163.4 million in capital expenditures, which includes capitalized interest of $32.1 million and a tenant improvement allowance of $20.3 million associated with our new headquarters.\nCash used in investing activities decreased $529.9 million from 2013 to 2014 principally due to the 2013 acquisition of GeoEye, net of cash acquired, totaling $524.0 million and a $53.1 million decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulting from placing our WorldView-3 satellite into service in October 2014. These decreases were partially offset by the 2014 acquisition of Spatial Energy, net of cash acquired, totaling $35.7 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities consists primarily of stock buybacks as part of our share repurchase program, principal payments made on our long-term debt, proceeds from stock option exercises and preferred stock dividend payments. We expect these cash usage trends to remain consistent in 2016, with stock buybacks continuing to be a significant expenditure. In October 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved an additional $130.0 million of authorized share repurchases of the Company's outstanding common stock through December 31, 2016, increasing the total authorized amount under the program to $335.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $115.6 million of shares may be purchased under the program.\nCash used in financing activities increased $79.9 million from 2014 to 2015 primarily as a result of our share repurchase program.\nCash provided by financing activities decreased $736.7 million from 2013 to 2014 principally due to the 2013 debt refinancing in connection with our acquisition of GeoEye and our share repurchase program initiated in 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Guaranty and Indemnification Obligations\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\n\nLong-term debt obligations represent principal and interest payments to be made over the lives of our Term Loan and Senior Notes. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further detail. Capital lease obligations were primarily incurred in connection with our new headquarters. Our operating leases are primarily for office space in the United States. We generally believe leasing office space is more cost-effective than purchasing real estate for our existing operating locations. Other contractual obligations are remaining amounts due on long-term contracts primarily relating to the construction of our WorldView-4 satellite, including the launch vehicle, and operational commitments related to our remote ground terminals, in addition to our obligation to provide equity financing to the Vricon joint venture to the extent third-party financing is not obtained.\nGuaranty and Indemnification Obligations\nWe enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with resellers and others. Most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third-party claims alleging that one of our products infringes or misappropriates a patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right. Certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against claims relating to property damage, personal injury or acts or omissions by us, our employees, agents or representatives. In addition, from time to time we have made guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers. The majority of these agreements do not limit the maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and may not be defined similarly by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indications of financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operations as measures of liquidity. There are limitations to using non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies in different industries that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from ours.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are key measures used in our internal operating reports by management and our Board of Directors to evaluate the performance of our operations and are also used by analysts, investment banks and lenders for the same purpose. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure being used as a key element of the company-wide bonus incentive plan. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enables a more consistent measurement of period to period performance of our operations, and EBITDA facilitates comparison of our operating performance to companies in our industry.\nWe believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures are particularly important in a capital intensive industry such as ours, in which our current period depreciation is not a good indication of our current or future period capital expenditures. The cost to construct and launch a satellite and to build the related ground infrastructure may vary greatly from one satellite to another, depending on the satellite's size, type and capabilities. Current depreciation expense is not indicative of the revenue generating potential of the satellites.\nEBITDA excludes interest income, interest expense and income taxes because these items are associated with our capitalization and tax structures. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non-cash expenses reflect the impact of prior capital expenditure decisions, which are not indicative of future capital expenditure requirements. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA to exclude restructuring, other re-engineering, integration, acquisition costs, and loss from early extinguishment of debt, as these are non-core items.\nRestructuring charges incurred in 2013 and 2014 are costs incurred to realize efficiencies from the acquisition of GeoEye, such as reducing excess workforce, consolidating facilities and systems, and relocating ground terminals. Restructuring charges incurred in 2015 relate to our re-engineering and restructuring plans announced in 2015, pursuant to which the Company has and expects to continue to reduce global headcount and rationalize our real estate footprint. Other re-engineering charges are associated with the re-engineering and restructuring plans announced in 2015 and represent costs incurred to realize efficiencies from reducing headcount, such as re-engineering processes and enhancing system workflows, as well as costs related to the decision to proactively decommission IKONOS. Integration costs consist primarily of professional fees incurred to assist us with system and process improvements associated with integrating operations as part of the GeoEye acquisition. Acquisition costs are costs incurred to effect the GeoEye acquisition, such as advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other professional fees. Loss from early extinguishment of debt is related to the 2013 Credit Facility and Senior Notes, the proceeds of which were used to refinance our $500.0 million senior secured term loan and $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, and to fund the discharge and redemption of GeoEye's $525.0 million senior secured notes that we assumed in the acquisition. Additionally, it excludes the gain on subsidiary disposition and joint venture losses because these are non-core items that are not related to our primary operations.\nWe use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with traditional U.S. GAAP operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, and we do not place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures as our only measures of operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nReconciliation of Net Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash flows provided by operating activities less net cash flows used in investing activities (excluding acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired). Free cash flow is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and may not be defined similarly by other companies. Free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to operating income (loss),\u201d net income (loss),\u201d net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\u201d or any other measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure - net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\u201d because it provides information about the amount of cash generated before acquisitions of businesses that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities. There are limitations to using non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies in different industries that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from ours.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe policies and estimates discussed in this section are considered critical because they had or could have a material impact on our financial statements, and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nApplication of U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the use of judgments and estimates. Specifically, judgment is used in interpreting complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions and determining when all criteria for revenue recognition have been met. In addition, the Company enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. Judgment is required to properly identify the units of accounting in transactions with multiple deliverables and to determine how revenue shall be allocated to those units of accounting. The Company has not historically been able to establish vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value or third-party evidence of selling price when allocating consideration as part of a multiple-element arrangement due to the unique nature of our products and services and lack of visibility into competitor pricing. Therefore, relative selling prices are determined on the basis of the best estimate of the selling price ( BESP\u201d). The Company's process for determining BESP involves judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary depending on the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to market conditions, competitive landscape, geographic or regional specific factors, internal costs, profit margin objectives and pricing practices used by the Company.\nSatellite Useful Lives\nThe estimated useful life over which we depreciate a satellite is determined once the satellite has been placed into orbit. The initial determination of the satellite useful life involves a complex calculation that considers random part failure probabilities, expected component degradation and cycle life, predicted fuel consumption, and other factors.\nAt least annually, or more frequently should facts and circumstances indicate, the Company performs an assessment of the remaining useful lives of its satellites. The assessment evaluates on-orbit performance, remaining fuel, remaining anticipated component cycle life and durability, environmental and operational stresses and other factors that may impact the satellite's useful life. Any change in the useful lives of satellites is accounted for on a prospective basis from the date of change, generally as of the first day of the quarter in which the change is made.\nAs a result of the Company's satellite life review in 2015, there were no changes to the estimated useful lives of our satellites for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of the Company's satellite life review in 2014, the Company extended the useful lives of each of WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 to 13 years. The useful life extensions resulted in non-cash reductions to depreciation expense prospectively from October 1, 2014. Certain cash payments received in connection with our NextView contract prior to WorldView-1 being placed into service were deferred and are being recognized to revenue over the life of WorldView-1. The useful life extension of WorldView-1 lengthened the period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized. Satellite useful lives are also used by the Company as a proxy for determining the estimated customer relationship period when evaluating the duration over which to amortize upfront fees in DAP contracts. In the event a DAP customer has access to multiple satellites under the same arrangement, the longest-lived satellite life is generally used. Therefore, any change in the estimated useful lives of our satellites would also impact upfront fee revenues and deferred contract costs on a prospective basis from the date of change. The extension of the life of WorldView-2 lengthened the period over which revenue is recognized on upfront fees and deferred contract costs are amortized.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in the business are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances warrant such a review. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to: a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used; a significant adverse change in the operations of the Company's satellites; a change in government spending or customer demand that could affect the value of the asset group; a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset group; or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset group.\nOur satellite constellation and related assets, including satellites under construction, are evaluated as a single asset group whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are identified, recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including the allocation of cash flows to assets or asset groups and, if required, an estimate of fair value for those assets or asset groups. There were no impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Factors that may result in an interim impairment test include, but are not limited to: a change in identified reporting units; an adverse change in business conditions; a prolonged decline in our stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value; a significant adverse change in government spending or customer demand; or impairment of long-lived assets.\nThe Company's market capitalization was below book value during the three months ended December 31, 2015, which generally coincided with the timing of our annual testing date. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative impairment test and determined that goodwill was not impaired. The Company determined fair value of its single reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis ( DCF\u201d), which requires the use of significant judgments and estimates. The significant estimates and assumptions included: a) the amount and timing of future cash flows, which is largely based on the Company's long range plan; b) working capital requirements; c) future capital expenditure requirements; d) estimation of a long-term growth rate; and e) the determination of an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate utilized in the DCF analysis is based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the weights of each component of capital structure and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment.\nBased upon the valuation performed, the fair value of the Company's single reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 35%. In order to further assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair value, we corroborated the valuation with market-based information such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in business acquisitions. Those analyses supported our fair value determination.\nThere was no goodwill impairment recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, or 2013.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition. Determining the fair value of an intangible asset may require the use of significant management estimates and assumptions, including expected future cash flows and discount rates. Management's estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\nIncome Taxes\nThe current provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed each year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The carrying value of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon the judgmental assessment of available evidence, it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable.\nThe Company utilizes a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes.\nThe recognition of a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position would result in a reduction to net income and could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial

excerpt from the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of DigitalGlobe's Financial Condition and Results of Operations:\n\nDigitalGlobe Overview:\n- DigitalGlobe is a leading Earth-imagery product and services provider, utilizing satellite technology for a variety of users including defense, intelligence, and commercial industries.\n- They maintain the largest and most up-to-date archive of high-resolution Earth imagery (over 6.4 billion square kilometers) and have a collection capacity capability of approximately 1.37 billion square kilometers of imagery per year.\n- Key customers are U.S. and foreign governments and industries such as energy.\n\n2015 Highlights:\n- DigitalGlobe increased its authorized share repurchase program to $335 million, with $219.6 million used by end of 2015.\n- A re-engineering and restructuring plan was initiated to improve operational efficiency with estimated incurred and expected costs around $12 million.\n- A separate re-engineering and restructuring plan was also initiated, expected to incur up to $18 million in costs, to further reduce global headcount and realize efficiencies.\n\nRecent Satellite Developments:\n- Enhancements are being made to the WorldView-4 satellite for a planned launch in Q3 2016, with expectations of incremental revenue in 2017.\n- Commitments from international defense and intelligence customers have been received for this satellite's capacity.\n\nResults of Operations:\n- The Company operates a single segment that provides imagery products and services globally.\n- U.S. Government revenue makes up a large portion of the company's revenue, followed by Diversified Commercial revenue.\n\nRevenue:\n- Primary sources are licensing of Earth-imagery products and services.\n- U.S. Government revenue increased, mainly due to an operational WorldView-3 satellite and overall EnhancedView SLA revenue.\n- Diversified Commercial revenue decreased slightly due to lower revenue from certain sectors and currency fluctuations.\n\nExpenses:\n- The cost of revenue is primarily made up of personnel costs and operating satellites, which decreased due to restructuring efforts and lower incentive compensation.\n- Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to labor reductions and consulting/professional fee reductions.\n- Depreciation and amortization expenses increased mainly due to WorldView-3 satellite operations.\n- Restructuring charges were incurred for enhancing operational efficiency.\n\nBacklog:\n- DigitalGlobe's contractual commitments and backlog amounted to $2.2 billion over the life of contracts.\n\nBalance Sheet Measures:\n- Total assets decreased by $146.1 million, while total liabilities decreased by $40.7 million.\n- Cash and cash equivalents increased by $8.3 million mainly due to improved collections and timing of payments.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\n- The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to cover at least the next 12 months\u2019 operations through a combination of cash, cash equivalents, and expected cash flows from operations.\n- Major uses of cash include satellite construction, share repurchase program, and general corporate activities.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations:\n- No off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015.\n- Long-term debt obligations, operating leases, and other contractual obligations amount to $1.8 billion.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates:\n- Key judgments are used in revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets and satellites' useful lives, impairment of assets, goodwill, and income taxes.\n\nRecent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements:\n- Recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on the financial statements are described in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThis summary captures the main points of DigitalGlobe's financial and operational performance, strategic initiatives, main sources of revenue, cost management, investments and expansions, liquidity, critical accounting policies, and future accounting standards impact as discussed in the MD&A report for the year ended December 31, 2015."}
