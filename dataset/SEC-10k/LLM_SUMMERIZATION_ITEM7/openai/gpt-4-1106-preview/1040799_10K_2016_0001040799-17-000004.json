Our core products consist of loans secured by real estate, commercial and consumer loans, as well as various deposit products to meet our customers' needs. Our primary source of income is generated from net interest margin, the difference between interest income received on our loans and securities and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. Our income is also affected by our ability to price our products competitively and maximize the interest rate spread between the interest yield on loans and securities and the interest rate paid on deposits and borrowings. Our products also generate other income through product related fees and commissions. We incur operating expenses consisting primarily of salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment, technology and other professional and miscellaneous expenses. Refer to Item 1. Business, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of the business.\nRecent Events\nOn March 8, 2017, the Company completed the Reverse Stock Split and the number of authorized shares of common stock was reduced from 80,000,000 to 16,000,000. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and any fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share. All share and share-related information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the decreased number of shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOverview\nTotal assets were $719.9 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $691.4 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $28.5 million or 4.1%. Cash and cash equivalents were $32.6 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $26.8 million at December 31, 2015. The investment portfolio decreased $26.3 million or 19.4% during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016, from $135.6 million at December 31, 2015, to $109.3 million at December 31, 2016. Strong loan demand offset the reductions in the investment portfolio resulting in growth of $48.7 million or 10.6% as outstanding gross loans grew to $507.0 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $458.3 million at December 31, 2015. Investments in life insurance totaled $20.0 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $14.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $5.2 million, which was primarily due to a $5.0 million additional investment in life insurance executed in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal liabilities were $651.9 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $20.9 million or 3.3%, from $631.0 million at December 31, 2015. Total deposits increased $11.2 million or 2.1% during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016, from $542.3 million at December 31, 2015, to $553.5 million at December 31, 2016. Demand, savings, and money market deposit accounts increased $40.0 million or 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaling $352.3 million compared to $312.3 million as of December 31, 2015. This growth was offset by reductions in time deposits of $28.8 million or 12.5%, which totaled $201.3 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $230.1 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term borrowings were $70.0 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $60.0 million at December 31, 2015. Total shareholders' equity increased $7.6 million or 12.6% ending the year at $68.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2016, nonperforming assets had declined $2.4 million or 28.2% when compared to December 31, 2015. The Company's ratio of nonperforming assets to regulatory Tier 1 capital plus the allowance has also improved during the year falling from 12% at December 31, 2015, to 7.9% at December 31, 2016.\nPrior to 2010, for 73 consecutive years, we paid dividends (prior to 1997 when we reorganized into a holding company, it was our wholly-owned subsidiary, Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company, which paid dividends). We suspended dividends in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to losses for the year and continue to monitor our ability to pay dividends based on our risk profile, capital levels, and expected earnings.\nThe following table indicates the ratios for return on average assets and average equity, dividend payout, and average equity to average assets in addition to earnings (loss) per common share and book value per common share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of and for the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Ratios:\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td>0.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.50\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average equity\n</td> <td>10.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.09\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend payout ratio\n</td> <td>0.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average equity to average assets\n</td> <td>8.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.85\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings (Loss) per Common Share(1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic earnings per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book Value per Common Share(1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book value per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Per common share amounts used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share, as well as book value per common share, were adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.\nInvestment Portfolio\nOur investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016 consists of primarily residential mortgage-backed securities (\"MBSs\") and taxable municipal securities. The MBSs consist of fixed-rate mortgage securities underwritten and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae (\"GNMA\"), Fannie Mae (\"FNMA\") and Freddie Mac (\"FHLMC\") with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In addition to economic and market conditions, our overall management strategy for our investment portfolio is determined by, among other factors, loan demand, deposit mix, liquidity and collateral needs, our interest rate risk position and the overall structure of our balance sheet.\nAvailable for sale securities are reported at fair value and consist of taxable municipal securities, MBSs, and other debt securities. As of December 31, 2016, our available-for-sale investment portfolio consisted of $25.4 million in FNMAs and FHLMC MBSs, $20.0 million of taxable municipal securities, $11.7 million in GNMA MBSs, and $1.0 million of other debt securities.\nHeld-to-maturity securities are carried at book value and consist of taxable municipal securities and MBSs. As of December 31, 2016, we owned $46.0 million in GNMA MBSs, $3.4 million in taxable municipal securities, and $1.9 million in FNMA MBSs that are accounted for as held-to-maturity.\nDuring 2016, total investments decreased $26.3 million or 19.4%. Cash received from sales and paydowns totaled $26.6 million of which $500,000 was deployed to purchase new securities and the remainder was used to fund loan growth.\nDeclines in the fair value of individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities below their cost that are other than temporary would result in permanent write-downs of the individual securities to their fair value. If we do not intend to sell the security prior to recovery and it is more likely than not we will not be required to sell the impaired security prior to recovery, the credit loss portion of the impairment is recognized in earnings and the remaining impairment is recognized in other comprehensive income. Otherwise, the full impairment loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2016, management had the intent and ability to hold impaired securities and no impairment was evaluated as other than temporary. As a result, no other than temporary impairment losses were recognized during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe valuations of investment securities, available-for-sale, at December 31,

The policy is designed to comply with all applicable federal and state regulatory requirements and establishes minimum standards for the extension of credit. The lending policy also provides for pre-determined lending authorities for loan officers commensurate with their abilities and experience. In addition, the policy outlines guidelines for authorities for approval of credit requests at various lending amounts. This includes the Executive Loan Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Credit Officer, and three non-management directors, and the Board of Directors, which reviews the larger requests beyond certain dollar limits and requests that fall under Regulation O. Approval authorities are under regular review and are subject to adjustment. Loan requests outside of standard policy or guidelines may be made on a case by case basis when justified, documented, and approved by the appropriate authority.\nUnderwriting criteria for all types of loans are prescribed within the lending policy. The following is a description of each loan type and related criteria.\nCommercial Real Estate\nCommercial real estate, including acquisition and development, and real estate construction makes up the largest segment of our loan portfolio. This segment is closely monitored at the management and Board level. Our Board of Directors receives reports on a quarterly basis detailing trends.

exceeded the variable rate). Interest rates on these loans will not adjust until the underlying index plus any rate adjuster increases above the floor rate.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans, accruing loans which are past due 90 days or more, repossessed assets, other real estate owned (\"foreclosed assets\"), and certain loans held for sale which are classified as nonperforming. Nonperforming loans are loans that have been placed into nonaccrual status when doubts arise regarding the full collectability of principal or interest and we are therefore uncertain that the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status at the point when the loan becomes past due 90 days unless there is sufficient documentation to establish that the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. These nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status when the factors which initially indicated the doubtful collectability of the loans have ceased to exist. Foreclosed assets consists typically of real estate assets acquired either through foreclosure proceedings or deed in lieu of foreclosure. Foreclosed assets are recorded at an estimated fair value less costs to sell the property, or the recorded investment in the loan at the time of foreclosure, whichever is less. These assets are periodically evaluated and any decreases in the property's fair value result in corresponding write downs of the asset's carrying value.\nAs of December 31, 2016, nonperforming assets declined $2.4 million or 28.2% when compared to December 31, 2015. The Company's ratio of nonperforming assets to regulatory Tier 1 capital plus the allowance has improved during the year. At December 31, 2016, this ratio was 8% compared to 12% at December 31, 2015.\nThe following table describes our nonperforming asset portfolio composition by category based on the loan classifications discussed in Note D - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses to the financial statements for December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td>

at $1.7 million compared to 35 foreclosed properties valued at $1.8 million as of December 31, 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, a significant portion of the $1.7 million value of foreclosed properties was due to the addition of one property in the amount of $863,000 in the first quarter of 2016. The amount of loans transferred into foreclosed assets decreased from $1.2 million for the year ending December 31, 2015 to $1.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. Sales of foreclosed assets decreased to $700,000 in 2016 compared to $3.0 million in 2015 as the number and value of properties in the portfolio continues to decline. The continued decline in foreclosed assets resulted primarily from sales of foreclosed properties and reductions in the number of properties added to foreclosed assets.\nNonaccrual and TDR Loans\nInterest income is calculated by the relevant interest method based upon the daily outstanding balance of the loan. The recognition of interest income ceases however when it becomes probable that full collectability of all interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement may not occur. As a result, loans may either be placed in nonaccrual status and/or restructured to allow for a payment stream which may appropriately accommodate a borrower's diminished repayment capacity. Restructured loans are those for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal have been granted due to the borrower's weakened financial condition. Such restructured loans are typically initially placed into nonaccrual status and may later be returned to accrual status depending upon a demonstrated ability by the borrower to meet the repayment terms of the restructured loan. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied first to principal and thereafter interest only after all principal has been collected. We accrue interest on restructured loans at the restructured rates when we anticipate that no loss of original principal will occur.\nNonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans decreased to 0.85% as of December 31, 2016 compared to 1.44% as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, there were 29 nonaccrual loans totaling $4.3 million compared to 42 loans totaling $6.6 million at December 31, 2015. The gross interest income that would have been recorded for loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $196,000 and $153,000, respectively. These amounts represent interest income that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination, if held for part of the period.\nLoans are classified as a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\") when, for economic or legal reasons which result in a debtor experiencing financial difficulties, the Company grants a concession through a modification of the original loan agreement that would not otherwise be considered. Loans in the process of renewal or modification are reviewed by the Company to determine if the risk grade assigned is accurate based on updated information. The Company's policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a TDR process follows relevant supervisory guidance. If a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is considered and the loan is considered performing. If the borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual and nonperforming until such time as continued performance has been demonstrated, which is typically a period of at least six consecutive payments. If the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were six restructured loans in accrual status compared to eight as of December 31, 2015. Regardless of whether any individual TDR is performing, all TDRs are considered to be impaired and are evaluated as such in the allowance for loan losses calculation. As of December 31, 2016, the recorded investment in performing TDRs and their related allowance for loan losses totaled $1.2 million and $0, respectively, compared to $2.3 million and $328,000 as of December 31, 2015. Outstanding nonperforming TDRs totaled $802,000 with $156,000 in specific reserves as of December 31, 2016 compared to $1.1 million in outstanding nonperforming TDRs with $139,000 in related allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015. The amount of interest recognized for performing and nonperforming TDRs during the twelve months of 2016 was approximately $73,000 and $10,000, respectively.\nThe following table describes performing and nonperforming TDRs for December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performing TDRs:\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial construction and land development\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total performing TDRs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming TDRs:\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial construction and land development\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming TDRs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Summary of Loan Loss Experience\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through periodic charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. Increases to the allowance for loan losses occur as a result of provisions charged to operations and recoveries of amounts previously charged-off, and decreases to the allowance occur when loans are charged-off because management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Management evaluates the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis. The evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves the consideration of loan growth, loan portfolio composition and industry diversification, historical loan loss experience, current delinquency levels, adverse conditions that might affect a borrower's ability to repay the loan, estimated value of underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and all other relevant factors derived from our history of operations. Additionally, regulatory agencies review our allowance for loan losses and may require additional provisions for estimated losses based on judgments that differ from those of management.\nManagement has developed a model for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The model uses the Company's internal grading system to quantify the risk of each loan. The grade is initially assigned by the lending officer and/or the credit administration function. The internal grading system is reviewed and tested periodically by an independent internal loan review function as well as an independent external credit review firm. The testing process involves the evaluation of a sample of new loans, loans having been identified as possessing potential weakness in credit quality, and past due and nonaccrual loans to determine the ongoing effectiveness of the internal grading system. Additionally, regulatory agencies review the adequacy of the risk grades assigned as well as the risk grade process and may require changes based on judgments that differ from those of management that could impact the allowance for loan losses.\nThe grading system is comprised of seven risk categories for active loans. Grades 1 through 4 demonstrate various degrees of risk, but each is considered to have the capacity to perform in accordance with the terms of the loan. Loans possessing a grade of 5 exhibit characteristics which indicate higher risk that the loan may not be able to perform in accordance with the terms of the loan. Grade 6 loans are considered sub-standard and are generally impaired, however, certain of these loans continue to accrue interest, and are not TDRs and are not considered impaired. Grade 7 loans are considered doubtful and would be included in nonaccrual loans. Grade 8 loans are considered uncollectable and identified as a confirmed loss. Loans can also be classified as non-accrual, TDR, or otherwise impaired, all of which are considered impaired and evaluated for specific reserve under FASB Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 310-10 regardless of the risk grade assigned.\nOnce a loan has been determined to meet the definition of impairment, the amount of that impairment is measured through one of two available methods: a calculation of the net present value of the expected future cash flows of the loan discounted by the effective interest rate of the loan or upon the fair market value of the underlying assets securing the loan. If the fair market value of collateral method is selected for use, an updated collateral value is generally obtained based on where the loan is in the collection process and the age of the existing appraisal. Each loan is then analyzed to determine the net value of collateral or cash flows and an estimate of potential loss. The net value of collateral per our analysis is determined using various subjective discounts, selling expenses and a review of the assumptions used to generate the current appraisal. If collection is deemed to be collateral dependent then the deficiency is generally charged off. Appraised values on real estate collateral are subject to constant change and management makes certain assumptions about how the age of an appraisal impacts current value. Impaired loans are re-evaluated periodically to determine the adequacy of specific reserves and charge-offs. Groups of small dollar impaired loans with similar risk characteristics may be evaluated for impairment collectively.\nLoans that are not assessed for specific reserves under FASB ASC 310-10 are reserved for under FASB ASC 450. The loans analyzed under FASB ASC 450 are assigned a reserve based on a quantitative factor and a qualitative factor. The quantitative factor is based on historical charge-off levels and is adjusted for the loan's risk grade. The qualitative factors address loan growth, loan portfolio composition and industry diversification, historical loan loss experience, current delinquency levels, prevailing economic conditions and all other relevant factors derived from our history of operations. Together these two components comprise the ASC 450, or general reserve.\nThe Company utilizes a five year look back period to determine historical loss rates under the quantitative ASC 450 reserve. The Company calculates historical loss rates from the most recent five years on a rolling quarter basis to provide an estimate of potential losses and to provide for the highest base charge-off rate regardless of whether the historical charge-offs are improving or declining. In addition, the Bank assigns a different percentage (\"multiplier\") of the base charge-off rate to the balances for each risk grade within a loan category to reflect the varied risk of charge-off for each. The standard multipliers range from 0% for a risk grade 1 to 300% for a risk grade 6 that is unimpaired. In addition, categories that have a concentrated level of charge-offs associated with a particular risk grade could have an additional reserve factor of 50% to 100% added to that particular risk grade. Lastly, categories that have had historically high charge-offs also have an additional reserve factor between 25% to 100% added to the risk grade 5s and 6s to account for the additional risk in those categories. The reserve amount by risk grade is calculated and then combined for a blended quantitative reserve factor for each loan category.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016 was $9.6 million, which represents 1.9% of total loans outstanding compared to $9.6 million or 2.1% as of December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net loan recoveries were $31,000 compared to $239,000 for the prior year period because the volume of total charge-offs and recoveries continued to decline as asset quality normalizes. Non-accrual loans were $4.3 million and $6.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 30-89 day past due numbers are down to $493,000 as of December 31, 2016 compared to $1.2 million as of December 31, 2015, a 57.9% decrease.\nThe ASC 450 reserve as of December 31, 2015 was 2.2% compared to 1.7% as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $5.1 million in loans in the coastal North Carolina region which are collateralized by properties that have seen significant declines in value since the loans' origination, compared to $6.6 million as of December 31, 2015. Those loans in this category that are evaluated as part of the ASC 450 general reserve are being reserved at an average of 43.8% as of December 31, 2016.\nImpaired loans evaluated for specific reserve as of December 31, 2016 were $5.4 million compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decline of $3.2 million or 37.6%. The ASC 310 reserve was $1.0 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $1.3 million as of December 31, 2015.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of an appropriate amount to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business. While management believes the methodology used to establish the allowance for loan losses incorporates the best information available at the time, future adjustments to the level of the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be adversely affected should circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions initially used. We believe that the allowance for loan losses was established in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles; however, there can be no assurances that the regulatory agencies, after reviewing the loan portfolio, will not require management to increase the level of the allowance. Likewise, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate should there be deterioration in the quality of any loans or changes in any of the factors discussed above. Any increases in the provision for loan losses resulting from such deterioration or change in condition could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table

total of all outstanding loans in each category as a percentage of total loans outstanding.\nDeposits\nDeposits are the primary source of funds for our portfolio loans, loan pipeline and investments. Our deposit strategy is to obtain deposit funds from within our market areas through relationship banking. The majority of our deposits are from individuals and entities located in our primary markets of Johnston and Wake counties. We are positioned to obtain wholesale deposits, including brokered deposits, from various sources in order to supplement our liquidity if needed. As of December 31, 2016, total deposits were approximately $553.5 million, up from $542.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing transaction accounts, which include savings, money market and interest checking, increased $40.0 million or 12.8%. Time deposits declined $28.8 million as we did not replace wholesale time deposits that matured during 2016 and continue to execute a strategy of exiting high cost time deposits for non-relationship customers.\nWholesale deposits, including time deposits placed in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service, (\"CDARS\"), and various brokered deposit programs decreased $17.2 million, or 41.4%, from $41.5 million as of December 31, 2015, to $24.3 million at December 31, 2016 as some brokered deposit maturities were not replaced. The CDARS program provides full FDIC insurance on deposit balances greater than posted FDIC limits by exchanging larger depository relationships with other CDARS members. CDARS is offered as a service to our customers who either require or desire full FDIC insurance coverage of their deposits.\nTime certificates in amounts of $250,000 or more outstanding at December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, by maturity were as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Time Certificates of $250,000 or More by Maturity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over three months through six months\n</td> <td>7,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over six months through twelve months\n</td> <td>3,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over twelve months through three years\n</td> <td>8,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over three years\n</td> <td>5,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings\nThe Bank borrows funds principally from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the \"FHLB\").

These notes are due on November 30, 2025 and the Company is obligated to pay interest at an annualized rate of 6.25% payable in quarterly installments commencing on March 1, 2016. The Company may prepay the notes at any time after November 30, 2020, subject to compliance with applicable law. The proceeds of the offering were used to refinance the Company's then outstanding subordinated promissory notes issued in 2009.\nOn March 30, 2006, $12.4 million of trust preferred securities (the Trust Preferred Securities\u201d) were placed through the Trust. The Trust has invested the net proceeds from the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities in Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the Debentures\u201d) issued by the Company and recorded in borrowings on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Trust Preferred Securities pay cumulative cash distributions quarterly at an annual rate, reset quarterly, equal to three month LIBOR plus 1.35%. The dividends paid to holders of the Trust Preferred Securities, which will be recorded as interest expense, are deductible for income tax purposes. The Trust Preferred Securities are redeemable in whole or in part, on any June 15, September 15, December 15, or March 15. Redemption is mandatory by June 15, 2036.\nThe Bank may purchase federal funds through secured federal funds lines of credit with various banks. These lines are intended for short-term borrowings and are payable on demand and bear interest based upon the daily federal funds rate. For 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Bank purchased no federal funds except in conjunction with semi-annual testing of the borrowing lines available. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank had no federal funds borrowings outstanding under these lines.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOverview\nPre-tax net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $5.3 million compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2015, an increase of $1.8 million or 50%. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $6.9 million, or $1.06 net income per basic and $1.04 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $20.0 million, or $3.12 net income per basic and $3.10 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported an income tax benefit of $1.6 million compared to an income tax benefit of $16.5 million for the same period in 2015. The prior year income tax benefit resulted from the partial reversal of the valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets executed in the second quarter of 2015. The current year income tax benefit was due to the reversal of substantially all of the remaining valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets executed in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet interest income totaled $24.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $22.6 million for the same period in 2015, an increase of $1.8 million or 7.8%. Net interest margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was 3.7% compared to 3.3% for the same period in 2015. The primary driver of the improved margins and overall net interest income was the reduction in funding costs due to the balance sheet strategies executed in late 2015. The 2015 balance sheet strategies included the extinguishment of high-cost long term borrowings and refinancing the Company's subordinated debt at lower rates. Additionally contributing to the increase was additional interest income on loans from the portfolio growth during 2016.\nNon-interest income was $5.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in gains from the sale of problem loans as we completed the previously disclosed Asset Resolution Plan during 2015 and had few loan sales during 2016. Additionally, we completed our exit from the ACH third party payment processor business line in 2015 and indemnification income from this exit was absent from 2016 totals. Other factors contributing to the overall decline were less significant but included reduced premium income from the sale of government guaranteed loans and reductions in service charges on deposit accounts.\nNon-interest expense totaled $24.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $28.6 million for the same period in 2015. As previously mentioned, the Company restructured the balance sheet during the fourth quarter 2015, resulting in the extinguishment of high-cost long term borrowings. The absence of these long term debt extinguishment costs in 2016 was a primary driver in the overall decline of non-interest expense. Another significant contributor included a reduction in salary expense in 2016 as the Company exited certain personnel contracts and incurred related expenses during 2015 as it transitioned the leadership team.\nNet Interest Income\nThe primary component of earnings for the Bank is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income, principally from loan and investment securities, and interest expense, principally on customer deposits and borrowings. Changes in net interest income result from changes in volume, spread and margin. For this purpose, volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as by levels of non-interest-bearing liabilities and capital.\nNet interest income increased by $1.8 million or 7.8%, to $24.4 million in 2016 from $22.6 million in 2015. The net interest margin increased 40 basis points to 3.74% in 2016 from a net interest margin of 3.29% in the previous year. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to declines in interest expense of $2.0 million driven primarily by reductions in high cost long term borrowings that were paid down or refinanced during 2015. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings declined $1.6 million or 51.7% as compared to 2015. Also contributing to the decline in interest expense was the refinancing of the Company's subordinated promissory notes during late 2015 from an interest rate of 8.50% to 6.25%. The reduction in rate and $500,000 reduction in balances resulted in savings of approximately $300,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This improvement in overall net interest income was offset by a reduction in total interest income of $178,000 as overall investment balances and resulting interest income declined and was only partially offset by increases in interest income on loans.\nOn average, our interest-earning assets declined $36.6 million during 2016 from 2015; however, the rate earned on these assets increased 21 basis points. The primary drivers for the decline in interest-earning assets were reductions in interest earning deposits with banks and total investments offset by increases in average loans. Interest earning deposits in banks, which carried a relatively low yield, declined $42.6 million during the year while average investments declined $18.7 million. Part of this decline was from the ACH TPPP business line exit during 2015 which caused us to carry elevated levels of interest bearing deposits during the exit process. This was offset by increases in average loans which grew $25.1 million during 2016. Interest bearing liabilities declined $9.1 million as we remained focus on improving balance sheet efficiency to ensure any unnecessary funding was eliminated. In addition to the total reduction in interest bearing liabilities, the rate paid on these liabilities declined 36 basis points driven primarily by reductions in high cost long term borrowings paid down during 2015.\nWe set interest rates on deposits and loans at competitive rates. Interest rate spreads have increased from 3.0% in 2015 to 3.5% for 2016. The interest rate spread is the difference between the interest rates earned on average loans and investments, and the interest rates paid on average interest-bearing deposits and borrowings.\nThe following schedule presents average balance sheet information for the years 2016, 2015, and 2014, along with related interest earned and average yields for interest-earning assets and the interest paid and average rates for interest-bearing liabilities (amounts in thousands, except for average rates). Nonaccrual notes are included in loan amounts.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and results from management's consideration of such factors as the financial condition of borrowers, past and expected loss experience, current economic conditions, and other factors management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no provision for the allowance for loan looses was recognized in earnings.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $5.8 million, as compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $3.8 million. The principal drivers for the decline are related to non-recurring items that either declined significantly year over year or were absent during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Total gains from problem loan sales were $351,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2015, a $2.9 million decline due to the Company completing disposal of loans identified in the Asset Resolution Plan during 2015. Additionally, the Company exited the ACH third party payment processor business line in 2015 which resulted in a loss of $445,000 on indemnification income from the prior year and also contributed to the decline in other non-interest income. Other less significant factors furthering the decline in non-interest income were reductions in other service charges, commissions and fees largely due to reduced premium income from the sale of government guaranteed loans and reduced insufficient funds charges on deposit accounts.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $24.8 million, as compared to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $3.8 million. The balance sheet strategies executed in 2015 that entailed paying down high cost long term borrowings by $40.0 million led to $2.1 million in related extinguishment costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The absence of this expense in 2016 was a primary driver in the decline in non-interest expense for the twelve month period. During late 2015, the Company also incurred one-time costs associated with changes in three members of the executive management team that contributed to non-recurring salary expenses of $1.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Reductions were seen in almost all other expense categories as we continued reviewing ways to improve efficiency and reduce expenses. These declines were offset by an increase of $282,000 in employee benefits which was primarily due to the absence of a premium holiday by our medical insurance provider and the increase in our 401K plan match during 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported a $1.6 million income tax benefit as compared to a $16.5 million benefit for this same period in 2015. For both periods, the income tax benefit recorded was the result of a reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets net of income tax expense. Since the partial valuation allowance reversal executed in the second quarter of 2015, the Company continued to assess both positive and negative evidence to determine the ability to fully utilize the deferred tax assets prior to its expiration. During the fourth quarter of 2016, based upon the assessment of all positive and negative evidence, we determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character that would fully allow it to utilize the deferred tax assets and reversed substantially all of the remaining valuation allowance.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs part of its normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers, the Bank is at times a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet credit risk. Such instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2016, the Bank's outstanding commitments to extend credit consisted of undisbursed lines of credit, other commitments to extend, undisbursed portion of construction loans and stand-by letters of credit of $136.0 million. See Note L - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding the Bank's off-balance sheet risk exposure.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and in the strength of financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital resources. The term \"liquidity\" refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs for funding loan originations, deposit withdrawals, maturities of borrowings and operating expenses. Management measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off-balance sheet sources of, and demands for, funds on a daily and weekly basis.\nSources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents (net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities), investment securities eligible for pledging to secure borrowings, investments available-for-sale, loan repayments, loan sales, deposits and borrowings from the FHLB secured with pledged loans and securities, and from correspondent banks under overnight federal funds credit lines. During the twelve months ended 2016, the Company's primary use of its excess liquidity was to fund growth in the loan portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2016, our outstanding commitments to extend credit consisted of loan commitments of $21.1 million, undisbursed lines of credit of $97.4 million, unused credit card lines of $16.6 million, financial stand-by letters of credit of $439,000 and performance stand-by letters of credit of $422,000. We believe that our combined aggregate liquidity position from all sources is sufficient to meet the funding requirements of loan demand, and deposit maturities and withdrawals in the near term.\nAt December 31, 2015, our outstanding commitments to extend credit consisted of loan commitments of $29.4 million, undisbursed lines of credit of $94.2 million, unused credit card lines of $16.0 million, financial stand-by letters of credit of $438,000 and performance stand-by letters of credit of $233,000.\nCertificates of deposits represented 36.4% of our total deposits at December 31, 2016, a decrease from 42.4% at December 31, 2015. Brokered and out-of-market certificates of deposit totaled $24.3 million at year-end 2016 and $41.5 million at year-end 2015, which comprised 4.4% and 7.7% of total deposits, respectively. Certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more, inclusive of brokered and out-of-market certificates, represented 5.4% of our total deposits at December 31, 2016 and 6.5% at December 31, 2015. Large certificates of deposits are generally considered rate sensitive. While we will need to pay competitive rates to retain these deposits at their maturities, there are other subjective factors that will determine their continued retention.\nOn August 15, 2014, the Company closed the Rights Offering and Standby Offering with Kenneth R. Lehman, a private investor, who later became a member of our Board of Directors. In connection with the Rights Offering and Standby Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,800,000 shares of its common stock at $5.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $24.0 million.\nManagement believes that the Company's liquidity sources are adequate to meet its operating needs for the next twelve months. Total shareholders' equity was $68.0 million or 9.45% of total assets at December 31, 2016 and $60.4 million or 8.74% of total assets at December 31, 2015. Supplementing customer deposits as a source of funding, we have available lines of credit from various correspondent banks to purchase federal funds on a short-term basis of approximately $37.0 million that remain unused at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has the credit capacity to borrow up to $180.3 million from the FHLB with $70.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2016.\nThe Company had total risk based capital of 15.6%, Tier 1 risk based capital of 12.2%, a leverage ratio of 9.5%, and common equity Tier 1 capital of 10.9% at December 31, 2016, as compared to 16.0%, 12.4%, 8.8%, and 11.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. The Bank had total risk based capital of 15.4%, Tier 1 risk based capital of 14.1%, a leverage ratio of 11.0%, and common equity Tier 1 capital of 14.1% at December 31, 2016, as compared to 15.6%, 14.4%, 10.2%, and 14.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, both the Company and the Bank were well capitalized.\nThe Company sold $11.5 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated promissory notes to certain accredited investors in December 2015. These notes are due on November 30, 2025 and the Company is obligated to pay interest at an annualized rate of 6.25% payable in quarterly installments commencing on March 1, 2016. The Company may prepay the notes at any time after November 30, 2020, subject to compliance with applicable law. The proceeds were used to refinance the Company's then outstanding subordinated promissory notes issued in 2009.\nThe Company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock since it suspended dividends in the fourth quarter of 2010. As a bank holding company, the Company's ability to declare and pay dividends also depends on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. A decision to pay any dividend in the future would be determined based on a number of factors including capital position and capital adequacy, ongoing operations and profitability, the risk profile of the institution and general market conditions, among other things.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increases in the price of goods and services resulting in higher operating expenses. In management's opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. During periods of high inflation, there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply, and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets, loans, and deposits.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note A - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and management's assessment of the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe that the allowance for loan losses, other than temporary impairment of investments available-for-sale, valuation of foreclosed assets, and income taxes, represent particularly sensitive accounting estimates.\nSee Note A - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, and other statements set forth elsewhere in this report, for a comprehensive view of significant accounting estimates and policies.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information about the major components of our results of operations and financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which are contained in this report.\nDescription of Business\nAs a community-focused commercial bank, our primary business consists of providing a full range of banking services to our customers with an emphasis on quality personal service. Our core products consist of loans secured by real estate, commercial and consumer loans, as well as various deposit products to meet our customers' needs. Our primary source of income is generated from net interest margin, the difference between interest income received on our loans and securities and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. Our income is also affected by our ability to price our products competitively and maximize the interest rate spread between the interest yield on loans and securities and the interest rate paid on deposits and borrowings. Our products also generate other income through product related fees and commissions. We incur operating expenses consisting primarily of salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment, technology and other professional and miscellaneous expenses. Refer to Item 1. Business, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of the business.\nRecent Events\nOn March 8, 2017, the Company completed the Reverse Stock Split and the number of authorized shares of common stock was reduced from 80,000,000 to 16,000,000. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and any fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share. All share and share-related information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the decreased number of shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOverview\nTotal assets were $719.9 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $691.4 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $28.5 million or 4.1%. Cash and cash equivalents were $32.6 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $26.8 million at December 31, 2015. The investment portfolio decreased $26.3 million or 19.4% during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016, from $135.6 million at December 31, 2015, to $109.3 million at December 31, 2016. Strong loan demand offset the reductions in the investment portfolio resulting in growth of $48.7 million or 10.6% as outstanding gross loans grew to $507.0 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $458.3 million at December 31, 2015. Investments in life insurance totaled $20.0 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $14.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $5.2 million, which was primarily due to a $5.0 million additional investment in life insurance executed in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal liabilities were $651.9 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $20.9 million or 3.3%, from $631.0 million at December 31, 2015. Total deposits increased $11.2 million or 2.1% during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016, from $542.3 million at December 31, 2015, to $553.5 million at December 31, 2016. Demand, savings, and money market deposit accounts increased $40.0 million or 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaling $352.3 million compared to $312.3 million as of December 31, 2015. This growth was offset by reductions in time deposits of $28.8 million or 12.5%, which totaled $201.3 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $230.1 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term borrowings were $70.0 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $60.0 million at December 31, 2015. Total shareholders' equity increased $7.6 million or 12.6% ending the year at $68.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2016, nonperforming assets had declined $2.4 million or 28.2% when compared to December 31, 2015. The Company's ratio of nonperforming assets to regulatory Tier 1 capital plus the allowance has also improved during the year falling from 12% at December 31, 2015, to 7.9% at December 31, 2016.\nPrior to 2010, for 73 consecutive years, we paid dividends (prior to 1997 when we reorganized into a holding company, it was our wholly-owned subsidiary, Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company, which paid dividends). We suspended dividends in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to losses for the year and continue to monitor our ability to pay dividends based on our risk profile, capital levels, and expected earnings.\nThe following table indicates the ratios for return on average assets and average equity, dividend payout, and average equity to average assets in addition to earnings (loss) per common share and book value per common share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of and for the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Ratios:\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td>0.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.50\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average equity\n</td> <td>10.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.09\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend payout ratio\n</td> <td>0.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average equity to average assets\n</td> <td>8.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.85\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings (Loss) per Common Share(1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic earnings per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book Value per Common Share(1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book value per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Per common share amounts used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share, as well as book value per common share, were adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.\nInvestment Portfolio\nOur investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016 consists of primarily residential mortgage-backed securities (\"MBSs\") and taxable municipal securities. The MBSs consist of fixed-rate mortgage securities underwritten and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae (\"GNMA\"), Fannie Mae (\"FNMA\") and Freddie Mac (\"FHLMC\") with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In addition to economic and market conditions, our overall management strategy for our investment portfolio is determined by, among other factors, loan demand, deposit mix, liquidity and collateral needs, our interest rate risk position and the overall structure of our balance sheet.\nAvailable for sale securities are reported at fair value and consist of taxable municipal securities, MBSs, and other debt securities. As of December 31, 2016, our available-for-sale investment portfolio consisted of $25.4 million in FNMAs and FHLMC MBSs, $20.0 million of taxable municipal securities, $11.7 million in GNMA MBSs, and $1.0 million of other debt securities.\nHeld-to-maturity securities are carried at book value and consist of taxable municipal securities and MBSs. As of December 31, 2016, we owned $46.0 million in GNMA MBSs, $3.4 million in taxable municipal securities, and $1.9 million in FNMA MBSs that are accounted for as held-to-maturity.\nDuring 2016, total investments decreased $26.3 million or 19.4%. Cash received from sales and paydowns totaled $26.6 million of which $500,000 was deployed to purchase new securities and the remainder was used to fund loan growth.\nDeclines in the fair value of individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities below their cost that are other than temporary would result in permanent write-downs of the individual securities to their fair value. If we do not intend to sell the security prior to recovery and it is more likely than not we will not be required to sell the impaired security prior to recovery, the credit loss portion of the impairment is recognized in earnings and the remaining impairment is recognized in other comprehensive income. Otherwise, the full impairment loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2016, management had the intent and ability to hold impaired securities and no impairment was evaluated as other than temporary. As a result, no other than temporary impairment losses were recognized during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe valuations of investment securities, available-for-sale, at December 31,

The lending policy also provides for pre-determined lending authorities for loan officers commensurate with their abilities and experience. In addition, the policy outlines guidelines for authorities for approval of credit requests at various lending amounts. This includes the Executive Loan Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Credit Officer, and three non-management directors, and the Board of Directors, which reviews the larger requests beyond certain dollar limits and requests that fall under Regulation O. Approval authorities are under regular review and are subject to adjustment. Loan requests outside of standard policy or guidelines may be made on a case by case basis when justified, documented, and approved by the appropriate authority.\nUnderwriting criteria for all types of loans are prescribed within the lending policy. The following is a description of each loan type and related criteria.\nCommercial Real Estate\nCommercial real estate, including acquisition and development, and real estate construction makes up the largest segment of our loan portfolio. This segment is closely monitored at the management and Board level. Our Board of Directors receives reports on a quarterly basis detailing trends. Underwriting criteria and procedures for commercial real estate loans generally include:\n \u2022 Procurement of federal income tax returns and financial statements, preferably for the past three years if available, and related supplemental information deemed relevant. \n \u2022 Rent rolls, tenant listings, and other similar documents are requested as needed. \n \u2022 Detailed financial and credit analysis related to cash flow, collateral, the borrower's capital and character, and the operational environment is performed and presented to the appropriate officer or committee for approval. \n \u2022 Cash flows from the project financed and aggregate cash flows of the principals and their entities generally should produce a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.25:1. \n \u2022 Cash or collateral equity injection by the applicant, ranging from 15% to 35% based on regulatory loan to value ratio limits, in order to meet minimum federal guidelines for each loan category. \n \u2022 Past experience of the investor in commercial real estate. \n \u2022 Past experience of the customer with the Bank. \n \u2022 Tangible net worth analysis of the borrower and any guarantors. \n \u2022 General and local commercial real estate conditions are monitored and considered in the decision-making process. \n \u2022 Alternative uses of the security are considered in the event of default. \n \u2022 Credit enhancements are utilized when necessary and desirable, such as the use of guarantors and take out commitments. \n \u2022 Non-construction real estate loans typically have a 15 to 20 year amortization with a five or seven year balloon payment. If appropriate, a loan may be set up as an interest only single payment if the identified repayment source coincides with the maturity. \n \u2022 Commercial construction projects generally require that an engineer or architect review the applicant's cost figures for accuracy. In addition, all draw requests must be approved by either the engineer or architect for accuracy before payment is made. \n \u2022 On-site progress inspections are completed to protect the Bank. \n \u2022 Requests for residential construction loans are closely monitored at the contractor level and subdivision level for concentrations. A request is generally denied if either the predetermined builder's concentration or Bank's concentration limit has been attained. \n \u2022 Real estate construction loans are made for terms not to exceed 12 to 18 months for residential construction and 18 to 24 months for commercial construction. \n \u2022 Collateral is investigated using current valuations and is supplemented by the loan officer's knowledge of the local market. Outside appraisals are completed by appraisers on the Bank's approved list. The appraisals on loans greater than $250,000 are reviewed to ensure they are compliant with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. \nResidential Real Estate\nResidential real estate makes up the second largest segment of our loan portfolio and outstanding balances have generally been very stable, as a percentage of loans outstanding. Terms generally range up to 15 years with amortizations of up to 30 years. Underwriting criteria and procedures for residential real estate mortgage loans generally include:\n \u2022 Monthly debt payments of the borrower to gross monthly income should not exceed 45% with stable employment of two years. \n \u2022 Loan to value ratio limits of up to 90% of the appraised value. \n \u2022 A credit investigation, which includes an Equifax credit report with a Beacon score of at least 620. \n \u2022 Verification of income by various methods. \n \u2022 Appropriate insurance to protect the Bank, typically in the amount of the loan. \n \u2022 Flood certifications are procured. \n \u2022 Collateral is investigated using current valuations and is supplemented by the loan officer's knowledge of the local market. Outside appraisals are completed by appraisers on the Bank's approved list. The appraisals on loans greater than $250,000 are reviewed to ensure they are compliant with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. \nFinancial\nFinancial loans are secured by stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Underwriting procedures and criteria for financial loans generally include:\n \u2022 Stock loans should be structured to coincide with the identified source of repayment. \n \u2022 The maximum loan to value ratio for stock listed for sale on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ is 85% of its market value. \n \u2022 Generally, stock loans should not exceed 60 months. \nAgricultural\nCrop production lending presents many risks to the lender because of weather uncertainty and fluctuations in commodity prices. Underwriting procedures and criteria for agricultural loans generally include:\n \u2022 The farmer should have the financial capacity to withstand at least one bad crop year. \n \u2022 The farmer must possess sufficient equity in equipment or farmland for the Bank to term, within acceptable collateral margins (ranging from 50% to 80%) and cash flow debt service coverage requirements (generally 1.25:1), any line outstanding after the sale of crops. \n \u2022 Farmers should meet certain qualitative criteria with respect to the farmer's knowledge and experience. \n \u2022 For new customers, documentation on where the farmer previously banked and the circumstances underlying the new loan request. \nCommercial Inventory and Accounts Receivable\nUnderwriting procedures and loan to value ratios for commercial inventory loans and accounts receivable loans generally include:\n \u2022 Up to 80% of eligible accounts receivable. \n \u2022 Up to 80% of the individually assigned accounts receivable. The customer assigns individual invoices, sometimes with shipping documents attached. These may be stamped or marked to show that they have been assigned to the Bank. The customer brings payments to the Bank for processing against individual invoices. \n \u2022 50% or less of the cost or market on materials and qualified finished goods, depending on their quality and stability. \n \u2022 0% on work-in-progress. \nInstallment Loans\nThese loans are predominantly direct loans to established customers of the Bank and primarily include the financing of automobiles, boats, and other consumer goods. The character, capacity, collateral, and conditions are evaluated using policy limitations. Installment loans are typically made for terms that do not exceed 60 months with any exceptions being documented. Installment loan underwriting criteria and procedures for such financing generally include:\n \u2022 Financial statements are generally required on all consumer loans secured by a primary residence, all unsecured loans of $10,000 or more, and all secured transactions of $50,000 or more. \n \u2022 Income verification is generally required on all consumer loans. \n \u2022 Past experience of the customer with the Bank. \n \u2022 A debt to income ratio that does not exceed 45%. \n \u2022 Stable employment record of two years. \n \u2022 Stable residency record of two years. \n \u2022 A Beacon score of at least 620. \n \u2022 Terms to match the usefulness or life of the security. \n \u2022 If unsecured, the total unsecured loans of the applicant should not exceed 15% of adjusted net worth or 20% of the applicant's gross annual income. \nInterest Only Loans\nInterest only loans are generally limited to construction lending, properties recently completed and undergoing occupancy stabilization period, and revolving lines of credit. Any other loans made as interest only should have a reason and proper approval.\nBank policy generally prohibits underwriting negative amortization loans or hybrid loans.\nThe following loan table

exceeded the variable rate). Interest rates on these loans will not adjust until the underlying index plus any rate adjuster increases above the floor rate.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans, accruing loans which are past due 90 days or more, repossessed assets, other real estate owned (\"foreclosed assets\"), and certain loans held for sale which are classified as nonperforming. Nonperforming loans are loans that have been placed into nonaccrual status when doubts arise regarding the full collectability of principal or interest and we are therefore uncertain that the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status at the point when the loan becomes past due 90 days unless there is sufficient documentation to establish that the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. These nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status when the factors which initially indicated the doubtful collectability of the loans have ceased to exist. Foreclosed assets consists typically of real estate assets acquired either through foreclosure proceedings or deed in lieu of foreclosure. Foreclosed assets are recorded at an estimated fair value less costs to sell the property, or the recorded investment in the loan at the time of foreclosure, whichever is less. These assets are periodically evaluated and any decreases in the property's fair value result in corresponding write downs of the asset's carrying value.\nAs of December 31, 2016, nonperforming assets declined $2.4 million or 28.2% when compared to December 31, 2015. The Company's ratio of nonperforming assets to regulatory Tier 1 capital plus the allowance has improved during the year. At December 31, 2016, this ratio was 8% compared to 12% at December 31, 2015.\nThe following table describes our nonperforming asset portfolio composition by category based on the loan classifications

at $1.7 million compared to 35 foreclosed properties valued at $1.8 million as of December 31, 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, a significant portion of the $1.7 million value of foreclosed properties was due to the addition of one property in the amount of $863,000 in the first quarter of 2016. The amount of loans transferred into foreclosed assets decreased from $1.2 million for the year ending December 31, 2015 to $1.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. Sales of foreclosed assets decreased to $700,000 in 2016 compared to $3.0 million in 2015 as the number and value of properties in the portfolio continues to decline. The continued decline in foreclosed assets resulted primarily from sales of foreclosed properties and reductions in the number of properties added to foreclosed assets.\nNonaccrual and TDR Loans\nInterest income is calculated by the relevant interest method based upon the daily outstanding balance of the loan. The recognition of interest income ceases however when it becomes probable that full collectability of all interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement may not occur. As a result, loans may either be placed in nonaccrual status and/or restructured to allow for a payment stream which may appropriately accommodate a borrower's diminished repayment capacity. Restructured loans are those for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal have been granted due to the borrower's weakened financial condition. Such restructured loans are typically initially placed into nonaccrual status and may later be returned to accrual status depending upon a demonstrated ability by the borrower to meet the repayment terms of the restructured loan. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied first to principal and thereafter interest only after all principal has been collected. We accrue interest on restructured loans at the restructured rates when we anticipate that no loss of original principal will occur.\nNonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans decreased to 0.85% as of December 31, 2016 compared to 1.44% as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, there were 29 nonaccrual loans totaling $4.3 million compared to 42 loans totaling $6.6 million at December 31, 2015. The gross interest income that would have been recorded for loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $196,000 and $153,000, respectively. These amounts represent interest income that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination, if held for part of the period.\nLoans are classified as a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\") when, for economic or legal reasons which result in a debtor experiencing financial difficulties, the Company grants a concession through a modification of the original loan agreement that would not otherwise be considered. Loans in the process of renewal or modification are reviewed by the Company to determine if the risk grade assigned is accurate based on updated information. The Company's policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a TDR process follows relevant supervisory guidance. If a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is considered and the loan is considered performing. If the borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual and nonperforming until such time as continued performance has been demonstrated, which is typically a period of at least six consecutive payments. If the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were six restructured loans in accrual status compared to eight as of December 31, 2015. Regardless of whether any individual TDR is performing, all TDRs are considered to be impaired and are evaluated as such in the allowance for loan losses calculation. As of December 31, 2016, the recorded investment in performing TDRs and their related allowance for loan losses totaled $1.2 million and $0, respectively, compared to $2.3 million and $328,000 as of December 31, 2015. Outstanding nonperforming TDRs totaled $802,000 with $156,000 in specific reserves as of December 31, 2016 compared to $1.1 million in outstanding nonperforming TDRs with $139,000 in related allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015. The amount of interest recognized for performing and nonperforming TDRs during the twelve months of 2016 was approximately $73,000 and $10,000, respectively.\nThe following table describes performing and nonperforming TDRs for December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performing TDRs:\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial construction and land development\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total performing TDRs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming TDRs:\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial construction and land development\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming TDRs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Summary of Loan Loss Experience\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through periodic charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. Increases to the allowance for loan losses occur as a result of provisions charged to operations and recoveries of amounts previously charged-off, and decreases to the allowance occur when loans are charged-off because management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Management evaluates the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis. The evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves the consideration of loan growth, loan portfolio composition and industry diversification, historical loan loss experience, current delinquency levels, adverse conditions that might affect a borrower's ability to repay the loan, estimated value of underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and all other relevant factors derived from our history of operations. Additionally, regulatory agencies review our allowance for loan losses and may require additional provisions for estimated losses based on judgments that differ from those of management.\nManagement has developed a model for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The model uses the Company's internal grading system to quantify the risk of each loan. The grade is initially assigned by the lending officer and/or the credit administration function. The internal grading system is reviewed and tested periodically by an independent internal loan review function as well as an independent external credit review firm. The testing process involves the evaluation of a sample of new loans, loans having been identified as possessing potential weakness in credit quality, and past due and nonaccrual loans to determine the ongoing effectiveness of the internal grading system. Additionally, regulatory agencies review the adequacy of the risk grades assigned as well as the risk grade process and may require changes based on judgments that differ from those of management that could impact the allowance for loan losses.\nThe grading system is comprised of seven risk categories for active loans. Grades 1 through 4 demonstrate various degrees of risk, but each is considered to have the capacity to perform in accordance with the terms of the loan. Loans possessing a grade of 5 exhibit characteristics which indicate higher risk that the loan may not be able to perform in accordance with the terms of the loan. Grade 6 loans are considered sub-standard and are generally impaired, however, certain of these loans continue to accrue interest, and are not TDRs and are not considered impaired. Grade 7 loans are considered doubtful and would be included in nonaccrual loans. Grade 8 loans are considered uncollectable and identified as a confirmed loss. Loans can also be classified as non-accrual, TDR, or otherwise impaired, all of which are considered impaired and evaluated for specific reserve under FASB Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 310-10 regardless of the risk grade assigned.\nOnce a loan has been determined to meet the definition of impairment, the amount of that impairment is measured through one of two available methods: a calculation of the net present value of the expected future cash flows of the loan discounted by the effective interest rate of the loan or upon the fair market value of the underlying assets securing the loan. If the fair market value of collateral method is selected for use, an updated collateral value is generally obtained based on where the loan is in the collection process and the age of the existing appraisal. Each loan is then analyzed to determine the net value of collateral or cash flows and an estimate of potential loss. The net value of collateral per our analysis is determined using various subjective discounts, selling expenses and a review of the assumptions used to generate the current appraisal. If collection is deemed to be collateral dependent then the deficiency is generally charged off. Appraised values on real estate collateral are subject to constant change and management makes certain assumptions about how the age of an appraisal impacts current value. Impaired loans are re-evaluated periodically to determine the adequacy of specific reserves and charge-offs. Groups of small dollar impaired loans with similar risk characteristics may be evaluated for impairment collectively.\nLoans that are not assessed for specific reserves under FASB ASC 310-10 are reserved for under FASB ASC 450. The loans analyzed under FASB ASC 450 are assigned a reserve based on a quantitative factor and a qualitative factor. The quantitative factor is based on historical charge-off levels and is adjusted for the loan's risk grade. The qualitative factors address loan growth, loan portfolio composition and industry diversification, historical loan loss experience, current delinquency levels, prevailing economic conditions and all other relevant factors derived from our history of operations. Together these two components comprise the ASC 450, or general reserve.\nThe Company utilizes a five year look back period to determine historical loss rates under the quantitative ASC 450 reserve. The Company calculates historical loss rates from the most recent five years on a rolling quarter basis to provide an estimate of potential losses and to provide for the highest base charge-off rate regardless of whether the historical charge-offs are improving or declining. In addition, the Bank assigns a different percentage (\"multiplier\") of the base charge-off rate to the balances for each risk grade within a loan category to reflect the varied risk of charge-off for each. The standard multipliers range from 0% for a risk grade 1 to 300% for a risk grade 6 that is unimpaired. In addition, categories that have a concentrated level of charge-offs associated with a particular risk grade could have an additional reserve factor of 50% to 100% added to that particular risk grade. Lastly, categories that have had historically high charge-offs also have an additional reserve factor between 25% to 100% added to the risk grade 5s and 6s to account for the additional risk in those categories. The reserve amount by risk grade is calculated and then combined for a blended quantitative reserve factor for each loan category.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016 was $9.6 million, which represents 1.9% of total loans outstanding compared to $9.6 million or 2.1% as of December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net loan recoveries were $31,000 compared to $239,000 for the prior year period because the volume of total charge-offs and recoveries continued to decline as asset quality normalizes. Non-accrual loans were $4.3 million and $6.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 30-89 day past due numbers are down to $493,000 as of December 31, 2016 compared to $1.2 million as of December 31, 2015, a 57.9% decrease.\nThe ASC 450 reserve as of December 31, 2015 was 2.2% compared to 1.7% as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $5.1 million in loans in the coastal North Carolina region which are collateralized by properties that have seen significant declines in value since the loans' origination, compared to $6.6 million as of December 31, 2015. Those loans in this category that are evaluated as part of the ASC 450 general reserve are being reserved at an average of 43.8% as of December 31, 2016.\nImpaired loans evaluated for specific reserve as of December 31, 2016 were $5.4 million compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decline of $3.2 million or 37.6%. The ASC 310 reserve was $1.0 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $1.3 million as of December 31, 2015.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of an appropriate amount to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business. While management believes the methodology used to establish the allowance for loan losses incorporates the best information available at the time, future adjustments to the level of the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be adversely affected should circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions initially used. We believe that the allowance for loan losses was established in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles; however, there can be no assurances that the regulatory agencies, after reviewing the loan portfolio, will not require management to increase the level of the allowance. Likewise, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate should there be deterioration in the quality of any loans or changes in any of the factors discussed above. Any increases in the provision for loan losses resulting from such deterioration or change in condition could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table

The majority of our deposits are from individuals and entities located in our primary markets of Johnston and Wake counties. We are positioned to obtain wholesale deposits, including brokered deposits, from various sources in order to supplement our liquidity if needed. As of December 31, 2016, total deposits were approximately $553.5 million, up from $542.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing transaction accounts, which include savings, money market and interest checking, increased $40.0 million or 12.8%. Time deposits declined $28.8 million as we did not replace wholesale time deposits that matured during 2016 and continue to execute a strategy of exiting high cost time deposits for non-relationship customers.\nWholesale deposits, including time deposits placed in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service, (\"CDARS\"), and various brokered deposit programs decreased $17.2 million, or 41.4%, from $41.5 million as of December 31, 2015, to $24.3 million at December 31, 2016 as some brokered deposit maturities were not replaced. The CDARS program provides full FDIC insurance on deposit balances greater than posted FDIC limits by exchanging larger depository relationships with other CDARS members.

The dividends paid to holders of the Trust Preferred Securities, which will be recorded as interest expense, are deductible for income tax purposes. The Trust Preferred Securities are redeemable in whole or in part, on any June 15, September 15, December 15, or March 15. Redemption is mandatory by June 15, 2036.\nThe Bank may purchase federal funds through secured federal funds lines of credit with various banks. These lines are intended for short-term borrowings and are payable on demand and bear interest based upon the daily federal funds rate. For 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Bank purchased no federal funds except in conjunction with semi-annual testing of the borrowing lines available. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank had no federal funds borrowings outstanding under these lines.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOverview\nPre-tax net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $5.3 million compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2015, an increase of $1.8 million or 50%. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $6.9 million, or $1.06 net income per basic and $1.04 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $20.0 million, or $3.12 net income per basic and $3.10 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported an income tax benefit of $1.6 million compared to an income tax benefit of $16.5 million for the same period in 2015. The prior year income tax benefit resulted from the partial reversal of the valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets executed in the second quarter of 2015. The current year income tax benefit was due to the reversal of substantially all of the remaining valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets executed in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet interest income totaled $24.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $22.6 million for the same period in 2015, an increase of $1.8 million or 7.8%. Net interest margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was 3.7% compared to 3.3% for the same period in 2015. The primary driver of the improved margins and overall net interest income was the reduction in funding costs due to the balance sheet strategies executed in late 2015. The 2015 balance sheet strategies included the extinguishment of high-cost long term borrowings and refinancing the Company's subordinated debt at lower rates. Additionally contributing to the increase was additional interest income on loans from the portfolio growth during 2016.\nNon-interest income was $5.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in gains from the sale of problem loans as we completed the previously disclosed Asset Resolution Plan during 2015 and had few loan sales during 2016. Additionally, we completed our exit from the ACH third party payment processor business line in 2015 and indemnification income from this exit was absent from 2016 totals. Other factors contributing to the overall decline were less significant but included reduced premium income from the sale of government guaranteed loans and reductions in service charges on deposit accounts.\nNon-interest expense totaled $24.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $28.6 million for the same period in 2015. As previously mentioned, the Company restructured the balance sheet during the fourth quarter 2015, resulting in the extinguishment of high-cost long term borrowings. The absence of these long term debt extinguishment costs in 2016 was a primary driver in the overall decline of non-interest expense. Another significant contributor included a reduction in salary expense in 2016 as the Company exited certain personnel contracts and incurred related expenses during 2015 as it transitioned the leadership team.\nNet Interest Income\nThe primary component of earnings for the Bank is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income, principally from loan and investment securities, and interest expense, principally on customer deposits and borrowings. Changes in net interest income result from changes in volume, spread and margin. For this purpose, volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as by levels of non-interest-bearing liabilities and capital.\nNet interest income increased by $1.8 million or 7.8%, to $24.4 million in 2016 from $22.6 million in 2015. The net interest margin increased 40 basis points to 3.74% in 2016 from a net interest margin of 3.29% in the previous year. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to declines in interest expense of $2.0 million driven primarily by reductions in high cost long term borrowings that were paid down or refinanced during 2015. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings declined $1.6 million or 51.7% as compared to 2015. Also contributing to the decline in interest expense was the refinancing of the Company's subordinated promissory notes during late 2015 from an interest rate of 8.50% to 6.25%. The reduction in rate and $500,000 reduction in balances resulted in savings of approximately $300,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This improvement in overall net interest income was offset by a reduction in total interest income of $178,000 as overall investment balances and resulting interest income declined and was only partially offset by increases in interest income on loans.\nOn average, our interest-earning assets declined $36.6 million during 2016 from 2015; however, the rate earned on these assets increased 21 basis points. The primary drivers for the decline in interest-earning assets were reductions in interest earning deposits with banks and total investments offset by increases in average loans. Interest earning deposits in banks, which carried a relatively low yield, declined $42.6 million during the year while average investments declined $18.7 million. Part of this decline was from the ACH TPPP business line exit during 2015 which caused us to carry elevated levels of interest bearing deposits during the exit process. This was offset by increases in average loans which grew $25.1 million during 2016. Interest bearing liabilities declined $9.1 million as we remained focus on improving balance sheet efficiency to ensure any unnecessary funding was eliminated. In addition to the total reduction in interest bearing liabilities, the rate paid on these liabilities declined 36 basis points driven primarily by reductions in high cost long term borrowings paid down during 2015.\nWe set interest rates on deposits and loans at competitive rates. Interest rate spreads have increased from 3.0% in 2015 to 3.5% for 2016. The interest rate spread is the difference between the interest rates earned on average loans and investments, and the interest rates paid on average interest-bearing deposits and borrowings.\nThe following schedule presents average balance sheet information for the years 2016, 2015, and 2014, along with related interest earned and average yields for interest-earning assets and the interest paid and average rates for interest-bearing liabilities (amounts in thousands, except for average rates). Nonaccrual notes are included in loan amounts.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and results from management's consideration of such factors as the financial condition of borrowers, past and expected loss experience, current economic conditions, and other factors management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no provision for the allowance for loan looses was recognized in earnings.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $5.8 million, as compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $3.8 million. The principal drivers for the decline are related to non-recurring items that either declined significantly year over year or were absent during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Total gains from problem loan sales were $351,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2015, a $2.9 million decline due to the Company completing disposal of loans identified in the Asset Resolution Plan during 2015. Additionally, the Company exited the ACH third party payment processor business line in 2015 which resulted in a loss of $445,000 on indemnification income from the prior year and also contributed to the decline in other non-interest income. Other less significant factors furthering the decline in non-interest income were reductions in other service charges, commissions and fees largely due to reduced premium income from the sale of government guaranteed loans and reduced insufficient funds charges on deposit accounts.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $24.8 million, as compared to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $3.8 million. The balance sheet strategies executed in 2015 that entailed paying down high cost long term borrowings by $40.0 million led to $2.1 million in related extinguishment costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The absence of this expense in 2016 was a primary driver in the decline in non-interest expense for the twelve month period. During late 2015, the Company also incurred one-time costs associated with changes in three members of the executive management team that contributed to non-recurring salary expenses of $1.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Reductions were seen in almost all other expense categories as we continued reviewing ways to improve efficiency and reduce expenses. These declines were offset by an increase of $282,000 in employee benefits which was primarily due to the absence of a premium holiday by our medical insurance provider and the increase in our 401K plan match during 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported a $1.6 million income tax benefit as compared to a $16.5 million benefit for this same period in 2015. For both periods, the income tax benefit recorded was the result of a reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets net of income tax expense. Since the partial valuation allowance reversal executed in the second quarter of 2015, the Company continued to assess both positive and negative evidence to determine the ability to fully utilize the deferred tax assets prior to its expiration. During the fourth quarter of 2016, based upon the assessment of all positive and negative evidence, we determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character that would fully allow it to utilize the deferred tax assets and reversed substantially all of the remaining valuation allowance.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs part of its normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers, the Bank is at times a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet credit risk. Such instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2016, the Bank's outstanding commitments to extend credit consisted of undisbursed lines of credit, other commitments to extend, undisbursed portion of construction loans and stand-by letters of credit of $136.0 million. See Note L - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding the Bank's off-balance sheet risk exposure.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and in the strength of financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital resources. The term \"liquidity\" refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs for funding loan originations, deposit withdrawals, maturities of borrowings and operating expenses. Management measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off-balance sheet sources of, and demands for, funds on a daily and weekly basis.\nSources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents (net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities), investment securities eligible for pledging to secure borrowings, investments available-for-sale, loan repayments, loan sales, deposits and borrowings from the FHLB secured with pledged loans and securities, and from correspondent banks under overnight federal funds credit lines. During the twelve months ended 2016, the Company's primary use of its excess liquidity was to fund growth in the loan portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2016, our outstanding commitments to extend credit consisted of loan commitments of $21.1 million, undisbursed lines of credit of $97.4 million, unused credit card lines of $16.6 million, financial stand-by letters of credit of $439,000 and performance stand-by letters of credit of $422,000. We believe that our combined aggregate liquidity position from all sources is sufficient to meet the funding requirements of loan demand, and deposit maturities and withdrawals in the near term.\nAt December 31, 2015, our outstanding commitments to extend credit consisted of loan commitments of $29.4 million, undisbursed lines of credit of $94.2 million, unused credit card lines of $16.0 million, financial stand-by letters of credit of $438,000 and performance stand-by letters of credit of $233,000.\nCertificates of deposits represented 36.4% of our total deposits at December 31, 2016, a decrease from 42.4% at December 31, 2015. Brokered and out-of-market certificates of deposit totaled $24.3 million at year-end 2016 and $41.5 million at year-end 2015, which comprised 4.4% and 7.7% of total deposits, respectively. Certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more, inclusive of brokered and out-of-market certificates, represented 5.4% of our total deposits at December 31, 2016 and 6.5% at December 31, 2015. Large certificates of deposits are generally considered rate sensitive. While we will need to pay competitive rates to retain these deposits at their maturities, there are other subjective factors that will determine their continued retention.\nOn August 15, 2014, the Company closed the Rights Offering and Standby Offering with Kenneth R. Lehman, a private investor, who later became a member of our Board of Directors. In connection with the Rights Offering and Standby Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,800,000 shares of its common stock at $5.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $24.0 million.\nManagement believes that the Company's liquidity sources are adequate to meet its operating needs for the next twelve months. Total shareholders' equity was $68.0 million or 9.45% of total assets at December 31, 2016 and $60.4 million or 8.74% of total assets at December 31, 2015. Supplementing customer deposits as a source of funding, we have available lines of credit from various correspondent banks to purchase federal funds on a short-term basis of approximately $37.0 million that remain unused at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has the credit capacity to borrow up to $180.3 million from the FHLB with $70.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2016.\nThe Company had total risk based capital of 15.6%, Tier 1 risk based capital of 12.2%, a leverage ratio of 9.5%, and common equity Tier 1 capital of 10.9% at December 31, 2016, as compared to 16.0%, 12.4%, 8.8%, and 11.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. The Bank had total risk based capital of 15.4%, Tier 1 risk based capital of 14.1%, a leverage ratio of 11.0%, and common equity Tier 1 capital of 14.1% at December 31, 2016, as compared to 15.6%, 14.4%, 10.2%, and 14.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, both the Company and the Bank were well capitalized.\nThe Company sold $11.5 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated promissory notes to certain accredited investors in December 2015. These notes are due on November 30, 2025 and the Company is obligated to pay interest at an annualized rate of 6.25% payable in quarterly installments commencing on March 1, 2016. The Company may prepay the notes at any time after November 30, 2020, subject to compliance with applicable law. The proceeds were used to refinance the Company's then outstanding subordinated promissory notes issued in 2009.\nThe Company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock since it suspended dividends in the fourth quarter of 2010. As a bank holding company, the Company's ability to declare and pay dividends also depends on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. A decision to pay any dividend in the future would be determined based on a number of factors including capital position and capital adequacy, ongoing operations and profitability, the risk profile of the institution and general market conditions, among other things.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increases in the price of goods and services resulting in higher operating expenses. In management's opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. During periods of high inflation, there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply, and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets, loans, and deposits.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note A - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and management's assessment of the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe that the allowance for loan losses, other than temporary impairment of investments available-for-sale, valuation of foreclosed assets, and income taxes, represent particularly sensitive accounting estimates.\nSee Note A - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, and other statements set forth elsewhere in this report, for a comprehensive view of significant accounting estimates and policies.", "item_7_text": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information about the major components of our results of operations and financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which are contained in this report.\nDescription of Business\nAs a community-focused commercial bank, our primary business consists of providing a full range of banking services to our customers with an emphasis on quality personal service. Our core products consist of loans secured by real estate, commercial and consumer loans, as well as various deposit products to meet our customers' needs. Our primary source of income is generated from net interest margin, the difference between interest income received on our loans and securities and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. Our income is also affected by our ability to price our products competitively and maximize the interest rate spread between the interest yield on loans and securities and the interest rate paid on deposits and borrowings. Our products also generate other income through product related fees and commissions. We incur operating expenses consisting primarily of salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment, technology and other professional and miscellaneous expenses. Refer to Item 1. Business, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of the business.\nRecent Events\nOn March 8, 2017, the Company completed the Reverse Stock Split and the number of authorized shares of common stock was reduced from 80,000,000 to 16,000,000. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and any fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share. All share and share-related information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the decreased number of shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOverview\nTotal assets were $719.9 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $691.4 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $28.5 million or 4.1%. Cash and cash equivalents were $32.6 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $26.8 million at December 31, 2015. The investment portfolio decreased $26.3 million or 19.4% during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016, from $135.6 million at December 31, 2015, to $109.3 million at December 31, 2016. Strong loan demand offset the reductions in the investment portfolio resulting in growth of $48.7 million or 10.6% as outstanding gross loans grew to $507.0 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $458.3 million at December 31, 2015. Investments in life insurance totaled $20.0 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $14.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $5.2 million, which was primarily due to a $5.0 million additional investment in life insurance executed in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal liabilities were $651.9 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $20.9 million or 3.3%, from $631.0 million at December 31, 2015. Total deposits increased $11.2 million or 2.1% during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016, from $542.3 million at December 31, 2015, to $553.5 million at December 31, 2016. Demand, savings, and money market deposit accounts increased $40.0 million or 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaling $352.3 million compared to $312.3 million as of December 31, 2015. This growth was offset by reductions in time deposits of $28.8 million or 12.5%, which totaled $201.3 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $230.1 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term borrowings were $70.0 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $60.0 million at December 31, 2015. Total shareholders' equity increased $7.6 million or 12.6% ending the year at $68.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2016, nonperforming assets had declined $2.4 million or 28.2% when compared to December 31, 2015. The Company's ratio of nonperforming assets to regulatory Tier 1 capital plus the allowance has also improved during the year falling from 12% at December 31, 2015, to 7.9% at December 31, 2016.\nPrior to 2010, for 73 consecutive years, we paid dividends (prior to 1997 when we reorganized into a holding company, it was our wholly-owned subsidiary, Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company, which paid dividends). We suspended dividends in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to losses for the year and continue to monitor our ability to pay dividends based on our risk profile, capital levels, and expected earnings.\nThe following table indicates the ratios for return on average assets and average equity, dividend payout, and average equity to average assets in addition to earnings (loss) per common share and book value per common share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n\n(1) Per common share amounts used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share, as well as book value per common share, were adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.\nInvestment Portfolio\nOur investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016 consists of primarily residential mortgage-backed securities (\"MBSs\") and taxable municipal securities. The MBSs consist of fixed-rate mortgage securities underwritten and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae (\"GNMA\"), Fannie Mae (\"FNMA\") and Freddie Mac (\"FHLMC\") with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In addition to economic and market conditions, our overall management strategy for our investment portfolio is determined by, among other factors, loan demand, deposit mix, liquidity and collateral needs, our interest rate risk position and the overall structure of our balance sheet.\nAvailable for sale securities are reported at fair value and consist of taxable municipal securities, MBSs, and other debt securities. As of December 31, 2016, our available-for-sale investment portfolio consisted of $25.4 million in FNMAs and FHLMC MBSs, $20.0 million of taxable municipal securities, $11.7 million in GNMA MBSs, and $1.0 million of other debt securities.\nHeld-to-maturity securities are carried at book value and consist of taxable municipal securities and MBSs. As of December 31, 2016, we owned $46.0 million in GNMA MBSs, $3.4 million in taxable municipal securities, and $1.9 million in FNMA MBSs that are accounted for as held-to-maturity.\nDuring 2016, total investments decreased $26.3 million or 19.4%. Cash received from sales and paydowns totaled $26.6 million of which $500,000 was deployed to purchase new securities and the remainder was used to fund loan growth.\nDeclines in the fair value of individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities below their cost that are other than temporary would result in permanent write-downs of the individual securities to their fair value. If we do not intend to sell the security prior to recovery and it is more likely than not we will not be required to sell the impaired security prior to recovery, the credit loss portion of the impairment is recognized in earnings and the remaining impairment is recognized in other comprehensive income. Otherwise, the full impairment loss is recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2016, management had the intent and ability to hold impaired securities and no impairment was evaluated as other than temporary. As a result, no other than temporary impairment losses were recognized during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe valuations of investment securities, available-for-sale, at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe valuations of investment securities, held-to-maturity, at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe following table sets forth the carrying value of our available-for-sale investment portfolio at December 31, 2016 by expected maturities (amounts in thousands). Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\n\nThe following table sets forth the weighted average yield (computed on a tax equivalent basis) by maturity of our available-for-sale investment portfolio at December 31, 2016 amortized cost:\n\nThe following table sets forth the carrying value of our held-to-maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2016 by expected maturities (amounts in thousands). Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\n\nThe following table sets forth the weighted average yield (computed on a tax equivalent basis) by maturity of our held-to-maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2016 amortized cost:\n\nLoan Portfolio\nWe have a loan policy in place that relates to loan administration, documentation, underwriting, approval, and reporting requirements for various types of loans. The policy is designed to comply with all applicable federal and state regulatory requirements and establishes minimum standards for the extension of credit. The lending policy also provides for pre-determined lending authorities for loan officers commensurate with their abilities and experience. In addition, the policy outlines guidelines for authorities for approval of credit requests at various lending amounts. This includes the Executive Loan Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Credit Officer, and three non-management directors, and the Board of Directors, which reviews the larger requests beyond certain dollar limits and requests that fall under Regulation O. Approval authorities are under regular review and are subject to adjustment. Loan requests outside of standard policy or guidelines may be made on a case by case basis when justified, documented, and approved by the appropriate authority.\nUnderwriting criteria for all types of loans are prescribed within the lending policy. The following is a description of each loan type and related criteria.\nCommercial Real Estate\nCommercial real estate, including acquisition and development, and real estate construction makes up the largest segment of our loan portfolio. This segment is closely monitored at the management and Board level. Our Board of Directors receives reports on a quarterly basis detailing trends. Underwriting criteria and procedures for commercial real estate loans generally include:\n \u2022 Procurement of federal income tax returns and financial statements, preferably for the past three years if available, and related supplemental information deemed relevant. \n \u2022 Rent rolls, tenant listings, and other similar documents are requested as needed. \n \u2022 Detailed financial and credit analysis related to cash flow, collateral, the borrower's capital and character, and the operational environment is performed and presented to the appropriate officer or committee for approval. \n \u2022 Cash flows from the project financed and aggregate cash flows of the principals and their entities generally should produce a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.25:1. \n \u2022 Cash or collateral equity injection by the applicant, ranging from 15% to 35% based on regulatory loan to value ratio limits, in order to meet minimum federal guidelines for each loan category. \n \u2022 Past experience of the investor in commercial real estate. \n \u2022 Past experience of the customer with the Bank. \n \u2022 Tangible net worth analysis of the borrower and any guarantors. \n \u2022 General and local commercial real estate conditions are monitored and considered in the decision-making process. \n \u2022 Alternative uses of the security are considered in the event of default. \n \u2022 Credit enhancements are utilized when necessary and desirable, such as the use of guarantors and take out commitments. \n \u2022 Non-construction real estate loans typically have a 15 to 20 year amortization with a five or seven year balloon payment. If appropriate, a loan may be set up as an interest only single payment if the identified repayment source coincides with the maturity. \n \u2022 Commercial construction projects generally require that an engineer or architect review the applicant's cost figures for accuracy. In addition, all draw requests must be approved by either the engineer or architect for accuracy before payment is made. \n \u2022 On-site progress inspections are completed to protect the Bank. \n \u2022 Requests for residential construction loans are closely monitored at the contractor level and subdivision level for concentrations. A request is generally denied if either the predetermined builder's concentration or Bank's concentration limit has been attained. \n \u2022 Real estate construction loans are made for terms not to exceed 12 to 18 months for residential construction and 18 to 24 months for commercial construction. \n \u2022 Collateral is investigated using current valuations and is supplemented by the loan officer's knowledge of the local market. Outside appraisals are completed by appraisers on the Bank's approved list. The appraisals on loans greater than $250,000 are reviewed to ensure they are compliant with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. \nResidential Real Estate\nResidential real estate makes up the second largest segment of our loan portfolio and outstanding balances have generally been very stable, as a percentage of loans outstanding. Terms generally range up to 15 years with amortizations of up to 30 years. Underwriting criteria and procedures for residential real estate mortgage loans generally include:\n \u2022 Monthly debt payments of the borrower to gross monthly income should not exceed 45% with stable employment of two years. \n \u2022 Loan to value ratio limits of up to 90% of the appraised value. \n \u2022 A credit investigation, which includes an Equifax credit report with a Beacon score of at least 620. \n \u2022 Verification of income by various methods. \n \u2022 Appropriate insurance to protect the Bank, typically in the amount of the loan. \n \u2022 Flood certifications are procured. \n \u2022 Collateral is investigated using current valuations and is supplemented by the loan officer's knowledge of the local market. Outside appraisals are completed by appraisers on the Bank's approved list. The appraisals on loans greater than $250,000 are reviewed to ensure they are compliant with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. \nFinancial\nFinancial loans are secured by stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Underwriting procedures and criteria for financial loans generally include:\n \u2022 Stock loans should be structured to coincide with the identified source of repayment. \n \u2022 The maximum loan to value ratio for stock listed for sale on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ is 85% of its market value. \n \u2022 Generally, stock loans should not exceed 60 months. \nAgricultural\nCrop production lending presents many risks to the lender because of weather uncertainty and fluctuations in commodity prices. Underwriting procedures and criteria for agricultural loans generally include:\n \u2022 The farmer should have the financial capacity to withstand at least one bad crop year. \n \u2022 The farmer must possess sufficient equity in equipment or farmland for the Bank to term, within acceptable collateral margins (ranging from 50% to 80%) and cash flow debt service coverage requirements (generally 1.25:1), any line outstanding after the sale of crops. \n \u2022 Farmers should meet certain qualitative criteria with respect to the farmer's knowledge and experience. \n \u2022 For new customers, documentation on where the farmer previously banked and the circumstances underlying the new loan request. \nCommercial Inventory and Accounts Receivable\nUnderwriting procedures and loan to value ratios for commercial inventory loans and accounts receivable loans generally include:\n \u2022 Up to 80% of eligible accounts receivable. \n \u2022 Up to 80% of the individually assigned accounts receivable. The customer assigns individual invoices, sometimes with shipping documents attached. These may be stamped or marked to show that they have been assigned to the Bank. The customer brings payments to the Bank for processing against individual invoices. \n \u2022 50% or less of the cost or market on materials and qualified finished goods, depending on their quality and stability. \n \u2022 0% on work-in-progress. \nInstallment Loans\nThese loans are predominantly direct loans to established customers of the Bank and primarily include the financing of automobiles, boats, and other consumer goods. The character, capacity, collateral, and conditions are evaluated using policy limitations. Installment loans are typically made for terms that do not exceed 60 months with any exceptions being documented. Installment loan underwriting criteria and procedures for such financing generally include:\n \u2022 Financial statements are generally required on all consumer loans secured by a primary residence, all unsecured loans of $10,000 or more, and all secured transactions of $50,000 or more. \n \u2022 Income verification is generally required on all consumer loans. \n \u2022 Past experience of the customer with the Bank. \n \u2022 A debt to income ratio that does not exceed 45%. \n \u2022 Stable employment record of two years. \n \u2022 Stable residency record of two years. \n \u2022 A Beacon score of at least 620. \n \u2022 Terms to match the usefulness or life of the security. \n \u2022 If unsecured, the total unsecured loans of the applicant should not exceed 15% of adjusted net worth or 20% of the applicant's gross annual income. \nInterest Only Loans\nInterest only loans are generally limited to construction lending, properties recently completed and undergoing occupancy stabilization period, and revolving lines of credit. Any other loans made as interest only should have a reason and proper approval.\nBank policy generally prohibits underwriting negative amortization loans or hybrid loans.\nThe following loan table describes our loan portfolio composition by segment based on the loan classifications discussed in Note D - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses to the financial statements for December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (amounts in thousands):\n\nThe maturities and carrying amounts of loans, excluding credit cards, as of December 31, 2016 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $147.0 million of variable rate loans with interest rate floors in effect (i.e., the floor rate exceeded the variable rate). Interest rates on these loans will not adjust until the underlying index plus any rate adjuster increases above the floor rate.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans, accruing loans which are past due 90 days or more, repossessed assets, other real estate owned (\"foreclosed assets\"), and certain loans held for sale which are classified as nonperforming. Nonperforming loans are loans that have been placed into nonaccrual status when doubts arise regarding the full collectability of principal or interest and we are therefore uncertain that the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status at the point when the loan becomes past due 90 days unless there is sufficient documentation to establish that the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. These nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status when the factors which initially indicated the doubtful collectability of the loans have ceased to exist. Foreclosed assets consists typically of real estate assets acquired either through foreclosure proceedings or deed in lieu of foreclosure. Foreclosed assets are recorded at an estimated fair value less costs to sell the property, or the recorded investment in the loan at the time of foreclosure, whichever is less. These assets are periodically evaluated and any decreases in the property's fair value result in corresponding write downs of the asset's carrying value.\nAs of December 31, 2016, nonperforming assets declined $2.4 million or 28.2% when compared to December 31, 2015. The Company's ratio of nonperforming assets to regulatory Tier 1 capital plus the allowance has improved during the year. At December 31, 2016, this ratio was 8% compared to 12% at December 31, 2015.\nThe following table describes our nonperforming asset portfolio composition by category based on the loan classifications discussed in Note D - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses to the financial statements for December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (amounts in thousands):\n\nForeclosed Assets\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were 26 foreclosed properties valued at $1.7 million compared to 35 foreclosed properties valued at $1.8 million as of December 31, 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, a significant portion of the $1.7 million value of foreclosed properties was due to the addition of one property in the amount of $863,000 in the first quarter of 2016. The amount of loans transferred into foreclosed assets decreased from $1.2 million for the year ending December 31, 2015 to $1.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. Sales of foreclosed assets decreased to $700,000 in 2016 compared to $3.0 million in 2015 as the number and value of properties in the portfolio continues to decline. The continued decline in foreclosed assets resulted primarily from sales of foreclosed properties and reductions in the number of properties added to foreclosed assets.\nNonaccrual and TDR Loans\nInterest income is calculated by the relevant interest method based upon the daily outstanding balance of the loan. The recognition of interest income ceases however when it becomes probable that full collectability of all interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement may not occur. As a result, loans may either be placed in nonaccrual status and/or restructured to allow for a payment stream which may appropriately accommodate a borrower's diminished repayment capacity. Restructured loans are those for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal have been granted due to the borrower's weakened financial condition. Such restructured loans are typically initially placed into nonaccrual status and may later be returned to accrual status depending upon a demonstrated ability by the borrower to meet the repayment terms of the restructured loan. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied first to principal and thereafter interest only after all principal has been collected. We accrue interest on restructured loans at the restructured rates when we anticipate that no loss of original principal will occur.\nNonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans decreased to 0.85% as of December 31, 2016 compared to 1.44% as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, there were 29 nonaccrual loans totaling $4.3 million compared to 42 loans totaling $6.6 million at December 31, 2015. The gross interest income that would have been recorded for loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $196,000 and $153,000, respectively. These amounts represent interest income that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination, if held for part of the period.\nLoans are classified as a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\") when, for economic or legal reasons which result in a debtor experiencing financial difficulties, the Company grants a concession through a modification of the original loan agreement that would not otherwise be considered. Loans in the process of renewal or modification are reviewed by the Company to determine if the risk grade assigned is accurate based on updated information. The Company's policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a TDR process follows relevant supervisory guidance. If a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is considered and the loan is considered performing. If the borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual and nonperforming until such time as continued performance has been demonstrated, which is typically a period of at least six consecutive payments. If the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were six restructured loans in accrual status compared to eight as of December 31, 2015. Regardless of whether any individual TDR is performing, all TDRs are considered to be impaired and are evaluated as such in the allowance for loan losses calculation. As of December 31, 2016, the recorded investment in performing TDRs and their related allowance for loan losses totaled $1.2 million and $0, respectively, compared to $2.3 million and $328,000 as of December 31, 2015. Outstanding nonperforming TDRs totaled $802,000 with $156,000 in specific reserves as of December 31, 2016 compared to $1.1 million in outstanding nonperforming TDRs with $139,000 in related allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015. The amount of interest recognized for performing and nonperforming TDRs during the twelve months of 2016 was approximately $73,000 and $10,000, respectively.\nThe following table describes performing and nonperforming TDRs for December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (amounts in thousands):\n\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Summary of Loan Loss Experience\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through periodic charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. Increases to the allowance for loan losses occur as a result of provisions charged to operations and recoveries of amounts previously charged-off, and decreases to the allowance occur when loans are charged-off because management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Management evaluates the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis. The evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves the consideration of loan growth, loan portfolio composition and industry diversification, historical loan loss experience, current delinquency levels, adverse conditions that might affect a borrower's ability to repay the loan, estimated value of underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and all other relevant factors derived from our history of operations. Additionally, regulatory agencies review our allowance for loan losses and may require additional provisions for estimated losses based on judgments that differ from those of management.\nManagement has developed a model for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The model uses the Company's internal grading system to quantify the risk of each loan. The grade is initially assigned by the lending officer and/or the credit administration function. The internal grading system is reviewed and tested periodically by an independent internal loan review function as well as an independent external credit review firm. The testing process involves the evaluation of a sample of new loans, loans having been identified as possessing potential weakness in credit quality, and past due and nonaccrual loans to determine the ongoing effectiveness of the internal grading system. Additionally, regulatory agencies review the adequacy of the risk grades assigned as well as the risk grade process and may require changes based on judgments that differ from those of management that could impact the allowance for loan losses.\nThe grading system is comprised of seven risk categories for active loans. Grades 1 through 4 demonstrate various degrees of risk, but each is considered to have the capacity to perform in accordance with the terms of the loan. Loans possessing a grade of 5 exhibit characteristics which indicate higher risk that the loan may not be able to perform in accordance with the terms of the loan. Grade 6 loans are considered sub-standard and are generally impaired, however, certain of these loans continue to accrue interest, and are not TDRs and are not considered impaired. Grade 7 loans are considered doubtful and would be included in nonaccrual loans. Grade 8 loans are considered uncollectable and identified as a confirmed loss. Loans can also be classified as non-accrual, TDR, or otherwise impaired, all of which are considered impaired and evaluated for specific reserve under FASB Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 310-10 regardless of the risk grade assigned.\nOnce a loan has been determined to meet the definition of impairment, the amount of that impairment is measured through one of two available methods: a calculation of the net present value of the expected future cash flows of the loan discounted by the effective interest rate of the loan or upon the fair market value of the underlying assets securing the loan. If the fair market value of collateral method is selected for use, an updated collateral value is generally obtained based on where the loan is in the collection process and the age of the existing appraisal. Each loan is then analyzed to determine the net value of collateral or cash flows and an estimate of potential loss. The net value of collateral per our analysis is determined using various subjective discounts, selling expenses and a review of the assumptions used to generate the current appraisal. If collection is deemed to be collateral dependent then the deficiency is generally charged off. Appraised values on real estate collateral are subject to constant change and management makes certain assumptions about how the age of an appraisal impacts current value. Impaired loans are re-evaluated periodically to determine the adequacy of specific reserves and charge-offs. Groups of small dollar impaired loans with similar risk characteristics may be evaluated for impairment collectively.\nLoans that are not assessed for specific reserves under FASB ASC 310-10 are reserved for under FASB ASC 450. The loans analyzed under FASB ASC 450 are assigned a reserve based on a quantitative factor and a qualitative factor. The quantitative factor is based on historical charge-off levels and is adjusted for the loan's risk grade. The qualitative factors address loan growth, loan portfolio composition and industry diversification, historical loan loss experience, current delinquency levels, prevailing economic conditions and all other relevant factors derived from our history of operations. Together these two components comprise the ASC 450, or general reserve.\nThe Company utilizes a five year look back period to determine historical loss rates under the quantitative ASC 450 reserve. The Company calculates historical loss rates from the most recent five years on a rolling quarter basis to provide an estimate of potential losses and to provide for the highest base charge-off rate regardless of whether the historical charge-offs are improving or declining. In addition, the Bank assigns a different percentage (\"multiplier\") of the base charge-off rate to the balances for each risk grade within a loan category to reflect the varied risk of charge-off for each. The standard multipliers range from 0% for a risk grade 1 to 300% for a risk grade 6 that is unimpaired. In addition, categories that have a concentrated level of charge-offs associated with a particular risk grade could have an additional reserve factor of 50% to 100% added to that particular risk grade. Lastly, categories that have had historically high charge-offs also have an additional reserve factor between 25% to 100% added to the risk grade 5s and 6s to account for the additional risk in those categories. The reserve amount by risk grade is calculated and then combined for a blended quantitative reserve factor for each loan category.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016 was $9.6 million, which represents 1.9% of total loans outstanding compared to $9.6 million or 2.1% as of December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net loan recoveries were $31,000 compared to $239,000 for the prior year period because the volume of total charge-offs and recoveries continued to decline as asset quality normalizes. Non-accrual loans were $4.3 million and $6.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 30-89 day past due numbers are down to $493,000 as of December 31, 2016 compared to $1.2 million as of December 31, 2015, a 57.9% decrease.\nThe ASC 450 reserve as of December 31, 2015 was 2.2% compared to 1.7% as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $5.1 million in loans in the coastal North Carolina region which are collateralized by properties that have seen significant declines in value since the loans' origination, compared to $6.6 million as of December 31, 2015. Those loans in this category that are evaluated as part of the ASC 450 general reserve are being reserved at an average of 43.8% as of December 31, 2016.\nImpaired loans evaluated for specific reserve as of December 31, 2016 were $5.4 million compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decline of $3.2 million or 37.6%. The ASC 310 reserve was $1.0 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $1.3 million as of December 31, 2015.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of an appropriate amount to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business. While management believes the methodology used to establish the allowance for loan losses incorporates the best information available at the time, future adjustments to the level of the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be adversely affected should circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions initially used. We believe that the allowance for loan losses was established in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles; however, there can be no assurances that the regulatory agencies, after reviewing the loan portfolio, will not require management to increase the level of the allowance. Likewise, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate should there be deterioration in the quality of any loans or changes in any of the factors discussed above. Any increases in the provision for loan losses resulting from such deterioration or change in condition could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table summarizes the Bank's loan loss experience for the years ending December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (amounts in thousands, except ratios):\n\nThe following table summarizes the Bank's allocation of allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (amounts in thousands, except ratios).\n\n(1) Represents total of all outstanding loans in each category as a percentage of total loans outstanding.\nDeposits\nDeposits are the primary source of funds for our portfolio loans, loan pipeline and investments. Our deposit strategy is to obtain deposit funds from within our market areas through relationship banking. The majority of our deposits are from individuals and entities located in our primary markets of Johnston and Wake counties. We are positioned to obtain wholesale deposits, including brokered deposits, from various sources in order to supplement our liquidity if needed. As of December 31, 2016, total deposits were approximately $553.5 million, up from $542.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing transaction accounts, which include savings, money market and interest checking, increased $40.0 million or 12.8%. Time deposits declined $28.8 million as we did not replace wholesale time deposits that matured during 2016 and continue to execute a strategy of exiting high cost time deposits for non-relationship customers.\nWholesale deposits, including time deposits placed in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service, (\"CDARS\"), and various brokered deposit programs decreased $17.2 million, or 41.4%, from $41.5 million as of December 31, 2015, to $24.3 million at December 31, 2016 as some brokered deposit maturities were not replaced. The CDARS program provides full FDIC insurance on deposit balances greater than posted FDIC limits by exchanging larger depository relationships with other CDARS members. CDARS is offered as a service to our customers who either require or desire full FDIC insurance coverage of their deposits.\nTime certificates in amounts of $250,000 or more outstanding at December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, by maturity were as follows (amounts in thousands):\n\nBorrowings\nThe Bank borrows funds principally from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the \"FHLB\"). During 2016, the Bank increased total advances by $10.0 million as compared to December 31, 2015.\nInformation regarding borrowings at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, are as follows (amounts in thousands, except rates):\n\nIn late 2015, the Company sold $11.5 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated promissory notes. These notes are due on November 30, 2025 and the Company is obligated to pay interest at an annualized rate of 6.25% payable in quarterly installments commencing on March 1, 2016. The Company may prepay the notes at any time after November 30, 2020, subject to compliance with applicable law. The proceeds of the offering were used to refinance the Company's then outstanding subordinated promissory notes issued in 2009.\nOn March 30, 2006, $12.4 million of trust preferred securities (the Trust Preferred Securities\u201d) were placed through the Trust. The Trust has invested the net proceeds from the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities in Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the Debentures\u201d) issued by the Company and recorded in borrowings on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Trust Preferred Securities pay cumulative cash distributions quarterly at an annual rate, reset quarterly, equal to three month LIBOR plus 1.35%. The dividends paid to holders of the Trust Preferred Securities, which will be recorded as interest expense, are deductible for income tax purposes. The Trust Preferred Securities are redeemable in whole or in part, on any June 15, September 15, December 15, or March 15. Redemption is mandatory by June 15, 2036.\nThe Bank may purchase federal funds through secured federal funds lines of credit with various banks. These lines are intended for short-term borrowings and are payable on demand and bear interest based upon the daily federal funds rate. For 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Bank purchased no federal funds except in conjunction with semi-annual testing of the borrowing lines available. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank had no federal funds borrowings outstanding under these lines.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOverview\nPre-tax net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $5.3 million compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2015, an increase of $1.8 million or 50%. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $6.9 million, or $1.06 net income per basic and $1.04 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $20.0 million, or $3.12 net income per basic and $3.10 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported an income tax benefit of $1.6 million compared to an income tax benefit of $16.5 million for the same period in 2015. The prior year income tax benefit resulted from the partial reversal of the valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets executed in the second quarter of 2015. The current year income tax benefit was due to the reversal of substantially all of the remaining valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets executed in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet interest income totaled $24.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $22.6 million for the same period in 2015, an increase of $1.8 million or 7.8%. Net interest margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was 3.7% compared to 3.3% for the same period in 2015. The primary driver of the improved margins and overall net interest income was the reduction in funding costs due to the balance sheet strategies executed in late 2015. The 2015 balance sheet strategies included the extinguishment of high-cost long term borrowings and refinancing the Company's subordinated debt at lower rates. Additionally contributing to the increase was additional interest income on loans from the portfolio growth during 2016.\nNon-interest income was $5.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in gains from the sale of problem loans as we completed the previously disclosed Asset Resolution Plan during 2015 and had few loan sales during 2016. Additionally, we completed our exit from the ACH third party payment processor business line in 2015 and indemnification income from this exit was absent from 2016 totals. Other factors contributing to the overall decline were less significant but included reduced premium income from the sale of government guaranteed loans and reductions in service charges on deposit accounts.\nNon-interest expense totaled $24.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $28.6 million for the same period in 2015. As previously mentioned, the Company restructured the balance sheet during the fourth quarter 2015, resulting in the extinguishment of high-cost long term borrowings. The absence of these long term debt extinguishment costs in 2016 was a primary driver in the overall decline of non-interest expense. Another significant contributor included a reduction in salary expense in 2016 as the Company exited certain personnel contracts and incurred related expenses during 2015 as it transitioned the leadership team.\nNet Interest Income\nThe primary component of earnings for the Bank is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income, principally from loan and investment securities, and interest expense, principally on customer deposits and borrowings. Changes in net interest income result from changes in volume, spread and margin. For this purpose, volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as by levels of non-interest-bearing liabilities and capital.\nNet interest income increased by $1.8 million or 7.8%, to $24.4 million in 2016 from $22.6 million in 2015. The net interest margin increased 40 basis points to 3.74% in 2016 from a net interest margin of 3.29% in the previous year. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to declines in interest expense of $2.0 million driven primarily by reductions in high cost long term borrowings that were paid down or refinanced during 2015. Interest expense on FHLB borrowings declined $1.6 million or 51.7% as compared to 2015. Also contributing to the decline in interest expense was the refinancing of the Company's subordinated promissory notes during late 2015 from an interest rate of 8.50% to 6.25%. The reduction in rate and $500,000 reduction in balances resulted in savings of approximately $300,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This improvement in overall net interest income was offset by a reduction in total interest income of $178,000 as overall investment balances and resulting interest income declined and was only partially offset by increases in interest income on loans.\nOn average, our interest-earning assets declined $36.6 million during 2016 from 2015; however, the rate earned on these assets increased 21 basis points. The primary drivers for the decline in interest-earning assets were reductions in interest earning deposits with banks and total investments offset by increases in average loans. Interest earning deposits in banks, which carried a relatively low yield, declined $42.6 million during the year while average investments declined $18.7 million. Part of this decline was from the ACH TPPP business line exit during 2015 which caused us to carry elevated levels of interest bearing deposits during the exit process. This was offset by increases in average loans which grew $25.1 million during 2016. Interest bearing liabilities declined $9.1 million as we remained focus on improving balance sheet efficiency to ensure any unnecessary funding was eliminated. In addition to the total reduction in interest bearing liabilities, the rate paid on these liabilities declined 36 basis points driven primarily by reductions in high cost long term borrowings paid down during 2015.\nWe set interest rates on deposits and loans at competitive rates. Interest rate spreads have increased from 3.0% in 2015 to 3.5% for 2016. The interest rate spread is the difference between the interest rates earned on average loans and investments, and the interest rates paid on average interest-bearing deposits and borrowings.\nThe following schedule presents average balance sheet information for the years 2016, 2015, and 2014, along with related interest earned and average yields for interest-earning assets and the interest paid and average rates for interest-bearing liabilities (amounts in thousands, except for average rates). Nonaccrual notes are included in loan amounts.\n\nThe following table shows changes in interest income and expense by category and rate/volume variances for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The changes due to rate and volume were allocated on their absolute values (amounts in thousands, except for average rates):\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is charged to bring the allowance for loan losses to the level deemed appropriate by management after adjusting for recoveries of amounts previously charged off. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and results from management's consideration of such factors as the financial condition of borrowers, past and expected loss experience, current economic conditions, and other factors management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no provision for the allowance for loan looses was recognized in earnings.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $5.8 million, as compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $3.8 million. The principal drivers for the decline are related to non-recurring items that either declined significantly year over year or were absent during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Total gains from problem loan sales were $351,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2015, a $2.9 million decline due to the Company completing disposal of loans identified in the Asset Resolution Plan during 2015. Additionally, the Company exited the ACH third party payment processor business line in 2015 which resulted in a loss of $445,000 on indemnification income from the prior year and also contributed to the decline in other non-interest income. Other less significant factors furthering the decline in non-interest income were reductions in other service charges, commissions and fees largely due to reduced premium income from the sale of government guaranteed loans and reduced insufficient funds charges on deposit accounts.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $24.8 million, as compared to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $3.8 million. The balance sheet strategies executed in 2015 that entailed paying down high cost long term borrowings by $40.0 million led to $2.1 million in related extinguishment costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The absence of this expense in 2016 was a primary driver in the decline in non-interest expense for the twelve month period. During late 2015, the Company also incurred one-time costs associated with changes in three members of the executive management team that contributed to non-recurring salary expenses of $1.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Reductions were seen in almost all other expense categories as we continued reviewing ways to improve efficiency and reduce expenses. These declines were offset by an increase of $282,000 in employee benefits which was primarily due to the absence of a premium holiday by our medical insurance provider and the increase in our 401K plan match during 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported a $1.6 million income tax benefit as compared to a $16.5 million benefit for this same period in 2015. For both periods, the income tax benefit recorded was the result of a reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets net of income tax expense. Since the partial valuation allowance reversal executed in the second quarter of 2015, the Company continued to assess both positive and negative evidence to determine the ability to fully utilize the deferred tax assets prior to its expiration. During the fourth quarter of 2016, based upon the assessment of all positive and negative evidence, we determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character that would fully allow it to utilize the deferred tax assets and reversed substantially all of the remaining valuation allowance.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs part of its normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers, the Bank is at times a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet credit risk. Such instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2016, the Bank's outstanding commitments to extend credit consisted of undisbursed lines of credit, other commitments to extend, undisbursed portion of construction loans and stand-by letters of credit of $136.0 million. See Note L - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding the Bank's off-balance sheet risk exposure.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and in the strength of financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital resources. The term \"liquidity\" refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs for funding loan originations, deposit withdrawals, maturities of borrowings and operating expenses. Management measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off-balance sheet sources of, and demands for, funds on a daily and weekly basis.\nSources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents (net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities), investment securities eligible for pledging to secure borrowings, investments available-for-sale, loan repayments, loan sales, deposits and borrowings from the FHLB secured with pledged loans and securities, and from correspondent banks under overnight federal funds credit lines. During the twelve months ended 2016, the Company's primary use of its excess liquidity was to fund growth in the loan portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2016, our outstanding commitments to extend credit consisted of loan commitments of $21.1 million, undisbursed lines of credit of $97.4 million, unused credit card lines of $16.6 million, financial stand-by letters of credit of $439,000 and performance stand-by letters of credit of $422,000. We believe that our combined aggregate liquidity position from all sources is sufficient to meet the funding requirements of loan demand, and deposit maturities and withdrawals in the near term.\nAt December 31, 2015, our outstanding commitments to extend credit consisted of loan commitments of $29.4 million, undisbursed lines of credit of $94.2 million, unused credit card lines of $16.0 million, financial stand-by letters of credit of $438,000 and performance stand-by letters of credit of $233,000.\nCertificates of deposits represented 36.4% of our total deposits at December 31, 2016, a decrease from 42.4% at December 31, 2015. Brokered and out-of-market certificates of deposit totaled $24.3 million at year-end 2016 and $41.5 million at year-end 2015, which comprised 4.4% and 7.7% of total deposits, respectively. Certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more, inclusive of brokered and out-of-market certificates, represented 5.4% of our total deposits at December 31, 2016 and 6.5% at December 31, 2015. Large certificates of deposits are generally considered rate sensitive. While we will need to pay competitive rates to retain these deposits at their maturities, there are other subjective factors that will determine their continued retention.\nOn August 15, 2014, the Company closed the Rights Offering and Standby Offering with Kenneth R. Lehman, a private investor, who later became a member of our Board of Directors. In connection with the Rights Offering and Standby Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,800,000 shares of its common stock at $5.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $24.0 million.\nManagement believes that the Company's liquidity sources are adequate to meet its operating needs for the next twelve months. Total shareholders' equity was $68.0 million or 9.45% of total assets at December 31, 2016 and $60.4 million or 8.74% of total assets at December 31, 2015. Supplementing customer deposits as a source of funding, we have available lines of credit from various correspondent banks to purchase federal funds on a short-term basis of approximately $37.0 million that remain unused at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has the credit capacity to borrow up to $180.3 million from the FHLB with $70.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2016.\nThe Company had total risk based capital of 15.6%, Tier 1 risk based capital of 12.2%, a leverage ratio of 9.5%, and common equity Tier 1 capital of 10.9% at December 31, 2016, as compared to 16.0%, 12.4%, 8.8%, and 11.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. The Bank had total risk based capital of 15.4%, Tier 1 risk based capital of 14.1%, a leverage ratio of 11.0%, and common equity Tier 1 capital of 14.1% at December 31, 2016, as compared to 15.6%, 14.4%, 10.2%, and 14.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, both the Company and the Bank were well capitalized.\nThe Company sold $11.5 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated promissory notes to certain accredited investors in December 2015. These notes are due on November 30, 2025 and the Company is obligated to pay interest at an annualized rate of 6.25% payable in quarterly installments commencing on March 1, 2016. The Company may prepay the notes at any time after November 30, 2020, subject to compliance with applicable law. The proceeds were used to refinance the Company's then outstanding subordinated promissory notes issued in 2009.\nThe Company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock since it suspended dividends in the fourth quarter of 2010. As a bank holding company, the Company's ability to declare and pay dividends also depends on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. A decision to pay any dividend in the future would be determined based on a number of factors including capital position and capital adequacy, ongoing operations and profitability, the risk profile of the institution and general market conditions, among other things.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increases in the price of goods and services resulting in higher operating expenses. In management's opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. During periods of high inflation, there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply, and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets, loans, and deposits.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note A - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and management's assessment of the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe that the allowance for loan losses, other than temporary impairment of investments available-for-sale, valuation of foreclosed assets, and income taxes, represent particularly sensitive accounting estimates.\nSee Note A - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, and other statements set forth elsewhere in this report, for a comprehensive view of significant accounting estimates and policies.", "item_7_tables": "Table 24: <table><tr><td> </td>
