Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis item contains a discussion of our business, including a general overview of our business, properties, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page 73. This Item 7 contains forward-looking\u201d statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur fiscal year end is the final day in February. Our fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 ended February 28, 2022, February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively, and were each fifty-two-week periods.\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of cloud-based, end-to-end SCM software. Our platform spans many key strategic and operational areas including omni-channel, demand sensing, supply planning, global trade management, transportation and logistics and manufacturing and supply management. Our software combines networks, data and applications to provide a deeply embedded, mission-critical platform that allows clients to optimize their channel and supply chains by accelerating growth, reducing costs, increasing visibility and driving improved resiliency. Given the mission-critical nature of our solutions, we maintain long-term relationships with our clients, which is reflected by our high gross retention and long client tenure. In aggregate, we serve approximately 6,000 clients in all major countries in the world across a wide range of end-markets, including consumer goods, food and beverage, manufacturing, retail, technology and transportation, among others. Our large enterprise clients represent approximately 600 of our clients and are those who, when aggregated to their parent company, report greater than $1 billion in annual revenue and generate $50,000 or more of our annual subscriptions revenue.\nWe operate in what we believe is an attractive industry with strong secular tailwinds and a TAM of more than $54 billion. This TAM is comprised of significant whitespace, which we estimate to be in excess of $1 billion just within our current client base. This upsell opportunity within our existing client base is largely driven by their current technology solution which is often a combination of legacy point solutions and home-grown applications, which are tied together with manual processes and spreadsheets. As manufacturing has evolved from brands owning the full production lifecycle to orchestrating disparate manufacturing, distribution and selling processes conducted across multiple geographies, supply chains have grown more complex, increasing demand for software solutions like ours and the need to modernize the existing technology landscape with cloud-based modern solutions. We believe our fully cloud-based, end-to-end software platform offers a more connected solution for clients that gives them better value as compared to solutions offered by some of our competitors.\nOur Go-To-Market Strategy\nOur go-to-market strategy is focused on both expanding the adoption of our product portfolio with existing clients and the acquisition of new clients. We primarily focus our selling efforts on large enterprise organizations and sell our software primarily through a direct sales force and are expanding our go-to-market presence with partners. Our go-to-market strategy enables our sales force to develop deep, long-term relationships with existing and potential clients across the relevant functions, from buying managers, IT resources, division leaders and C-level executives. Importantly, we believe that our go-to-market approach focused on clients is a competitive advantage compared to competitors whose go-to-market approach is often focused on products, as our clients have one seller who owns the relationship irrespective of the product of interest. We believe this enables us to sustain our high client retention and long client tenure as well as drive maximum spend within each client through an efficient sales model.\nOur sales and marketing organizations are comprised of field sales, inside sales and sales development personnel, and we align these teams based on client size and industry. We focus initially on solving a client's primary need, usually a specific piece of their supply chain. Once a client adopts our solution and witnesses the power of our unique platform, we focus on cross-selling additional products as well as expanding into additional departments, divisions and geographies with the same solution. We have found that experience with our SaaS platform is the most effective selling tool.\nThe Business Combination\nOn February 4, 2021, E2open Holdings and CCNB1 completed the Business Combination contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, CCNB1 acquired a majority interest in E2open Holdings through a series of mergers, with E2open Holdings becoming a direct subsidiary of CCNB1. In connection with the completion of the Business Combination, CCNB1 changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware and changed its name to E2open Parent Holdings, Inc.\u201d\nUpon completion of the Business Combination, CCNB1 was deemed the accounting acquirer and E2open the accounting acquiree. Under the acquisition method of accounting, CCNB1's assets and liabilities retained their carrying values and the assets and liabilities associated with E2open Holdings were recorded at their fair values measured as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The cash consideration in the Business Combination included cash from (1) the Trust Account in the amount of $414.0 million, (2) $525.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of a new term loan, (3) $695.0 million in proceeds from the PIPE Investment and (4) $200.0 million in proceeds from Forward Purchase Agreement. These proceeds were used to pay (x) $601.1 million in cash consideration payable to certain equity owners and option holders of E2open Holdings, including certain non-recurring seller transaction expenses, (y) $978.5 million of existing E2open debt and accrued interest and (z) total non-recurring transaction costs of $105.2 million. The non-recurring transaction costs included acquisition-related advisory fees in connection with the Business Combination, deferred underwriting commissions in connection with CCNB1's IPO and debt issuance costs related to the new credit agreement entered into in connection with the Business Combination but excluded certain seller costs to be paid by the equity owners of E2open Holdings. The deferred underwriting commissions and costs pertaining to the reverse merger were treated as a reduction of equity while merger-related costs were expensed in the period in which the Business Combination closed. The debt issuance costs were capitalized as a reduction to the outstanding debt balances. In addition, certain options to purchase equity interests in E2open Holdings were accelerated upon the Closing Date, which resulted in a non-recurring expense of approximately $28.2 million in the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021. Additionally, unit-based compensation expense of $4.7 million was recognized during the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 related to the restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination for the accelerated unvested options and restricted units.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, our prior year financial results are broken out between the Predecessor period (March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021) and the Successor period (February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021).\nBluJay Acquisition\nOn September 1, 2021, we completed the BluJay Acquisition with the issuance of 72,383,299 shares of Class A Common Stock to the BluJay Sellers and the payment of approximately $771.3 million of cash which includes the repayment of BluJay's debt facility. The total purchase consideration for the BluJay Acquisition was $1.5 billion.\nIn connection with the completion of the BluJay Acquisition, we secured $300 million in PIPE financing from institutional investors for the purchase of an aggregate of 28,909,022 shares of our Class A Common Stock. We also obtained a $380.0 million incremental term loan to our 2021 Term Loan and increased our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility by $80.0 million to $155.0 million. In addition, the letter of credit sublimit was increased from $15.0 million to $30.0 million upon completion of the BluJay Acquisition.\nAdditionally, the Investor Rights Agreement was amended and restated to add certain of BluJay's existing stockholders as parties, including certain affiliates of Francisco Partners and Temasek as well as include a six month lock-up period from September 1, 2021 through February 28, 2022 for certain equity holders of E2open and BluJay. The Investor Rights Agreement also provided Francisco Partners and Temasek the right to nominate one member each to our board of directors. Mr. Deep Shah and Mr. Martin Fichtner became new directors on September 1, 2021.\nLogistyx Acquisition\nOn March 2, 2022, we acquired Logistyx for a purchase price of $185 million, with an estimated fair value of $183.7 million, including $90 million paid in cash at closing. An additional $95 million will be paid in two installments on May 31, 2022 and August 29, 2022. We have the option to fulfill the remaining payments, at our discretion, through cash or a combination of cash and our Class A Common Stock. The May 31, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $5.0 million in cash with the total payment equal to $37.4 million. The August 29, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $26.1 million in cash with the total payment equal to $57.6 million.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused business disruptions worldwide beginning in January 2020. The full extent to which the pandemic will impact our business, operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments that are difficult to accurately predict. We have experienced modest adverse impacts as it relates to lengthening of sales cycles and delays in delivering professional services and training to our clients, primarily in our fiscal 2021 period. However, the delays have resulted in operational savings related in such areas as travel and entertainment, marketing expenses due to virtual versus in-person events and facility costs resulting from the move to a remote workforce. Those savings continued throughout most of our fiscal 2022 year.\nAlthough parts of our business have seemingly returned to pre-pandemic levels, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge in various areas of the world demonstrating that the impact of the pandemic is not yet complete. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we are carefully monitoring the situation to understand its impacts on our business and operations.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe account for all client contracts under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), and all the related amendments. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions and professional services. We recognize revenue when the client contract and associated performance obligations have been identified; the transaction price has been determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract; and the performance obligations have been satisfied.\nSubscription Revenue\nWe offer cloud-based on-demand software solutions, which enable our clients to have constant access to our solutions without the need to manage and support the software and associated hardware themselves. We house the hardware and software in third-party facilities and provide our clients with access to the software solutions, along with data security and storage, backup, recovery services and solution support. Logistics as a service employs logistics professionals to manage a company's transportation network including truck, rail, ocean and air freight as well as inbound/outbound logistics from production facilities to warehouses, retailers and end users/consumers. Our client contracts typically have a term of three to five years, and we recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contracts.\nWe charge primarily fixed annual subscription fees or, in limited cases, transaction fees based on the volume of transactions requested by clients. Typically, the volume-based fees are for small clients and comprise a small percentage of this revenue source.\nFor subscription-based contracts, we generally invoice annually in advance. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. For transactional based contracts, we primarily recognize revenue for these contracts when the performance obligation is fulfilled. Transaction based contracts represented less than 3% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 and the combined Successor and Predecessor periods in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nProfessional Services and Other\nProfessional services revenue is derived primarily from fees for enabling services, including consulting and deployment services for purchased solutions. These services are often sold in conjunction with the sale of our solutions. We provide professional services primarily on a time and materials basis, but sometimes on a fixed fee basis. Clients are invoiced for professional services either monthly in arrears or, as with fixed fee arrangements, in advance and upon reaching project milestones. Professional services revenue is recognized over time. For services that are contracted at a fixed price, progress is generally measured based on labor hours incurred as a percentage of the total estimated hours required for complete satisfaction of the related performance obligations. For services that are contracted on time and materials or a prepaid basis, progress is generally based on actual labor hours expended. These input methods (e.g., hours incurred or expended and milestone completion) are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy services contracts as they represent the performance obligation consumed by the client and performed by us, and therefore reflect the transfer of services to a client under contract.\nWe enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations comprised of subscriptions and professional services. Arrangements with clients typically do not provide the client with the right to take possession of the software supporting the on-demand solutions. We primarily account for subscription and professional services revenue as separate units of accounting and allocate revenue to each deliverable in an arrangement based on a standalone selling price. We evaluate the standalone selling price for each element by considering prices we charge for similar offerings, size of the order and historical pricing practices.\nOther revenue primarily includes license fees and travel expenses for services rendered. Other revenue is recognized when the service is delivered to the client.\nTotal Revenue by Geographic Locations\nRevenues by geographical region consisted of the following:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended February 28, 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 4, 2021\nthrough\nFebruary 28, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 1, 2020\nthrough\nFebruary 3, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\nEnded February 29, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>366,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>305,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of our contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the client, or where the software solutions are being utilized or accessed. Americas revenue was approximately 86%, 96%, 96% and 96% during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 and fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during these periods.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Subscription Revenue\nCost of subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to delivering our service and providing support to clients, including personnel and related costs, costs associated with data center operations and capacity, fees paid to third parties to license their technology and depreciation expense directly related to delivering our solutions. Cost of subscription revenue also includes the costs associated with our logistics as a service revenue which consists of costs related to managing a company's transportation network including truck, rail, ocean and air freight as well as inbound/outbound logistics from production facilities to warehouses, retailers and end users/consumers. We generally expense our cost of subscription revenue as we incur the costs.\nCost of Professional Services and Other Revenue\nCost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel and related travel costs, the costs of contracted third-party vendors and reimbursable expenses. As our personnel are employed on a full-time basis, our cost of professional services is largely fixed in the short-term, while our professional services and other revenue may fluctuate, leading to fluctuations in professional services and other gross profit. We expense our cost of professional services and other revenue as we incur the costs.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs of our research and development staff, costs of certain third-party contractors, depreciation, amortization and other allocated costs. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred, excluding the capitalization of internally developed software costs.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our sales and marketing staff. It also includes the costs of promotional events, corporate communications, online marketing, solution marketing and other brand-building activities, in addition to depreciation, amortization and other allocated costs. When the initial client contract is signed and upon any renewal, we capitalize and amortize commission costs under ASC 606, as an expense over the period in which products are expected to be delivered to clients, where the commission is directly attributable to a contract, including expected renewals, which is estimated to be four years. If a subscription agreement is terminated, we recognize the unamortized portion of any deferred commission cost as an expense immediately upon such termination. Certain sales commissions are contingent on future client billings and are expensed as incurred to sales and marketing expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our executive, administrative, finance, information technology, legal, accounting, investor relations and human resource staff. It also includes professional fees; expenses related to our board of directors; public company costs; other corporate expenses; depreciation; amortization; and other allocated costs.\nContingent Consideration\nThe contingent consideration liability is due to the issuance of the two tranches of restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs of E2open Holdings as part of the Business Combination. These shares and units were issued on a proportional basis to each holder of Class A shares in CCNB1 and Common Units. We also had deferred consideration (earn-out) payments that are due upon the successful attainment of revenue related criteria related to the Averetek, LLC (Averetek) acquisition.\nIn June 2021, the restricted Series B-1 common stock automatically converted into our Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis and the Series 1 RCUs automatically converted into Common Units of E2open Holdings as the Class A Common Stock met the $13.50 five-day VWAP. In July 2021, the deferred consideration due to Averetek was paid in full.\nThese restricted shares, Common Units and deferred consideration payments are treated as a contingent consideration liability under ASC 805 and valued at fair market value on the acquisition date and remeasured at each reporting date and adjusted if necessary. Our earn-out liabilities and contingent consideration are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. Any change in the fair value of the deferred consideration from the remeasurement was recorded in acquisition-related expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any change in the fair value of the restricted shares and Common Units from the remeasurement will be recorded in gain (loss) from change in fair value of contingent consideration on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, consists primarily of interest income on our cash balances; interest expense on our outstanding debt and financing lease obligations; foreign currency realized and unrealized gains and losses; and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of a deferred income tax benefit and current tax expense. The current income taxes primarily result from our profitable operations in foreign subsidiaries, which are subject to corporate income taxes in foreign jurisdictions, plus a relatively immaterial amount of U.S. federal and state income taxes on our lower tier entities not offset by net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred income tax benefit is primarily due to a decrease in overall outside basis difference in the partnership and the book/tax difference realized from intangible amortization. The deferred tax assets of certain other U.S corporate tax consolidated groups and non-U.S. jurisdictions remain offset by a valuation allowance. Realization of these deferred tax assets depends upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Utilization of our net operating losses may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRS Code), and similar state provisions. We have analyzed the effect of the IRS Code Section 382 for each of our acquisitions. Based on analysis of acquired net operating losses and credits, utilization of our net operating losses and research and development credits will be subject to annual limitations. In the event we have future changes in ownership, the availability of net operating loss carryforwards could be further limited.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table is our Consolidated

The increase in subscriptions revenue was primarily due to the BluJay Acquisition and new organic subscription sales predominantly driven by increases in products utilized across our client portfolio. These increases were partially offset by the $53.6 million amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination.

This increase was primarily related to the BluJay Acquisition, clients delaying projects in fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and new subscriptions sales resulting in favorable year-over-year growth.\nSubscriptions revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 79% for our fiscal year ending February 28, 2022 from 83% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.

The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the interest rate on the debt refinanced in the Business Combination in February 2021 as well as the reduction in outstanding debt for the first half of fiscal year 2022.

We have calculated the fair value of the tax receivable agreement payments and identified the timing of the utilization of the tax attributes. The tax receivable agreement liability, related to exchanges as of the Business Combination date, is revalued at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss as well as the associated interest reflected in change in tax receivable agreement liability in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the event occurred. We did not have a tax receivable agreement prior to the Business Combination.\nIn addition, under ASC 450, transactions with partnership unit holders after the acquisition date will result in additional Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities that are recorded on a gross undiscounted basis.

Importantly, although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed planned client engagements, we did not experience any material cancellations of engagements. Professional services and other revenue was also impacted by fewer new subscription sales closed in early fiscal 2021 as compared to the fiscal 2020. We attribute this temporary delay in closing new subscription sales to the COVID-19 pandemic as our clients were focused on the impact of the pandemic on their operations rather than launching new technology projects.\nOur subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 83% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to 80% for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 driven primarily by the increase in subscription revenue and decline in professional services and other revenue described above.\nCost of

This decrease is related primarily to the acquisition of Amber Road, stronger operating results, the $9.5 million unit-based compensation recognized in fiscal 2020 attributable to the acceleration of certain unit-based awards related to the Amber Road acquisition, additional integration-related cost savings realized from historical acquisitions, $23.2 million income for the fair value adjustment as of February 28, 2021 for the warrant liability and $33.7 million income associated with the fair value adjustment as of February 28, 2021 for the contingent consideration liability related to the Sponsor Side Letter and restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock. The benefits were partially offset by higher interest expense in fiscal 2020 due to incremental debt incurred to finance the Amber Road acquisition, $28.2 million of unit-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and $4.7 million of unit-based compensation expense for the restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination for the accelerated unvested options and restricted units.\nNotwithstanding that the $7.3 million income tax benefit is substantially the same for each period, the effective tax rate is 17.2% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, compared to 6.2%, for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The overall increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the relative change in state taxes, earnings at affiliate, changes in valuation allowances and changes due to the fair value of equity compensation related to the Business Combination.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis document includes Non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP subscriptions revenue, Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP performance measures that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry.\nWe calculate and define Non-GAAP revenue as revenue and subscriptions revenue excluding the impact of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination. We calculate and define Non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items. We define and calculate EBITDA as net income or losses excluding interest income or expense, income tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the following items: amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, transaction-related costs, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, (gain) loss from changes in the fair value of the warrant liability and contingent consideration, share-based compensation and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items as described in the reconciliation below. We also report Non-GAAP gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Non-GAAP revenue as additional measures to evaluate financial performance.\nWe include these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain expenses that are required in accordance with U.S. GAAP because they are non-recurring (for example, in the case of transaction-related costs and amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment), non-cash (for example, in the case of depreciation, amortization, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, (gain) loss from changes in the fair value of the warrant liability and contingent consideration, share-based compensation and amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment) or are not related to our underlying business performance (for example, in the case of interest income and expense). There are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in the U.S. GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from U.S. GAAP financial measures such as net income or loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe table below presents our Non-GAAP

EBITDA margins improved to 29% for combined fiscal 2021 compared to 6% in the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 32% for fiscal 2021 compared to 22% for fiscal 2020. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins were primarily related to the acquisition of Amber Road, stronger operating results and the realization of integration-related cost savings from historical acquisitions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital, capital expenditure needs, contractual obligations and other commitments, with cash flows from operations and other sources of funding. Current working capital needs relate mainly to employee compensation and benefits, as well as interest and debt. Our ability to expand and grow our business will depend on many factors, including working capital needs and the evolution of our operating cash flows.\nWe had $155.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $75.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2022. See Note 13, Notes Payable to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, the borrowing capacity under our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt repayment and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. On April 6, 2022, the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to include a $190.0 million incremental term loan. A portion of the proceeds were used to repay the $80.0 million outstanding balance under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing.\nDebt\n2021 Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility\nOn February 4, 2021, as part of the Business Combination, E2open, LLC, our subsidiary, entered into a $525.0 million term loan (2021 Term Loan) and a $75.0 million revolver (2021 Revolving Credit Facility). On September 1, 2021, as part of the BluJay Acquisition, the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to include a $380.0 million incremental term loan, an increase in the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility from $75.0 million to $155.0 million and an increase in the letter of credit sublimit from $15.0 million to $30.0 million.\nE2open, LLC can request increases in the revolving commitments and additional term loan facilities, in minimum amounts of $2.0 million for each facility. The Credit Agreement was payable in quarterly installments of $1.3 million beginning in August 2021; however, the payments were increased to $2.3 million with the addition of the incremental term loan beginning in November 2021. The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility will mature on February 4, 2026 and the Credit Agreement is payable in full on February 4, 2028.\nThe 2021 Term Loan has a variable interest rate which was LIBOR plus 350 basis points, with a 50 basis point floor, or 4.00% as of February 28, 2022 and 3.69% as of February 28, 2021. Principal payments of $2.3 million are due on the last day of each February, May, August and November. As of February 28, 2022 and 2021, the 2021 Term Loan had a principal balance outstanding of $899.2 million and $525.0 million, respectively. There were $80.0 million of borrowings outstanding at an interest rate of 5.25%, no outstanding letters of credit and $75.0 million available borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2022. The $80.0 million borrowings were used to fund the initial purchase price of the Logistyx acquisition. There were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2021.\nThe principal payment obligations under our notes payable as of February 28, 2022 were: $89.1 million for fiscal 2023, $9.1 million for fiscal 2024, $9.1 million for fiscal 2025, $9.1 million for fiscal 2026, $9.1 million for fiscal 2027 and $853.9 million thereafter.\nOn April 6, 2022, the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to include a $190.0 million incremental term loan. The proceeds were used to repay the $80.0 million outstanding balance under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility incurred to finance the initial purchase price payment for Logistyx. The additional cash provided us the cash needed to pay the remaining $95.0 million purchase price commitments for Logistyx, should we elect to pay cash in lieu of stock, and may be used for share repurchases or other general corporate purposes.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents net cash from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities:\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended February 28, 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 4, 2021\nthrough\nFebruary 28, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 1, 2020\nthrough\nFebruary 3, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\nEnded February 29, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55,847\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(808,508\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(467,275\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,990\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(442,962\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>710,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(468\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(98\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted\ncash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,988\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(461,901\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>621,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,960\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning\nof year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>669,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>669,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 (Successor) and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 (Predecessor)\nFor the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by approximately $32.9 million to $174.6 million as compared to our balance of $207.5 million as of February 28, 2021.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2022 was $51.2 million compared to $14.5 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in gross profit due to the BluJay Acquisition, new organic subscription sales, an increase in professional services due to clients delaying projects in fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, interest savings on our debt and an increase in cash provided by working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $808.5 million for fiscal year 2022 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $481.3 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities was attributed primarily to the acquisition of BluJay in September 2021. Capital expenditures mainly for the acquisition of property and software related to our data centers was $31.8 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to $15.5 million in the prior year. Additionally, we made a minority investment of $2.5 million in a private firm focused on supply chain financing.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2022 was $710.7 million compared to $626.0 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to additional debt of $117.0 million, net of offering costs, borrowed to finance the BluJay Acquisition. This increase in cash was offset by the repurchase of $2.5 million of common stock, the repurchase of $16.8 million of Common Units and the payment of $10.4 million of debt issuance costs in fiscal 2022. Additionally, we received $3.5 million in cash from the sale of membership units in fiscal 2021.\nFebruary 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 (Successor) and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 (Predecessor) compared to Fiscal year ended February 29, 2020\nAs of February 28, 2021, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $207.5 million, a $159.1 million increase from our balance of $48.4 million as of February 29, 2020, which as primarily due to the Business Combination.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 was $14.5 million compared to a use of cash of $55.8 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The $70.3 million difference was largely driven by the increase in EBITDA for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $481.3 million and $443.0 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 and fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, respectively. The use of cash for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods in 2021 was primarily driven by the Business Combination and acquisition of property and software related to our data centers while the use of cash for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 was primarily driven by the acquisition of Amber Road.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 was $626.0 million compared to $467.6 million for fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was a result of $158.3 million of cash received from the PIPE Investors above the additional borrowings in 2020 compared to 2021. Additionally, in 2020, we incurred debt issuance costs of $12.9 million. Debt issuance costs were incurred during the period from February 4 through February 28, 2021 as part of the Business Combination.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nConcurrently with the completion of the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with certain selling equity holders of E2open Holdings. The Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by the Company of 85% of certain tax benefits that are realized or deemed realized as a result of increases in tax, utilization of pre-existing tax attributes of certain sellers and realization of additional tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement for an amount representing the present value of anticipated future tax benefits under the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of the cash tax savings.\nAmounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be contingent upon, among other things, our generation of taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we would not be required to make the related payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Although the amount of any payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be significant, the timing of these payments will vary and will generally be limited to one payment per member per year.\nThe liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement was $66.6 million and $50.1 million as of February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively, assuming (1) a constant corporate tax rate of 24.1%, (2) no dispositions of corporate subsidiaries, (3) no material changes in tax law and (4) we do not elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, due to the uncertainty of various factors, including: (a) the timing and value of future exchanges, (b) the amount and timing of our future taxable income, (c) changes in our tax rate, (d) no future dispositions of any corporate stock, (e) changes in the tax law and (f) changes in the discount rate, the likely tax savings we will realize and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay to the E2open Sellers pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement are uncertain. Additionally, interest will accrue on the portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability recorded under ASC 805 at a rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability under ASC 450 is recorded on a gross undiscounted basis.\nThe liability recorded on the balance sheet does not include an estimate of the amount of payments to be made if certain sellers exchanged their remaining interests in E2open Holdings for our common stock, as this amount is not readily determinable and is dependent on several future variables, including timing of future exchanges, stock price at date of exchange, tax attributes of the individual parties to the exchange and changes in future applicable federal and state tax rates.\nIn addition, if we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur, we will be required to make immediate cash payments. Such cash payments will be equal to the present value of the assumed future realized tax benefits based on a set of assumptions and using an agreed upon discount rate, as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement. The early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of those future tax benefits. Such payments will be calculated based on certain assumptions, including that we have sufficient taxable income to utilize the full amount of any tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement over the period specified therein. The payments that we will be required to make will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us, but we expect the cash tax savings we will realize from the utilization of the related tax benefits will exceed the amount of any required payments.\nWe are entitled to receive quarterly tax distributions from E2open Holdings, subject to limitations imposed by applicable law and contractual restrictions. The cash received from such tax distributions will first be used by us to satisfy any tax liability and then make any payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect that such tax distributions will be sufficient to fund both our tax liability and the required payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, we expect future gross payments during the fiscal years ending February 2024 of $2.7 million, 2025 of $8.4 million, 2026 of $8.0 million, 2027 of $7.3 million and thereafter of $85.4 million.\nWarrant Liability\nAs of February 28, 2022 and 2021, there were an aggregate of 29,079,872 and 29,079,972 warrants outstanding, respectively, which include the public warrants, private placement warrants and forward purchase warrants. Each warrant entitles its holders to purchase one share of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The warrants are recorded as a liability in warrant liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a balance of $67.1 million and $68.8 million as of February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 and period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021, a gain of $1.6 million and $23.2 million was recognized in gain from change in fair value of the warrant liability in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, 100 warrants were exercised with a total exercise price of $1,150.\nConversion of Contingent Consideration\nThe contingent consideration liability was $45.6 million and $150.8 million as of February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value remeasurements resulted in a loss of $69.8 million and a gain of $33.7 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 and the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021, respectively. There was no gain or loss for the period from March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 and the year ended February 29, 2020 as the underlying equity was not issued until February 4, 2021. The contingent liability represents the Series B-1 common stock, Series B-2 common stock, Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs.\nAs of June 8, 2021, the Series B-1 common stock and Series 1 RCUs were no longer reflected as a contingent consideration liability as the 5-day VWAP of our Class A Common Stock exceeded $13.50 per share. This triggering event resulted in the 8,120,273 Series B-1 common stock converting into Class A Common Stock and 4,379,557 Series 1 RCUs becoming 4,379,557 Common Units of E2open Holdings along with entitling the holders of the newly vested Common Units to 4,379,557 shares of Class V Common Stock.\nLogistyx Acquisition\nOn March 2, 2022, E2open, LLC acquired Logistyx Technologies, LLC for a purchase price of $185 million, with an estimated fair value of $183.7 million, including $90 million paid in cash at closing. An additional $95 million will be paid in two installments on May 31, 2022 and August 29, 2022. We have the option to finance the remaining payments, at our discretion, through cash or a combination of cash and Class A Common Stock. The May 31, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $5.0 million in cash with the total payment equal to $37.4 million. The August 29, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $26.1 million in cash with the total payment equal to $57.6 million.\nInvestments\nOn February 4, 2022, we made a minority investment of $2.5 million in a private firm focused on supply chain financing. We are required to invest an additional $2.5 million 90 days from February 4, 2022.\nLeases\nEffective March 1, 2021, we began accounting for leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets on the balance sheet for contracts that provide lessees with the right to control the use of identified assets for periods of greater than 12 months. Upon adoption of ASC 842, we recognized an operating lease liability of $23.0 million, a ROU operating asset of $22.4 million and no change to retained earnings.\nOur non-cancelable operating leases for our office spaces have various expiration dates through August 2029. Under these leases, our undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the calculation of the lease liabilities as of February 28, 2022 were: $8.5 million for fiscal 2023, $7.3 million for fiscal 2024, $5.6 million for fiscal 2025, $4.0 million for fiscal 2026, $3.0 million for fiscal 2027 and $2.7 million thereafter. These numbers include interest of $2.3 million.\nOur non-cancelable financing lease arrangements relate to software and computer equipment and have various expiration dates through August 2024. We have the right to purchase the software and computer equipment anytime during the lease or upon lease completion. Under these leases, our undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the calculation of the lease liabilities as of February 28, 2022 were: $2.4 million for fiscal 2023 and $2.1 million for fiscal 2024. These numbers include interest of $0.2 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amount of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nSubscription revenue, which primarily consists of fees to provide clients cloud-based access to our solution, is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. Subscription revenue includes logistics as a service which employs logistics professionals to manage a company's transportation network including truck, rail, ocean and air freight as well as inbound/outbound logistics from production facilities to warehouses, retailers and end users/consumers. Typically, amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Transaction-related revenue is recognized as the transactions occur.\nProfessional services revenue is derived primarily from fees for enabling services, including solution consulting and solution deployment. These services are often sold in conjunction with the sale of our solutions. We provide professional services primarily on a time and materials basis, but sometimes on a fixed fee basis. Professional services revenue is recognized as the services are provided. For services that are contracted at a fixed price, progress is generally measured based on labor hours incurred as a percentage of the total estimated hours required for complete satisfaction of the related performance obligations. For services that are contracted on time and materials or prepaid basis, progress is generally based on actual labor hours expended. These input methods (e.g., hours incurred or expended and milestones completed) are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy services contracts as they represent the performance obligation consumed by the client and performed by us, and therefore reflect the transfer of services to a client under such contracts.\nIf our estimate of the total hours required for a performance obligation at a fixed price is inaccurate, then our revenue recognition timing will be impacted as labor hours as a percentage of total estimated hours will be adjusted at the end of the contract resulting in additional or reduced revenue recognized, as needed, to account for the change in hours. We adjust our estimated total hours and the appropriate revenue recognition each month. Any adjustments should not have a material impact to our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations, comprising of subscriptions and professional services. Arrangements with clients typically do not provide the client with the right to take possession of the software supporting the on-demand solutions. We primarily account for subscription and professional services revenue as separate units of accounting and allocate revenue to each deliverable in an arrangement based on standalone selling price. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. We evaluate the standalone selling price for each element by considering prices we charge for similar offerings, size of the order and historical pricing practices. If our judgment is incorrect for a particular item within an arrangement, the timing of our revenue could be impacted between periods such that we would recognize revenue in a different period than we would have if a different judgment had been used; however, the revenue for the full arrangement would have the same result.\nOther revenue primarily includes license fees and travel expenses for services rendered. Other revenue is recognized when the service is delivered to the client.\nDeferred revenue from subscriptions represents amounts collected from, or invoiced to, clients in advance of earning subscription revenue. Typically, we bill our annual subscription fees in advance of providing the service. Deferred revenue from professional services represents revenue for time and material contracts where the revenue is recognized when milestones are achieved and accepted by the client for fixed price contracts.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards at fair value over the requisite service period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of options. The input variable for the Black-Scholes model are the expected life of the option, volatility of our peer group and our common stock, risk free rate of return and expected dividend yield. For restricted stock grants and certain performance-based awards, fair value is determined as the average price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. The determination of fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.\nThe expected terms of the options are based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at grant date. Volatility is based on historical and expected future volatility of our Class A Common Stock. We have not historically issued any dividends and do not expect to in the future.\nFor performance-based awards where the number of shares includes a relative revenue growth modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period, the number of shares earned will depend on which range our total revenue growth falls within over the performance period. The fair value of the performance-based shares with the revenue growth modifier is determined using an intrinsic value model. In the period it becomes probable that the minimum threshold specified in the performance-based award will be achieved, we will recognize expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the award related to the vesting period that has already lapsed. The remaining fair value of the award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the balance of the vesting period. If we determine that it is no longer probable that we will achieve the minimum performance threshold specified in the award, all of the previously recognized compensation expense will be reversed in the period such determination is made.\nWe do not estimate forfeitures; therefore, we record compensation costs for all awards and record forfeitures as they occur.\nIf factors change and we employ different assumptions in the determination of the fair value of grants in future periods, the related compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current or past periods.\nRefer to Note 23, Share-Based and Unit-Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our share-based compensation plans.\nUnit-Based Compensation\nThe pre-Business Combination unit-based compensation expense associated with awards to employees and directors was measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards that were expected to vest. For time based awards, the expense was recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which was generally four years. For performance based awards, the expense was recognized when the performance obligation was probable of occurring. The fair value of options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was impacted by the following assumptions:\n\u2022Expected Term - We estimated the expected term, using the simplified method due to limited exercise data, to be the period of time between the date of grant and the midpoint between option vesting and expiration.\n\u2022Expected Volatility - As E2open Holdings' units were not actively traded, the volatility is based on a benchmark of comparable companies within the SCM software industry.\n\u2022Expected Dividend Yield - The dividend rate used was zero as we did not pay any cash dividends to unit holders.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate - The interest rates used were based on the implied yield available on constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities with a term equal to the expected term of the options.\nThe pre-Business Combination grant date fair value of our common stock was typically determined by our board of members with the assistance of management and a third-party valuation specialist. The grant date fair value of our membership units was determined using valuation methodologies which utilized certain assumptions and weighting of factors, including an income based approach, a market based approach and an assumption for a discount for lack of marketability. Application of these valuation methodologies involved the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, cash flows, discount rates, market multiples and the selection of comparable companies.\nWe did not estimate forfeitures. Instead, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Forfeitures were not material for the periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 and fiscal years ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019.\nWarrant Liability\nWe have public and private placement warrants as well as warrants available under the Forward Purchase Agreement. We classify as equity any equity-linked contracts that (1) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (2) give us a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in our own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). We classify as assets or liabilities any equity-linked contracts that (1) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside our control) or (2) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement).\nFor equity-linked contracts that are classified as liabilities, we record the fair value of the equity-linked contract at each balance sheet date and record the change in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a gain (loss) from change in fair value of warrant liability. Our public warrant liability is valued using the binomial lattice pricing model. Our private placement warrants are valued using a binomial pricing model when the warrants are subject to the make-whole table, or otherwise are valued using a Black-Scholes pricing model. Our Forward Purchase Warrants are valued utilizing observable market prices for public shares and warrants, relative to the present value of contractual cash proceeds. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend rate, expiration dates and risk-free rates.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of our warrant liability changes at each balance sheet date are based on our stock price and other assumptions described above. If our assumptions change or we experience significant volatility in our stock price or interest rates, the fair value calculated from one balance sheet period to the next could be materially different.\nContingent Consideration\nThe contingent consideration liability is due to the issuance of the two tranches of restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs of E2open Holdings as part of the Business Combination. These shares and units were issued on a proportional basis to each holder of Class A shares in CCNB1 and Common Units of E2open Holdings. We also had deferred consideration (earn-out) payments that were due upon the successful attainment of revenue related criteria related to the acquisition of Averetek.\nIn June 2021, the restricted Series B-1 common stock automatically converted into our Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis and the Series 1 RCUs automatically converted into Common Units of E2open Holdings. In July 2021, the deferred consideration due to Averetek was paid in full.\nThese restricted shares, Common Units and deferred consideration payments are treated as a contingent consideration liability under ASC 805 and valued at fair market value on the acquisition date and will be remeasured at each reporting date and adjusted if necessary. Our earn-out liabilities and contingent consideration are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend rates, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. Any change in the fair value of the deferred consideration from the remeasurement will be recorded in acquisition-related expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any change in the fair value of the restricted shares and Common Units from the remeasurement will be recorded in gain (loss) from change in fair value of contingent consideration on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of our contingent consideration changes at each balance sheet date based on our stock price, operating results and other assumptions. If our assumptions change or we experience significant volatility in our stock price or interest rates, the fair value calculated from one balance sheet period to the next could be materially different.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that, in the opinion of management, is more likely than not to be realized.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognizable tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nJudgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe evaluate acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the test is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the test is not met, further determination is required as to whether or not we have acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs which would meet the definition of a business. Significant judgment is required in the application of the test to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets.\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nDetermining estimated fair value requires a significant amount of judgment and estimates. If our assumptions change or errors are determined in our calculations, the fair value could materially change resulting in a change in our goodwill or identifiable net assets acquired.\nRecently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis item contains a discussion of our business, including a general overview of our business, properties, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page 73. This Item 7 contains forward-looking\u201d statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur fiscal year end is the final day in February. Our fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 ended February 28, 2022, February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively, and were each fifty-two-week periods.\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of cloud-based, end-to-end SCM software. Our platform spans many key strategic and operational areas including omni-channel, demand sensing, supply planning, global trade management, transportation and logistics and manufacturing and supply management. Our software combines networks, data and applications to provide a deeply embedded, mission-critical platform that allows clients to optimize their channel and supply chains by accelerating growth, reducing costs, increasing visibility and driving improved resiliency. Given the mission-critical nature of our solutions, we maintain long-term relationships with our clients, which is reflected by our high gross retention and long client tenure. In aggregate, we serve approximately 6,000 clients in all major countries in the world across a wide range of end-markets, including consumer goods, food and beverage, manufacturing, retail, technology and transportation, among others. Our large enterprise clients represent approximately 600 of our clients and are those who, when aggregated to their parent company, report greater than $1 billion in annual revenue and generate $50,000 or more of our annual subscriptions revenue.\nWe operate in what we believe is an attractive industry with strong secular tailwinds and a TAM of more than $54 billion. This TAM is comprised of significant whitespace, which we estimate to be in excess of $1 billion just within our current client base. This upsell opportunity within our existing client base is largely driven by their current technology solution which is often a combination of legacy point solutions and home-grown applications, which are tied together with manual processes and spreadsheets. As manufacturing has evolved from brands owning the full production lifecycle to orchestrating disparate manufacturing, distribution and selling processes conducted across multiple geographies, supply chains have grown more complex, increasing demand for software solutions like ours and the need to modernize the existing technology landscape with cloud-based modern solutions. We believe our fully cloud-based, end-to-end software platform offers a more connected solution for clients that gives them better value as compared to solutions offered by some of our competitors.\nOur Go-To-Market Strategy\nOur go-to-market strategy is focused on both expanding the adoption of our product portfolio with existing clients and the acquisition of new clients. We primarily focus our selling efforts on large enterprise organizations and sell our software primarily through a direct sales force and are expanding our go-to-market presence with partners. Our go-to-market strategy enables our sales force to develop deep, long-term relationships with existing and potential clients across the relevant functions, from buying managers, IT resources, division leaders and C-level executives. Importantly, we believe that our go-to-market approach focused on clients is a competitive advantage compared to competitors whose go-to-market approach is often focused on products, as our clients have one seller who owns the relationship irrespective of the product of interest. We believe this enables us to sustain our high client retention and long client tenure as well as drive maximum spend within each client through an efficient sales model.\nOur sales and marketing organizations are comprised of field sales, inside sales and sales development personnel, and we align these teams based on client size and industry. We focus initially on solving a client's primary need, usually a specific piece of their supply chain. Once a client adopts our solution and witnesses the power of our unique platform, we focus on cross-selling additional products as well as expanding into additional departments, divisions and geographies with the same solution. We have found that experience with our SaaS platform is the most effective selling tool.\nThe Business Combination\nOn February 4, 2021, E2open Holdings and CCNB1 completed the Business Combination contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, CCNB1 acquired a majority interest in E2open Holdings through a series of mergers, with E2open Holdings becoming a direct subsidiary of CCNB1. In connection with the completion of the Business Combination, CCNB1 changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware and changed its name to E2open Parent Holdings, Inc.\u201d\nUpon completion of the Business Combination, CCNB1 was deemed the accounting acquirer and E2open the accounting acquiree. Under the acquisition method of accounting, CCNB1's assets and liabilities retained their carrying values and the assets and liabilities associated with E2open Holdings were recorded at their fair values measured as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The cash consideration in the Business Combination included cash from (1) the Trust Account in the amount of $414.0 million, (2) $525.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of a new term loan, (3) $695.0 million in proceeds from the PIPE Investment and (4) $200.0 million in proceeds from Forward Purchase Agreement. These proceeds were used to pay (x) $601.1 million in cash consideration payable to certain equity owners and option holders of E2open Holdings, including certain non-recurring seller transaction expenses, (y) $978.5 million of existing E2open debt and accrued interest and (z) total non-recurring transaction costs of $105.2 million. The non-recurring transaction costs included acquisition-related advisory fees in connection with the Business Combination, deferred underwriting commissions in connection with CCNB1's IPO and debt issuance costs related to the new credit agreement entered into in connection with the Business Combination but excluded certain seller costs to be paid by the equity owners of E2open Holdings. The deferred underwriting commissions and costs pertaining to the reverse merger were treated as a reduction of equity while merger-related costs were expensed in the period in which the Business Combination closed. The debt issuance costs were capitalized as a reduction to the outstanding debt balances. In addition, certain options to purchase equity interests in E2open Holdings were accelerated upon the Closing Date, which resulted in a non-recurring expense of approximately $28.2 million in the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021. Additionally, unit-based compensation expense of $4.7 million was recognized during the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 related to the restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination for the accelerated unvested options and restricted units.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, our prior year financial results are broken out between the Predecessor period (March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021) and the Successor period (February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021).\nBluJay Acquisition\nOn September 1, 2021, we completed the BluJay Acquisition with the issuance of 72,383,299 shares of Class A Common Stock to the BluJay Sellers and the payment of approximately $771.3 million of cash which includes the repayment of BluJay's debt facility. The total purchase consideration for the BluJay Acquisition was $1.5 billion.\nIn connection with the completion of the BluJay Acquisition, we secured $300 million in PIPE financing from institutional investors for the purchase of an aggregate of 28,909,022 shares of our Class A Common Stock. We also obtained a $380.0 million incremental term loan to our 2021 Term Loan and increased our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility by $80.0 million to $155.0 million. In addition, the letter of credit sublimit was increased from $15.0 million to $30.0 million upon completion of the BluJay Acquisition.\nAdditionally, the Investor Rights Agreement was amended and restated to add certain of BluJay's existing stockholders as parties, including certain affiliates of Francisco Partners and Temasek as well as include a six month lock-up period from September 1, 2021 through February 28, 2022 for certain equity holders of E2open and BluJay. The Investor Rights Agreement also provided Francisco Partners and Temasek the right to nominate one member each to our board of directors. Mr. Deep Shah and Mr. Martin Fichtner became new directors on September 1, 2021.\nLogistyx Acquisition\nOn March 2, 2022, we acquired Logistyx for a purchase price of $185 million, with an estimated fair value of $183.7 million, including $90 million paid in cash at closing. An additional $95 million will be paid in two installments on May 31, 2022 and August 29, 2022. We have the option to fulfill the remaining payments, at our discretion, through cash or a combination of cash and our Class A Common Stock. The May 31, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $5.0 million in cash with the total payment equal to $37.4 million. The August 29, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $26.1 million in cash with the total payment equal to $57.6 million.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused business disruptions worldwide beginning in January 2020. The full extent to which the pandemic will impact our business, operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments that are difficult to accurately predict. We have experienced modest adverse impacts as it relates to lengthening of sales cycles and delays in delivering professional services and training to our clients, primarily in our fiscal 2021 period. However, the delays have resulted in operational savings related in such areas as travel and entertainment, marketing expenses due to virtual versus in-person events and facility costs resulting from the move to a remote workforce. Those savings continued throughout most of our fiscal 2022 year.\nAlthough parts of our business have seemingly returned to pre-pandemic levels, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge in various areas of the world demonstrating that the impact of the pandemic is not yet complete. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we are carefully monitoring the situation to understand its impacts on our business and operations.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe account for all client contracts under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), and all the related amendments. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions and professional services. We recognize revenue when the client contract and associated performance obligations have been identified; the transaction price has been determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract; and the performance obligations have been satisfied.\nSubscription Revenue\nWe offer cloud-based on-demand software solutions, which enable our clients to have constant access to our solutions without the need to manage and support the software and associated hardware themselves. We house the hardware and software in third-party facilities and provide our clients with access to the software solutions, along with data security and storage, backup, recovery services and solution support. Logistics as a service employs logistics professionals to manage a company's transportation network including truck, rail, ocean and air freight as well as inbound/outbound logistics from production facilities to warehouses, retailers and end users/consumers. Our client contracts typically have a term of three to five years, and we recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contracts.\nWe charge primarily fixed annual subscription fees or, in limited cases, transaction fees based on the volume of transactions requested by clients. Typically, the volume-based fees are for small clients and comprise a small percentage of this revenue source.\nFor subscription-based contracts, we generally invoice annually in advance. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. For transactional based contracts, we primarily recognize revenue for these contracts when the performance obligation is fulfilled. Transaction based contracts represented less than 3% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 and the combined Successor and Predecessor periods in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nProfessional Services and Other\nProfessional services revenue is derived primarily from fees for enabling services, including consulting and deployment services for purchased solutions. These services are often sold in conjunction with the sale of our solutions. We provide professional services primarily on a time and materials basis, but sometimes on a fixed fee basis. Clients are invoiced for professional services either monthly in arrears or, as with fixed fee arrangements, in advance and upon reaching project milestones. Professional services revenue is recognized over time. For services that are contracted at a fixed price, progress is generally measured based on labor hours incurred as a percentage of the total estimated hours required for complete satisfaction of the related performance obligations. For services that are contracted on time and materials or a prepaid basis, progress is generally based on actual labor hours expended. These input methods (e.g., hours incurred or expended and milestone completion) are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy services contracts as they represent the performance obligation consumed by the client and performed by us, and therefore reflect the transfer of services to a client under contract.\nWe enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations comprised of subscriptions and professional services. Arrangements with clients typically do not provide the client with the right to take possession of the software supporting the on-demand solutions. We primarily account for subscription and professional services revenue as separate units of accounting and allocate revenue to each deliverable in an arrangement based on a standalone selling price. We evaluate the standalone selling price for each element by considering prices we charge for similar offerings, size of the order and historical pricing practices.\nOther revenue primarily includes license fees and travel expenses for services rendered. Other revenue is recognized when the service is delivered to the client.\nTotal Revenue by Geographic Locations\nRevenues by geographical region consisted of the following:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended February 28, 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 4, 2021\nthrough\nFebruary 28, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 1, 2020\nthrough\nFebruary 3, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\nEnded February 29, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>366,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>305,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of our contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the client, or where the software solutions are being utilized or accessed. Americas revenue was approximately 86%, 96%, 96% and 96% during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 and fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during these periods.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Subscription Revenue\nCost of subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to delivering our service and providing support to clients, including personnel and related costs, costs associated with data center operations and capacity, fees paid to third parties to license their technology and depreciation expense directly related to delivering our solutions. Cost of subscription revenue also includes the costs associated with our logistics as a service revenue which consists of costs related to managing a company's transportation network including truck, rail, ocean and air freight as well as inbound/outbound logistics from production facilities to warehouses, retailers and end users/consumers. We generally expense our cost of subscription revenue as we incur the costs.\nCost of Professional Services and Other Revenue\nCost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel and related travel costs, the costs of contracted third-party vendors and reimbursable expenses. As our personnel are employed on a full-time basis, our cost of professional services is largely fixed in the short-term, while our professional services and other revenue may fluctuate, leading to fluctuations in professional services and other gross profit. We expense our cost of professional services and other revenue as we incur the costs.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs of our research and development staff, costs of certain third-party contractors, depreciation, amortization and other allocated costs. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred, excluding the capitalization of internally developed software costs.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our sales and marketing staff. It also includes the costs of promotional events, corporate communications, online marketing, solution marketing and other brand-building activities, in addition to depreciation, amortization and other allocated costs. When the initial client contract is signed and upon any renewal, we capitalize and amortize commission costs under ASC 606, as an expense over the period in which products are expected to be delivered to clients, where the commission is directly attributable to a contract, including expected renewals, which is estimated to be four years. If a subscription agreement is terminated, we recognize the unamortized portion of any deferred commission cost as an expense immediately upon such termination. Certain sales commissions are contingent on future client billings and are expensed as incurred to sales and marketing expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our executive, administrative, finance, information technology, legal, accounting, investor relations and human resource staff. It also includes professional fees; expenses related to our board of directors; public company costs; other corporate expenses; depreciation; amortization; and other allocated costs.\nContingent Consideration\nThe contingent consideration liability is due to the issuance of the two tranches of restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs of E2open Holdings as part of the Business Combination. These shares and units were issued on a proportional basis to each holder of Class A shares in CCNB1 and Common Units. We also had deferred consideration (earn-out) payments that are due upon the successful attainment of revenue related criteria related to the Averetek, LLC (Averetek) acquisition.\nIn June 2021, the restricted Series B-1 common stock automatically converted into our Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis and the Series 1 RCUs automatically converted into Common Units of E2open Holdings as the Class A Common Stock met the $13.50 five-day VWAP. In July 2021, the deferred consideration due to Averetek was paid in full.\nThese restricted shares, Common Units and deferred consideration payments are treated as a contingent consideration liability under ASC 805 and valued at fair market value on the acquisition date and remeasured at each reporting date and adjusted if necessary. Our earn-out liabilities and contingent consideration are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. Any change in the fair value of the deferred consideration from the remeasurement was recorded in acquisition-related expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any change in the fair value of the restricted shares and Common Units from the remeasurement will be recorded in gain (loss) from change in fair value of contingent consideration on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, consists primarily of interest income on our cash balances; interest expense on our outstanding debt and financing lease obligations; foreign currency realized and unrealized gains and losses; and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of a deferred income tax benefit and current tax expense. The current income taxes primarily result from our profitable operations in foreign subsidiaries, which are subject to corporate income taxes in foreign jurisdictions, plus a relatively immaterial amount of U.S. federal and state income taxes on our lower tier entities not offset by net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred income tax benefit is primarily due to a decrease in overall outside basis difference in the partnership and the book/tax difference realized from intangible amortization. The deferred tax assets of certain other U.S corporate tax consolidated groups and non-U.S. jurisdictions remain offset by a valuation allowance. Realization of these deferred tax assets depends upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Utilization of our net operating losses may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRS Code), and similar state provisions. We have analyzed the effect of the IRS Code Section 382 for each of our acquisitions. Based on analysis of acquired net operating losses and credits, utilization of our net operating losses and research and development credits will be subject to annual limitations. In the event we have future changes in ownership, the availability of net operating loss carryforwards could be further limited.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table is our Consolidated

The increase in subscriptions revenue was primarily due to the BluJay Acquisition and new organic subscription sales predominantly driven by increases in products utilized across our client portfolio. These increases were partially offset by the $53.6 million amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination. With the early adoption of ASU 2021-08, a fair value adjustment to deferred revenue for the BluJay Acquisition was not required nor recorded; therefore, amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue similar to the Business Combination adjustment will not occur for the BluJay Acquisition or subsequent acquisitions.\nProfessional services and other revenue was $90.0 million in fiscal year 2022, a $33.8 million, or 60%, increase compared to $56.2 million the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. This increase was primarily related to the BluJay Acquisition, clients delaying projects in fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and new subscriptions sales resulting in favorable year-over-year growth.\nSubscriptions revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 79% for our fiscal year ending February 28, 2022 from 83% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. This decrease was primarily related to the amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination and the increase in

The tax receivable agreement liability, related to exchanges as of the Business Combination date, is revalued at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss as well as the associated interest reflected in change in tax receivable agreement liability in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the event occurred. We did not have a tax receivable agreement prior to the Business Combination.\nIn addition, under ASC 450, transactions with partnership unit holders after the acquisition date will result in additional Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities that are recorded on a gross undiscounted basis.

The increase is primarily related to the $45.7 million acquisition related expenses for the BluJay Acquisition, a $13.8 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets, a $21.6 million change in the gain on the fair value adjustment for the warrant liability, an increased loss of $103.5 million associated with the fair value adjustment for the contingent consideration liability related to the Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and a $45.8 million increase in amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination compared to fiscal year 2021. These expenses were partially offset by $33.7 million of lower interest expense in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021.\nThe income tax benefit was $30.1 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $7.3 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The change was primarily due to an increase in loss from continuing operations included in the tax provision for fiscal 2022 that resulted in a decrease in the overall basis difference in the partnership. This benefit was partially offset by nondeductible mark-to-market losses associated with contingent liabilities and certain equity consideration liabilities and changes in valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions within which we operate as well as the impact to fiscal 2022 of losses attributable to our noncontrolling interest in our affiliate. In accordance with ASC 740-20-45-11, we accounted for the tax effect of the step-up in income tax basis related to transactions with or among shareholders and recognized a deferred tax asset and corresponding increase in stockholders' equity of $36.8 million.\nFebruary 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 (Successor) and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 (Predecessor) compared to Fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 (Predecessor)\nThe comparability of our operating results for the periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 as compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 was impacted by the Business Combination in February 2021 and the acquisition of Amber Road in July 2019.

The increase in subscription revenue was primarily related to the acquisition of Amber Road. The balance of the increase was primarily related to new organic subscription sales in the prior periods, predominantly driven by increases in products utilized across our client portfolio.\nProfessional services and other revenue was $56.2 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $4.9 million, or 8%, decrease compared to $61.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which delayed the delivery of professional services and training to our clients, mainly due to our clients' focus on switching to remote operations during the first half of fiscal 2021, which began on March 1, 2021. Importantly, although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed planned client engagements, we did not experience any material cancellations of engagements. Professional services and other revenue was also impacted by fewer new subscription sales closed in early fiscal 2021 as compared to the fiscal 2020. We attribute this temporary delay in closing new subscription sales to the COVID-19 pandemic as our clients were focused on the impact of the pandemic on their operations rather than launching new technology projects.\nOur subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 83% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021

This decrease is related primarily to the acquisition of Amber Road, stronger operating results, the $9.5 million unit-based compensation recognized in fiscal 2020 attributable to the acceleration of certain unit-based awards related to the Amber Road acquisition, additional integration-related cost savings realized from historical acquisitions, $23.2 million income for the fair value adjustment as of February 28, 2021 for the warrant liability and $33.7 million income associated with the fair value adjustment as of February 28, 2021 for the contingent consideration liability related to the Sponsor Side Letter and restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock. The benefits were partially offset by higher interest expense in fiscal 2020 due to incremental debt incurred to finance the Amber Road acquisition, $28.2 million of unit-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and $4.7 million of unit-based compensation expense for the restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination for the accelerated unvested options and restricted units.\nNotwithstanding that the $7.3 million income tax benefit is substantially the same for each period, the effective tax rate is 17.2% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, compared to 6.2%, for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The overall increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the relative change in state taxes, earnings at affiliate, changes in valuation allowances and changes due to the fair value of equity compensation related to the Business Combination.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis document includes Non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP subscriptions revenue, Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP performance measures that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry.\nWe calculate and define Non-GAAP revenue as revenue and subscriptions revenue excluding the impact of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination. We calculate and define Non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items. We define and calculate EBITDA as net income or losses excluding interest income or expense, income tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the following items: amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, transaction-related costs, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, (gain) loss from changes in the fair value of the warrant liability and contingent consideration, share-based compensation and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items as described in the reconciliation below. We also report Non-GAAP gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Non-GAAP revenue as additional measures to evaluate financial performance.\nWe include these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain expenses that are required in accordance with U.S. GAAP because they are non-recurring (for example, in the case of transaction-related costs and amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment), non-cash (for example, in the case of depreciation, amortization, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, (gain) loss from changes in the fair value of the warrant liability and contingent consideration, share-based compensation and amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment) or are not related to our underlying business performance (for example, in the case of interest income and expense). There are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in the U.S. GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from U.S. GAAP financial measures such as net income or loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe table below presents our Non-GAAP

These higher expenses were partially offset by a gain of $1.6 million for the fair value adjustment for the warrant liability and $29.8 million of lower share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2022 due to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination in February 2021 and higher revenues in fiscal 2022.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended February 28, 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 4, 2021\nthrough\nFebruary 28, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 1, 2020\nthrough\nFebruary 3, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Change represents the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $162.5 million for fiscal year 2022, a $53.0 million, or 48%, increase compared to $109.5 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.

The additional cash provided us the cash needed to pay the remaining $95.0 million purchase price commitments for Logistyx, should we elect to pay cash in lieu of stock, and may be used for share repurchases or other general corporate purposes.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents net cash from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities:\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended February 28, 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 4, 2021\nthrough\nFebruary 28, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 1, 2020\nthrough\nFebruary 3, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\nEnded February 29, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55,847\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(808,508\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(467,275\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,990\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(442,962\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>710,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(468\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>467,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(98\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted\ncash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,988\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(461,901\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>621,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,960\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning\nof year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>669,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>669,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 (Successor) and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 (Predecessor)\nFor the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by approximately $32.9 million to $174.6 million as compared to our balance of $207.5 million as of February 28, 2021.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2022 was $51.2 million compared to $14.5 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in gross profit due to the BluJay Acquisition, new organic subscription sales, an increase in professional services due to clients delaying projects in fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, interest savings on our debt and an increase in cash provided by working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $808.5 million for fiscal year 2022 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $481.3 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities was attributed primarily to the acquisition of BluJay in September 2021. Capital expenditures mainly for the acquisition of property and software related to our data centers was $31.8 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to $15.5 million in the prior year. Additionally, we made a minority investment of $2.5 million in a private firm focused on supply chain financing.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2022 was $710.7 million compared to $626.0 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to additional debt of $117.0 million, net of offering costs, borrowed to finance the BluJay Acquisition. This increase in cash was offset by the repurchase of $2.5 million of common stock, the repurchase of $16.8 million of Common Units and the payment of $10.4 million of debt issuance costs in fiscal 2022. Additionally, we received $3.5 million in cash from the sale of membership units in fiscal 2021.\nFebruary 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 (Successor) and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 (Predecessor) compared to Fiscal year ended February 29, 2020\nAs of February 28, 2021, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $207.5 million, a $159.1 million increase from our balance of $48.4 million as of February 29, 2020, which as primarily due to the Business Combination.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 was $14.5 million compared to a use of cash of $55.8 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The $70.3 million difference was largely driven by the increase in EBITDA for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $481.3 million and $443.0 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 and fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, respectively. The use of cash for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods in 2021 was primarily driven by the Business Combination and acquisition of property and software related to our data centers while the use of cash for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 was primarily driven by the acquisition of Amber Road.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 was $626.0 million compared to $467.6 million for fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was a result of $158.3 million of cash received from the PIPE Investors above the additional borrowings in 2020 compared to 2021. Additionally, in 2020, we incurred debt issuance costs of $12.9 million. Debt issuance costs were incurred during the period from February 4 through February 28, 2021 as part of the Business Combination.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nConcurrently with the completion of the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with certain selling equity holders of E2open Holdings. The Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by the Company of 85% of certain tax benefits that are realized or deemed realized as a result of increases in tax, utilization of pre-existing tax attributes of certain sellers and realization of additional tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement for an amount representing the present value of anticipated future tax benefits under the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of the cash tax savings.\nAmounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be contingent upon, among other things, our generation of taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we would not be required to make the related payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Although the amount of any payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be significant, the timing of these payments will vary and will generally be limited to one payment per member per year.\nThe liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement was $66.6 million and $50.1 million as of February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively, assuming (1) a constant corporate tax rate of 24.1%, (2) no dispositions of corporate subsidiaries, (3) no material changes in tax law and (4) we do not elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, due to the uncertainty of various factors, including: (a) the timing and value of future exchanges, (b) the amount and timing of our future taxable income, (c) changes in our tax rate, (d) no future dispositions of any corporate stock, (e) changes in the tax law and (f) changes in the discount rate, the likely tax savings we will realize and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay to the E2open Sellers pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement are uncertain. Additionally, interest will accrue on the portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability recorded under ASC 805 at a rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability under ASC 450 is recorded on a gross undiscounted basis.\nThe liability recorded on the balance sheet does not include an estimate of the amount of payments to be made if certain sellers exchanged their remaining interests in E2open Holdings for our common stock, as this amount is not readily determinable and is dependent on several future variables, including timing of future exchanges, stock price at date of exchange, tax attributes of the individual parties to the exchange and changes in future applicable federal and state tax rates.\nIn addition, if we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur, we will be required to make immediate cash payments. Such cash payments will be equal to the present value of the assumed future realized tax benefits based on a set of assumptions and using an agreed upon discount rate, as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement. The early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of those future tax benefits. Such payments will be calculated based on certain assumptions, including that we have sufficient taxable income to utilize the full amount of any tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement over the period specified therein. The payments that we will be required to make will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us, but we expect the cash tax savings we will realize from the utilization of the related tax benefits will exceed the amount of any required payments.\nWe are entitled to receive quarterly tax distributions from E2open Holdings, subject to limitations imposed by applicable law and contractual restrictions. The cash received from such tax distributions will first be used by us to satisfy any tax liability and then make any payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect that such tax distributions will be sufficient to fund both our tax liability and the required payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, we expect future gross payments during the fiscal years ending February 2024 of $2.7 million, 2025 of $8.4 million, 2026 of $8.0 million, 2027 of $7.3 million and thereafter of $85.4 million.\nWarrant Liability\nAs of February 28, 2022 and 2021, there were an aggregate of 29,079,872 and 29,079,972 warrants outstanding, respectively, which include the public warrants, private placement warrants and forward purchase warrants. Each warrant entitles its holders to purchase one share of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The warrants are recorded as a liability in warrant liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a balance of $67.1 million and $68.8 million as of February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 and period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021, a gain of $1.6 million and $23.2 million was recognized in gain from change in fair value of the warrant liability in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, 100 warrants were exercised with a total exercise price of $1,150.\nConversion of Contingent Consideration\nThe contingent consideration liability was $45.6 million and $150.8 million as of February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value remeasurements resulted in a loss of $69.8 million and a gain of $33.7 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 and the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021, respectively. There was no gain or loss for the period from March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 and the year ended February 29, 2020 as the underlying equity was not issued until February 4, 2021. The contingent liability represents the Series B-1 common stock, Series B-2 common stock, Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs.\nAs of June 8, 2021, the Series B-1 common stock and Series 1 RCUs were no longer reflected as a contingent consideration liability as the 5-day VWAP of our Class A Common Stock exceeded $13.50 per share. This triggering event resulted in the 8,120,273 Series B-1 common stock converting into Class A Common Stock and 4,379,557 Series 1 RCUs becoming 4,379,557 Common Units of E2open Holdings along with entitling the holders of the newly vested Common Units to 4,379,557 shares of Class V Common Stock.\nLogistyx Acquisition\nOn March 2, 2022, E2open, LLC acquired Logistyx Technologies, LLC for a purchase price of $185 million, with an estimated fair value of $183.7 million, including $90 million paid in cash at closing. An additional $95 million will be paid in two installments on May 31, 2022 and August 29, 2022. We have the option to finance the remaining payments, at our discretion, through cash or a combination of cash and Class A Common Stock. The May 31, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $5.0 million in cash with the total payment equal to $37.4 million. The August 29, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $26.1 million in cash with the total payment equal to $57.6 million.\nInvestments\nOn February 4, 2022, we made a minority investment of $2.5 million in a private firm focused on supply chain financing. We are required to invest an additional $2.5 million 90 days from February 4, 2022.\nLeases\nEffective March 1, 2021, we began accounting for leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets on the balance sheet for contracts that provide lessees with the right to control the use of identified assets for periods of greater than 12 months. Upon adoption of ASC 842, we recognized an operating lease liability of $23.0 million, a ROU operating asset of $22.4 million and no change to retained earnings.\nOur non-cancelable operating leases for our office spaces have various expiration dates through August 2029. Under these leases, our undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the calculation of the lease liabilities as of February 28, 2022 were: $8.5 million for fiscal 2023, $7.3 million for fiscal 2024, $5.6 million for fiscal 2025, $4.0 million for fiscal 2026, $3.0 million for fiscal 2027 and $2.7 million thereafter. These numbers include interest of $2.3 million.\nOur non-cancelable financing lease arrangements relate to software and computer equipment and have various expiration dates through August 2024. We have the right to purchase the software and computer equipment anytime during the lease or upon lease completion. Under these leases, our undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the calculation of the lease liabilities as of February 28, 2022 were: $2.4 million for fiscal 2023 and $2.1 million for fiscal 2024. These numbers include interest of $0.2 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amount of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nSubscription revenue, which primarily consists of fees to provide clients cloud-based access to our solution, is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. Subscription revenue includes logistics as a service which employs logistics professionals to manage a company's transportation network including truck, rail, ocean and air freight as well as inbound/outbound logistics from production facilities to warehouses, retailers and end users/consumers. Typically, amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Transaction-related revenue is recognized as the transactions occur.\nProfessional services revenue is derived primarily from fees for enabling services, including solution consulting and solution deployment. These services are often sold in conjunction with the sale of our solutions. We provide professional services primarily on a time and materials basis, but sometimes on a fixed fee basis. Professional services revenue is recognized as the services are provided. For services that are contracted at a fixed price, progress is generally measured based on labor hours incurred as a percentage of the total estimated hours required for complete satisfaction of the related performance obligations. For services that are contracted on time and materials or prepaid basis, progress is generally based on actual labor hours expended. These input methods (e.g., hours incurred or expended and milestones completed) are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy services contracts as they represent the performance obligation consumed by the client and performed by us, and therefore reflect the transfer of services to a client under such contracts.\nIf our estimate of the total hours required for a performance obligation at a fixed price is inaccurate, then our revenue recognition timing will be impacted as labor hours as a percentage of total estimated hours will be adjusted at the end of the contract resulting in additional or reduced revenue recognized, as needed, to account for the change in hours. We adjust our estimated total hours and the appropriate revenue recognition each month. Any adjustments should not have a material impact to our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations, comprising of subscriptions and professional services. Arrangements with clients typically do not provide the client with the right to take possession of the software supporting the on-demand solutions. We primarily account for subscription and professional services revenue as separate units of accounting and allocate revenue to each deliverable in an arrangement based on standalone selling price. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. We evaluate the standalone selling price for each element by considering prices we charge for similar offerings, size of the order and historical pricing practices. If our judgment is incorrect for a particular item within an arrangement, the timing of our revenue could be impacted between periods such that we would recognize revenue in a different period than we would have if a different judgment had been used; however, the revenue for the full arrangement would have the same result.\nOther revenue primarily includes license fees and travel expenses for services rendered. Other revenue is recognized when the service is delivered to the client.\nDeferred revenue from subscriptions represents amounts collected from, or invoiced to, clients in advance of earning subscription revenue. Typically, we bill our annual subscription fees in advance of providing the service. Deferred revenue from professional services represents revenue for time and material contracts where the revenue is recognized when milestones are achieved and accepted by the client for fixed price contracts.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards at fair value over the requisite service period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of options. The input variable for the Black-Scholes model are the expected life of the option, volatility of our peer group and our common stock, risk free rate of return and expected dividend yield. For restricted stock grants and certain performance-based awards, fair value is determined as the average price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. The determination of fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.\nThe expected terms of the options are based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at grant date. Volatility is based on historical and expected future volatility of our Class A Common Stock. We have not historically issued any dividends and do not expect to in the future.\nFor performance-based awards where the number of shares includes a relative revenue growth modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period, the number of shares earned will depend on which range our total revenue growth falls within over the performance period. The fair value of the performance-based shares with the revenue growth modifier is determined using an intrinsic value model. In the period it becomes probable that the minimum threshold specified in the performance-based award will be achieved, we will recognize expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the award related to the vesting period that has already lapsed. The remaining fair value of the award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the balance of the vesting period. If we determine that it is no longer probable that we will achieve the minimum performance threshold specified in the award, all of the previously recognized compensation expense will be reversed in the period such determination is made.\nWe do not estimate forfeitures; therefore, we record compensation costs for all awards and record forfeitures as they occur.\nIf factors change and we employ different assumptions in the determination of the fair value of grants in future periods, the related compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current or past periods.\nRefer to Note 23, Share-Based and Unit-Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our share-based compensation plans.\nUnit-Based Compensation\nThe pre-Business Combination unit-based compensation expense associated with awards to employees and directors was measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards that were expected to vest. For time based awards, the expense was recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which was generally four years. For performance based awards, the expense was recognized when the performance obligation was probable of occurring. The fair value of options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was impacted by the following assumptions:\n\u2022Expected Term - We estimated the expected term, using the simplified method due to limited exercise data, to be the period of time between the date of grant and the midpoint between option vesting and expiration.\n\u2022Expected Volatility - As E2open Holdings' units were not actively traded, the volatility is based on a benchmark of comparable companies within the SCM software industry.\n\u2022Expected Dividend Yield - The dividend rate used was zero as we did not pay any cash dividends to unit holders.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate - The interest rates used were based on the implied yield available on constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities with a term equal to the expected term of the options.\nThe pre-Business Combination grant date fair value of our common stock was typically determined by our board of members with the assistance of management and a third-party valuation specialist. The grant date fair value of our membership units was determined using valuation methodologies which utilized certain assumptions and weighting of factors, including an income based approach, a market based approach and an assumption for a discount for lack of marketability. Application of these valuation methodologies involved the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, cash flows, discount rates, market multiples and the selection of comparable companies.\nWe did not estimate forfeitures. Instead, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Forfeitures were not material for the periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 and fiscal years ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019.\nWarrant Liability\nWe have public and private placement warrants as well as warrants available under the Forward Purchase Agreement. We classify as equity any equity-linked contracts that (1) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (2) give us a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in our own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). We classify as assets or liabilities any equity-linked contracts that (1) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside our control) or (2) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement).\nFor equity-linked contracts that are classified as liabilities, we record the fair value of the equity-linked contract at each balance sheet date and record the change in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a gain (loss) from change in fair value of warrant liability. Our public warrant liability is valued using the binomial lattice pricing model. Our private placement warrants are valued using a binomial pricing model when the warrants are subject to the make-whole table, or otherwise are valued using a Black-Scholes pricing model. Our Forward Purchase Warrants are valued utilizing observable market prices for public shares and warrants, relative to the present value of contractual cash proceeds. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend rate, expiration dates and risk-free rates.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of our warrant liability changes at each balance sheet date are based on our stock price and other assumptions described above. If our assumptions change or we experience significant volatility in our stock price or interest rates, the fair value calculated from one balance sheet period to the next could be materially different.\nContingent Consideration\nThe contingent consideration liability is due to the issuance of the two tranches of restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs of E2open Holdings as part of the Business Combination. These shares and units were issued on a proportional basis to each holder of Class A shares in CCNB1 and Common Units of E2open Holdings. We also had deferred consideration (earn-out) payments that were due upon the successful attainment of revenue related criteria related to the acquisition of Averetek.\nIn June 2021, the restricted Series B-1 common stock automatically converted into our Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis and the Series 1 RCUs automatically converted into Common Units of E2open Holdings. In July 2021, the deferred consideration due to Averetek was paid in full.\nThese restricted shares, Common Units and deferred consideration payments are treated as a contingent consideration liability under ASC 805 and valued at fair market value on the acquisition date and will be remeasured at each reporting date and adjusted if necessary. Our earn-out liabilities and contingent consideration are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend rates, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. Any change in the fair value of the deferred consideration from the remeasurement will be recorded in acquisition-related expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any change in the fair value of the restricted shares and Common Units from the remeasurement will be recorded in gain (loss) from change in fair value of contingent consideration on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of our contingent consideration changes at each balance sheet date based on our stock price, operating results and other assumptions. If our assumptions change or we experience significant volatility in our stock price or interest rates, the fair value calculated from one balance sheet period to the next could be materially different.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that, in the opinion of management, is more likely than not to be realized.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognizable tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nJudgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe evaluate acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the test is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the test is not met, further determination is required as to whether or not we have acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs which would meet the definition of a business. Significant judgment is required in the application of the test to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets.\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nDetermining estimated fair value requires a significant amount of judgment and estimates. If our assumptions change or errors are determined in our calculations, the fair value could materially change resulting in a change in our goodwill or identifiable net assets acquired.\nRecently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis item contains a discussion of our business, including a general overview of our business, properties, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page 73. This Item 7 contains forward-looking\u201d statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur fiscal year end is the final day in February. Our fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 ended February 28, 2022, February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively, and were each fifty-two-week periods.\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of cloud-based, end-to-end SCM software. Our platform spans many key strategic and operational areas including omni-channel, demand sensing, supply planning, global trade management, transportation and logistics and manufacturing and supply management. Our software combines networks, data and applications to provide a deeply embedded, mission-critical platform that allows clients to optimize their channel and supply chains by accelerating growth, reducing costs, increasing visibility and driving improved resiliency. Given the mission-critical nature of our solutions, we maintain long-term relationships with our clients, which is reflected by our high gross retention and long client tenure. In aggregate, we serve approximately 6,000 clients in all major countries in the world across a wide range of end-markets, including consumer goods, food and beverage, manufacturing, retail, technology and transportation, among others. Our large enterprise clients represent approximately 600 of our clients and are those who, when aggregated to their parent company, report greater than $1 billion in annual revenue and generate $50,000 or more of our annual subscriptions revenue.\nWe operate in what we believe is an attractive industry with strong secular tailwinds and a TAM of more than $54 billion. This TAM is comprised of significant whitespace, which we estimate to be in excess of $1 billion just within our current client base. This upsell opportunity within our existing client base is largely driven by their current technology solution which is often a combination of legacy point solutions and home-grown applications, which are tied together with manual processes and spreadsheets. As manufacturing has evolved from brands owning the full production lifecycle to orchestrating disparate manufacturing, distribution and selling processes conducted across multiple geographies, supply chains have grown more complex, increasing demand for software solutions like ours and the need to modernize the existing technology landscape with cloud-based modern solutions. We believe our fully cloud-based, end-to-end software platform offers a more connected solution for clients that gives them better value as compared to solutions offered by some of our competitors.\nOur Go-To-Market Strategy\nOur go-to-market strategy is focused on both expanding the adoption of our product portfolio with existing clients and the acquisition of new clients. We primarily focus our selling efforts on large enterprise organizations and sell our software primarily through a direct sales force and are expanding our go-to-market presence with partners. Our go-to-market strategy enables our sales force to develop deep, long-term relationships with existing and potential clients across the relevant functions, from buying managers, IT resources, division leaders and C-level executives. Importantly, we believe that our go-to-market approach focused on clients is a competitive advantage compared to competitors whose go-to-market approach is often focused on products, as our clients have one seller who owns the relationship irrespective of the product of interest. We believe this enables us to sustain our high client retention and long client tenure as well as drive maximum spend within each client through an efficient sales model.\nOur sales and marketing organizations are comprised of field sales, inside sales and sales development personnel, and we align these teams based on client size and industry. We focus initially on solving a client's primary need, usually a specific piece of their supply chain. Once a client adopts our solution and witnesses the power of our unique platform, we focus on cross-selling additional products as well as expanding into additional departments, divisions and geographies with the same solution. We have found that experience with our SaaS platform is the most effective selling tool.\nThe Business Combination\nOn February 4, 2021, E2open Holdings and CCNB1 completed the Business Combination contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, CCNB1 acquired a majority interest in E2open Holdings through a series of mergers, with E2open Holdings becoming a direct subsidiary of CCNB1. In connection with the completion of the Business Combination, CCNB1 changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware and changed its name to E2open Parent Holdings, Inc.\u201d\nUpon completion of the Business Combination, CCNB1 was deemed the accounting acquirer and E2open the accounting acquiree. Under the acquisition method of accounting, CCNB1's assets and liabilities retained their carrying values and the assets and liabilities associated with E2open Holdings were recorded at their fair values measured as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The cash consideration in the Business Combination included cash from (1) the Trust Account in the amount of $414.0 million, (2) $525.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of a new term loan, (3) $695.0 million in proceeds from the PIPE Investment and (4) $200.0 million in proceeds from Forward Purchase Agreement. These proceeds were used to pay (x) $601.1 million in cash consideration payable to certain equity owners and option holders of E2open Holdings, including certain non-recurring seller transaction expenses, (y) $978.5 million of existing E2open debt and accrued interest and (z) total non-recurring transaction costs of $105.2 million. The non-recurring transaction costs included acquisition-related advisory fees in connection with the Business Combination, deferred underwriting commissions in connection with CCNB1's IPO and debt issuance costs related to the new credit agreement entered into in connection with the Business Combination but excluded certain seller costs to be paid by the equity owners of E2open Holdings. The deferred underwriting commissions and costs pertaining to the reverse merger were treated as a reduction of equity while merger-related costs were expensed in the period in which the Business Combination closed. The debt issuance costs were capitalized as a reduction to the outstanding debt balances. In addition, certain options to purchase equity interests in E2open Holdings were accelerated upon the Closing Date, which resulted in a non-recurring expense of approximately $28.2 million in the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021. Additionally, unit-based compensation expense of $4.7 million was recognized during the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 related to the restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination for the accelerated unvested options and restricted units.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, our prior year financial results are broken out between the Predecessor period (March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021) and the Successor period (February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021).\nBluJay Acquisition\nOn September 1, 2021, we completed the BluJay Acquisition with the issuance of 72,383,299 shares of Class A Common Stock to the BluJay Sellers and the payment of approximately $771.3 million of cash which includes the repayment of BluJay's debt facility. The total purchase consideration for the BluJay Acquisition was $1.5 billion.\nIn connection with the completion of the BluJay Acquisition, we secured $300 million in PIPE financing from institutional investors for the purchase of an aggregate of 28,909,022 shares of our Class A Common Stock. We also obtained a $380.0 million incremental term loan to our 2021 Term Loan and increased our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility by $80.0 million to $155.0 million. In addition, the letter of credit sublimit was increased from $15.0 million to $30.0 million upon completion of the BluJay Acquisition.\nAdditionally, the Investor Rights Agreement was amended and restated to add certain of BluJay's existing stockholders as parties, including certain affiliates of Francisco Partners and Temasek as well as include a six month lock-up period from September 1, 2021 through February 28, 2022 for certain equity holders of E2open and BluJay. The Investor Rights Agreement also provided Francisco Partners and Temasek the right to nominate one member each to our board of directors. Mr. Deep Shah and Mr. Martin Fichtner became new directors on September 1, 2021.\nLogistyx Acquisition\nOn March 2, 2022, we acquired Logistyx for a purchase price of $185 million, with an estimated fair value of $183.7 million, including $90 million paid in cash at closing. An additional $95 million will be paid in two installments on May 31, 2022 and August 29, 2022. We have the option to fulfill the remaining payments, at our discretion, through cash or a combination of cash and our Class A Common Stock. The May 31, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $5.0 million in cash with the total payment equal to $37.4 million. The August 29, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $26.1 million in cash with the total payment equal to $57.6 million.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused business disruptions worldwide beginning in January 2020. The full extent to which the pandemic will impact our business, operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments that are difficult to accurately predict. We have experienced modest adverse impacts as it relates to lengthening of sales cycles and delays in delivering professional services and training to our clients, primarily in our fiscal 2021 period. However, the delays have resulted in operational savings related in such areas as travel and entertainment, marketing expenses due to virtual versus in-person events and facility costs resulting from the move to a remote workforce. Those savings continued throughout most of our fiscal 2022 year.\nAlthough parts of our business have seemingly returned to pre-pandemic levels, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge in various areas of the world demonstrating that the impact of the pandemic is not yet complete. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we are carefully monitoring the situation to understand its impacts on our business and operations.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe account for all client contracts under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), and all the related amendments. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions and professional services. We recognize revenue when the client contract and associated performance obligations have been identified; the transaction price has been determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract; and the performance obligations have been satisfied.\nSubscription Revenue\nWe offer cloud-based on-demand software solutions, which enable our clients to have constant access to our solutions without the need to manage and support the software and associated hardware themselves. We house the hardware and software in third-party facilities and provide our clients with access to the software solutions, along with data security and storage, backup, recovery services and solution support. Logistics as a service employs logistics professionals to manage a company's transportation network including truck, rail, ocean and air freight as well as inbound/outbound logistics from production facilities to warehouses, retailers and end users/consumers. Our client contracts typically have a term of three to five years, and we recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contracts.\nWe charge primarily fixed annual subscription fees or, in limited cases, transaction fees based on the volume of transactions requested by clients. Typically, the volume-based fees are for small clients and comprise a small percentage of this revenue source.\nFor subscription-based contracts, we generally invoice annually in advance. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. For transactional based contracts, we primarily recognize revenue for these contracts when the performance obligation is fulfilled. Transaction based contracts represented less than 3% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 and the combined Successor and Predecessor periods in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nProfessional Services and Other\nProfessional services revenue is derived primarily from fees for enabling services, including consulting and deployment services for purchased solutions. These services are often sold in conjunction with the sale of our solutions. We provide professional services primarily on a time and materials basis, but sometimes on a fixed fee basis. Clients are invoiced for professional services either monthly in arrears or, as with fixed fee arrangements, in advance and upon reaching project milestones. Professional services revenue is recognized over time. For services that are contracted at a fixed price, progress is generally measured based on labor hours incurred as a percentage of the total estimated hours required for complete satisfaction of the related performance obligations. For services that are contracted on time and materials or a prepaid basis, progress is generally based on actual labor hours expended. These input methods (e.g., hours incurred or expended and milestone completion) are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy services contracts as they represent the performance obligation consumed by the client and performed by us, and therefore reflect the transfer of services to a client under contract.\nWe enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations comprised of subscriptions and professional services. Arrangements with clients typically do not provide the client with the right to take possession of the software supporting the on-demand solutions. We primarily account for subscription and professional services revenue as separate units of accounting and allocate revenue to each deliverable in an arrangement based on a standalone selling price. We evaluate the standalone selling price for each element by considering prices we charge for similar offerings, size of the order and historical pricing practices.\nOther revenue primarily includes license fees and travel expenses for services rendered. Other revenue is recognized when the service is delivered to the client.\nTotal Revenue by Geographic Locations\nRevenues by geographical region consisted of the following:\n\nRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of our contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the client, or where the software solutions are being utilized or accessed. Americas revenue was approximately 86%, 96%, 96% and 96% during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 and fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during these periods.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of Subscription Revenue\nCost of subscription revenue consists primarily of costs related to delivering our service and providing support to clients, including personnel and related costs, costs associated with data center operations and capacity, fees paid to third parties to license their technology and depreciation expense directly related to delivering our solutions. Cost of subscription revenue also includes the costs associated with our logistics as a service revenue which consists of costs related to managing a company's transportation network including truck, rail, ocean and air freight as well as inbound/outbound logistics from production facilities to warehouses, retailers and end users/consumers. We generally expense our cost of subscription revenue as we incur the costs.\nCost of Professional Services and Other Revenue\nCost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel and related travel costs, the costs of contracted third-party vendors and reimbursable expenses. As our personnel are employed on a full-time basis, our cost of professional services is largely fixed in the short-term, while our professional services and other revenue may fluctuate, leading to fluctuations in professional services and other gross profit. We expense our cost of professional services and other revenue as we incur the costs.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs of our research and development staff, costs of certain third-party contractors, depreciation, amortization and other allocated costs. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred, excluding the capitalization of internally developed software costs.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our sales and marketing staff. It also includes the costs of promotional events, corporate communications, online marketing, solution marketing and other brand-building activities, in addition to depreciation, amortization and other allocated costs. When the initial client contract is signed and upon any renewal, we capitalize and amortize commission costs under ASC 606, as an expense over the period in which products are expected to be delivered to clients, where the commission is directly attributable to a contract, including expected renewals, which is estimated to be four years. If a subscription agreement is terminated, we recognize the unamortized portion of any deferred commission cost as an expense immediately upon such termination. Certain sales commissions are contingent on future client billings and are expensed as incurred to sales and marketing expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our executive, administrative, finance, information technology, legal, accounting, investor relations and human resource staff. It also includes professional fees; expenses related to our board of directors; public company costs; other corporate expenses; depreciation; amortization; and other allocated costs.\nContingent Consideration\nThe contingent consideration liability is due to the issuance of the two tranches of restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs of E2open Holdings as part of the Business Combination. These shares and units were issued on a proportional basis to each holder of Class A shares in CCNB1 and Common Units. We also had deferred consideration (earn-out) payments that are due upon the successful attainment of revenue related criteria related to the Averetek, LLC (Averetek) acquisition.\nIn June 2021, the restricted Series B-1 common stock automatically converted into our Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis and the Series 1 RCUs automatically converted into Common Units of E2open Holdings as the Class A Common Stock met the $13.50 five-day VWAP. In July 2021, the deferred consideration due to Averetek was paid in full.\nThese restricted shares, Common Units and deferred consideration payments are treated as a contingent consideration liability under ASC 805 and valued at fair market value on the acquisition date and remeasured at each reporting date and adjusted if necessary. Our earn-out liabilities and contingent consideration are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. Any change in the fair value of the deferred consideration from the remeasurement was recorded in acquisition-related expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any change in the fair value of the restricted shares and Common Units from the remeasurement will be recorded in gain (loss) from change in fair value of contingent consideration on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, consists primarily of interest income on our cash balances; interest expense on our outstanding debt and financing lease obligations; foreign currency realized and unrealized gains and losses; and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of a deferred income tax benefit and current tax expense. The current income taxes primarily result from our profitable operations in foreign subsidiaries, which are subject to corporate income taxes in foreign jurisdictions, plus a relatively immaterial amount of U.S. federal and state income taxes on our lower tier entities not offset by net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred income tax benefit is primarily due to a decrease in overall outside basis difference in the partnership and the book/tax difference realized from intangible amortization. The deferred tax assets of certain other U.S corporate tax consolidated groups and non-U.S. jurisdictions remain offset by a valuation allowance. Realization of these deferred tax assets depends upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Utilization of our net operating losses may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRS Code), and similar state provisions. We have analyzed the effect of the IRS Code Section 382 for each of our acquisitions. Based on analysis of acquired net operating losses and credits, utilization of our net operating losses and research and development credits will be subject to annual limitations. In the event we have future changes in ownership, the availability of net operating loss carryforwards could be further limited.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table is our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated:\n\nFiscal Year ended February 28, 2022 compared to February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 (Successor) and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 (Predecessor)\nThe comparability of our operating results for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 as compared to the periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 was impacted by the Business Combination in February 2021 and the acquisition of BluJay in September 2021. In the discussion of our results of operations, we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services to the extent they remain ascertainable. Revenue and expense contributions from our acquisition for the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the rapid integration of these businesses into our existing operations.\nRevenue\n\n(1)Change represents fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nSubscriptions revenue was $335.6 million in fiscal year 2022, a $61.7 million, or 23%, increase compared to $273.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase in subscriptions revenue was primarily due to the BluJay Acquisition and new organic subscription sales predominantly driven by increases in products utilized across our client portfolio. These increases were partially offset by the $53.6 million amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination. With the early adoption of ASU 2021-08, a fair value adjustment to deferred revenue for the BluJay Acquisition was not required nor recorded; therefore, amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue similar to the Business Combination adjustment will not occur for the BluJay Acquisition or subsequent acquisitions.\nProfessional services and other revenue was $90.0 million in fiscal year 2022, a $33.8 million, or 60%, increase compared to $56.2 million the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. This increase was primarily related to the BluJay Acquisition, clients delaying projects in fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and new subscriptions sales resulting in favorable year-over-year growth.\nSubscriptions revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 79% for our fiscal year ending February 28, 2022 from 83% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. This decrease was primarily related to the amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination and the increase in professional services and other revenue as noted above.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n\n(1)Change represents fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nCost of subscriptions was $93.1 million in fiscal year 2022, a $29.6 million, or 47%, increase compared to $63.4 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase was driven primarily by $27.6 million related to the BluJay Acquisition and an increase in personnel costs for such items as salaries and incentive compensation along with $4.1 million related to depreciation expense on capital expenditures for the expansion of our data centers. These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in share-based compensation due to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination in February 2021.\nCost of professional services and other was $56.1 million in fiscal year 2022, a $11.3 million, or 25%, increase compared to $44.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The BluJay Acquisition in fiscal year 2022 and increased personnel costs such as salaries and incentive compensation accounted for $11.9 million of the increase in cost of professional services and other revenue. The increase was offset by a $0.6 million decrease in share-based compensation due to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination in February 2021.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased to $73.8 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to $23.0 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, primarily driven by the revaluation and change in the composition of the intangible assets as part of the Business Combination in February 2021 and the addition of intangible assets resulting from the BluJay Acquisition in September 2021.\nSubscriptions gross margin decreased to 50% in fiscal year 2022 compared to 68% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, primarily due to the adjustment to deferred revenue as noted above. Professional services and other gross margin increased to 38% in fiscal year 2022 as compared to 20% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 primarily due to our professional services and other revenue returning to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.\nResearch and Development\n\n(1)Change represents fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nResearch and development expenses were $79.7 million in fiscal year 2022, a $15.5 million, or 24%, increase compared to $64.2 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. An increase of $16.4 million was related to the BluJay Acquisition as well as major strategic partnership initiatives around product development efforts during fiscal year 2022. The strategic partnership initiatives resulted in net increased personnel costs such as salaries and incentive compensation as well as consulting expenses. There was also an increase to depreciation expense of $2.7 million related to capital expenditures for software. These increases were partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in share-based compensation due to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination in February 2021.\nSales and Marketing\n\n(1)Change represents fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nSales and marketing expenses were $60.3 million in fiscal year 2022, a $5.4 million, or 10%, increase compared to $54.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. An increase of $10.0 million was primarily driven by the BluJay Acquisition in fiscal 2022 and the investment in our new logo sales and marketing resources. This increase was partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in share-based compensation due to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and a reduction in commission expenses associated with the revaluation of prepaid commissions as a result of the Business Combination in February 2021.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\n(1)Change represents fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $69.9 million in fiscal year 2022, a $9.4 million, or 16%, increase compared to $60.5 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The BluJay Acquisition and costs related to us becoming a public company resulted in a $28.4 million increase over the prior period that was partially offset by a decrease of $18.9 million related to additional share-based compensation recognized related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings and share-based compensation for the restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination for the accelerated unvested options and restricted units during fiscal 2021.\nOther Operating Expenses\n\n(1)Change represents fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nAcquisition and other related expenses were $64.4 million for fiscal year 2022, a $45.7 million increase compared to $18.7 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase was mainly related to legal, consulting and transaction related expenses associated with the BluJay Acquisition in fiscal 2022.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets was $46.4 million for fiscal year 2022, a $13.8 million, or 43%, increase compared to $32.5 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase was a result of the BluJay Acquisition in September 2021 partially offset by the revaluation and change in the composition of the intangible assets associated with the Business Combination in February 2021.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\n\n(1)Change represents fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nInterest and other expense, net was $33.7 million in fiscal year 2022, a $33.7 million, or 50%, decrease compared to $67.4 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the interest rate on the debt refinanced in the Business Combination in February 2021 as well as the reduction in outstanding debt for the first half of fiscal year 2022. Additional debt was borrowed under our existing term loan for the BluJay Acquisition in September 2021; however, the additional borrowings also benefited from the lower interest rates.\nChange in Tax Receivable Agreement\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we recorded a $0.2 million expense related to the change in the fair value of the tax receivable agreement liability under ASC 805, including interest. We have calculated the fair value of the tax receivable agreement payments and identified the timing of the utilization of the tax attributes. The tax receivable agreement liability, related to exchanges as of the Business Combination date, is revalued at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss as well as the associated interest reflected in change in tax receivable agreement liability in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the event occurred. We did not have a tax receivable agreement prior to the Business Combination.\nIn addition, under ASC 450, transactions with partnership unit holders after the acquisition date will result in additional Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities that are recorded on a gross undiscounted basis. The increase in the Tax Receivable Agreement liability under ASC 450 for fiscal year 2022 was $16.3 million.\nGain from Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability\n\n(1)Change represents fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nWe recorded a gain of $1.6 million during fiscal year 2022 compared to $23.2 million during the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 for the change in fair value on the revaluation of our warrant liability associated with our public, private placement and forward purchase warrants. This change in fair value was related to such items as the change in our stock price, the volatility of the stock price of our peer group, changes in the risk free interest rate and expected exercise date of the warrants. We are required to revalue the warrants at the end of each reporting period and reflect in the Consolidated Statements of Operations a gain or loss from the change in fair value of the warrant liability in the period in which the change occurred.\nGain from Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\n\n(1)Change represents fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nWe recorded a loss of $69.8 million for fiscal year 2022 and a gain of $33.7 million during the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 for the change in fair value on the revaluation of our contingent consideration associated with our restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and Sponsor Side Letter. This change in fair value was related to such items as the change in the volatility of the stock price of our peer group, changes in the risk free interest rate and our expected stock price. We are required to revalue the contingent consideration at the end of each reporting period and reflect in the Consolidated Statements of Operations a gain or loss from the change in fair value of the contingent consideration in the period in which the change occurred.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n(1)Change represents fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nLoss before income taxes was $220.0 million in fiscal year 2022, a $177.6 million increase compared to a net loss of $42.4 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase is primarily related to the $45.7 million acquisition related expenses for the BluJay Acquisition, a $13.8 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets, a $21.6 million change in the gain on the fair value adjustment for the warrant liability, an increased loss of $103.5 million associated with the fair value adjustment for the contingent consideration liability related to the Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and a $45.8 million increase in amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination compared to fiscal year 2021. These expenses were partially offset by $33.7 million of lower interest expense in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021.\nThe income tax benefit was $30.1 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $7.3 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The change was primarily due to an increase in loss from continuing operations included in the tax provision for fiscal 2022 that resulted in a decrease in the overall basis difference in the partnership. This benefit was partially offset by nondeductible mark-to-market losses associated with contingent liabilities and certain equity consideration liabilities and changes in valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions within which we operate as well as the impact to fiscal 2022 of losses attributable to our noncontrolling interest in our affiliate. In accordance with ASC 740-20-45-11, we accounted for the tax effect of the step-up in income tax basis related to transactions with or among shareholders and recognized a deferred tax asset and corresponding increase in stockholders' equity of $36.8 million.\nFebruary 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 (Successor) and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 (Predecessor) compared to Fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 (Predecessor)\nThe comparability of our operating results for the periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 as compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 was impacted by the Business Combination in February 2021 and the acquisition of Amber Road in July 2019. In the discussion of our results of operations, we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services to the extent they remain ascertainable. Expense contributions from our acquisition for the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations.\nRevenue\n\n(1)Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.\nSubscription revenue was $273.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $29.8 million, or 12%, increase compared to subscription revenue of $244.0 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The increase in subscription revenue was primarily related to the acquisition of Amber Road. The balance of the increase was primarily related to new organic subscription sales in the prior periods, predominantly driven by increases in products utilized across our client portfolio.\nProfessional services and other revenue was $56.2 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $4.9 million, or 8%, decrease compared to $61.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which delayed the delivery of professional services and training to our clients, mainly due to our clients' focus on switching to remote operations during the first half of fiscal 2021, which began on March 1, 2021. Importantly, although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed planned client engagements, we did not experience any material cancellations of engagements. Professional services and other revenue was also impacted by fewer new subscription sales closed in early fiscal 2021 as compared to the fiscal 2020. We attribute this temporary delay in closing new subscription sales to the COVID-19 pandemic as our clients were focused on the impact of the pandemic on their operations rather than launching new technology projects.\nOur subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 83% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to 80% for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 driven primarily by the increase in subscription revenue and decline in professional services and other revenue described above.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n\n(1)Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.\nCost of subscriptions was $63.4 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $4.3 million, or 7%, increase compared to $59.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. This increase is primarily related to the acquisition of Amber Road and $2.5 million of unit-based compensation recognized related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination, partially offset by the realization of acquisition-related cost savings from acquisitions.\nCost of professional services and other revenue was $44.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $2.4 million, or 6%, increase compared to $42.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. This increase is primarily related to the acquisition of Amber Road and $0.7 million unit-based compensation recognized related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination. We proactively decided to invest in our professional services organization during the COVID-19 pandemic as a means of providing additional service to and deeper relationships with our clients.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets was $23.0 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $3.4 million, or 18%, increase compared to $19.5 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, driven primarily by additional intangibles from the acquisition of Amber Road and the reevaluation of the intangible assets as part of the Business Combination in February 2021.\nOur subscriptions gross margin remained consistent at 68% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal years ended February 28, 2021 and fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. Our professional services and other gross margin declined to 20% for fiscal 2021 from 31% in the fiscal 2020, primarily due to lower professional services and other revenue in the current period as described above.\nResearch and Development\n\n(1)Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.\nResearch and development expenses were $64.2 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $2.4 million, or 4%, increase compared to $61.9 million in the prior year. The increase is due to $5.2 million of additional unit-based compensation expense recognized related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination, partially offset by leveraging the existing E2open operating model and managerial structure resulting in cost savings associated with the acquisition of Amber Road.\nSales and Marketing\n\n(1)Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.\nSales and marketing expenses were $54.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $1.2 million, or 2%, increase compared to $53.6 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to $5.1 million of additional unit-based compensation recognized related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and associated costs of the Amber Road acquisition, partially offset by the realization of acquisition-related cost savings from historical acquisitions.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\n(1)Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $60.5 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $8.7 million, or 17%, increase compared to $51.8 million in the prior year. The increase is driven primarily by $14.7 million of additional unit-based compensation recognized related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and $4.7 million unit-based compensation for the restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination for the accelerated unvested options and restricted units during fiscal 2021. These increases were partially offset by the $9.5 million of unit-based compensation attributable to the acceleration of certain unit-based awards in connection with the Amber Road acquisition during fiscal 2020, as well as the realization of acquisition-related cost savings from historical acquisitions.\nOther Operating Expenses\n\n(1)Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.\nOther operating expenses were $51.2 million for combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal 2021, a $6.7 million, or 11%, decrease compared to $57.8 million in the prior year. The decrease is mainly due to the significant transaction related expenses incurred in fiscal 2020 for Amber Road.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\n\n(1)Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.\nInterest expense increased to $67.4 million for combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal 2021, a $0.2 million decrease compared to $67.6 million in the prior year. This decrease is driven primarily by the incremental debt incurred to finance the acquisition of Amber Road, partially offset by the reduction in outstanding debt as well as the associated interest rate on the debt refinanced in the Business Combination and other income earned during fiscal 2021.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, we repaid the full outstanding principal balance of $907.3 million of the Term Loan Due 2024, as defined below, using proceeds from the Business Combination. Additionally, we entered into a new $525.0 million term loan and a $75.0 million revolver in connection with the Business Combination. See Debt below for additional details.\nGain from Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability\nWe recorded a gain of $23.2 million during the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 for the change in fair value on the revaluation of our warrant liability associated with our public, private placement and forward purchase warrants. We are required to revalue the warrants at the end of each reporting period and reflect in the Consolidated Statements of Operations a gain or loss from the change in fair value of the warrant liability in the period in which the change occurred. We did not have outstanding warrants prior to the Business Combination.\nGain from Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nWe recorded a gain of $33.7 million during the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 for the change in fair value on the revaluation of our contingent consideration associated with our restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and Sponsor Side Letter. We are required to revalue the contingent consideration at the end of each reporting period and reflect in the Consolidated Statements of Operations a gain or loss from the change in fair value of the contingent consideration in the period in which the change occurred.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n(1)Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.\nLoss before income taxes is $42.4 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $66.3 million, or 61%, decrease compared to $108.6 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. This decrease is related primarily to the acquisition of Amber Road, stronger operating results, the $9.5 million unit-based compensation recognized in fiscal 2020 attributable to the acceleration of certain unit-based awards related to the Amber Road acquisition, additional integration-related cost savings realized from historical acquisitions, $23.2 million income for the fair value adjustment as of February 28, 2021 for the warrant liability and $33.7 million income associated with the fair value adjustment as of February 28, 2021 for the contingent consideration liability related to the Sponsor Side Letter and restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock. The benefits were partially offset by higher interest expense in fiscal 2020 due to incremental debt incurred to finance the Amber Road acquisition, $28.2 million of unit-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and $4.7 million of unit-based compensation expense for the restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination for the accelerated unvested options and restricted units.\nNotwithstanding that the $7.3 million income tax benefit is substantially the same for each period, the effective tax rate is 17.2% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, compared to 6.2%, for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The overall increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the relative change in state taxes, earnings at affiliate, changes in valuation allowances and changes due to the fair value of equity compensation related to the Business Combination.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis document includes Non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP subscriptions revenue, Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP performance measures that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry.\nWe calculate and define Non-GAAP revenue as revenue and subscriptions revenue excluding the impact of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination. We calculate and define Non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items. We define and calculate EBITDA as net income or losses excluding interest income or expense, income tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the following items: amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, transaction-related costs, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, (gain) loss from changes in the fair value of the warrant liability and contingent consideration, share-based compensation and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items as described in the reconciliation below. We also report Non-GAAP gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Non-GAAP revenue as additional measures to evaluate financial performance.\nWe include these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain expenses that are required in accordance with U.S. GAAP because they are non-recurring (for example, in the case of transaction-related costs and amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment), non-cash (for example, in the case of depreciation, amortization, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, (gain) loss from changes in the fair value of the warrant liability and contingent consideration, share-based compensation and amortization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment) or are not related to our underlying business performance (for example, in the case of interest income and expense). There are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in the U.S. GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from U.S. GAAP financial measures such as net income or loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe table below presents our Non-GAAP revenue reconciled to our reported revenue, the closest U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:\n\n(1)Includes the amortization of the fair value adjustment to the deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination.\nThe table below presents our Non-GAAP gross profit reconciled to our reported gross profit, the closest U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:\n\n(1)Includes the fair value adjustment to the deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination.\n(2)Primarily includes other non-recurring expenses such as systems integrations, legal entity simplification, advisory fees and expenses related to retention of key employees from acquisitions.\n(3)Reflects primarily non-cash, long-term share-based and unit-based compensation expense, primarily related to senior management.

The increase in Non-GAAP revenue was mainly due to the increase in our subscriptions revenue related to the BluJay Acquisition and new organic subscription sales driven by increases in products utilized across our current client portfolio. Additionally, $33.8 million of the increase was due to an increase in our professional services and other revenue primarily related to the BluJay Acquisition, clients delaying projects in fiscal year 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in favorable year-over-year growth and new subscription sales.\nGross Profit\n\n(1)Change represents the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nGross profit was $202.6 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, a $3.7 million, or 2%, increase compared to $198.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the subscriptions and professional services and other revenue growth discussed above offset by the $53.6 million amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination. Gross margin was 48% for fiscal 2022 compared to 60% for fiscal 2021.\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit\n\n(1)Change represents the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nNon-GAAP gross profit was $344.2 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, a $103.4 million, or 43%, increase compared to $240.8 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.

EBITDA margins decreased to a negative 11% for fiscal 2022 compared to 29% for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The decrease in EBITDA and EBITDA margins was primarily related to the $53.6 million amortization of the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue related to the purchase price allocation in the Business Combination, a loss of $69.8 million associated with the fair value adjustment for the contingent consideration liability related to the Sponsor Side Letter and restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and the additional $45.7 million of acquisition related expenses incurred in fiscal 2022 related to the BluJay Acquisition. These higher expenses were partially offset by a gain of $1.6 million for the fair value adjustment for the warrant liability and $29.8 million of lower share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2022 due to the acceleration of unvested options and restricted units of E2open Holdings in connection with the Business Combination in February 2021 and higher revenues in fiscal 2022.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n(1)Change represents the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $162.5 million for fiscal year 2022, a $53.0 million, or 48%, increase compared to $109.5 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 34% for fiscal 2022 compared to 32% for fiscal 2021.

The increase in EBITDA and EBITDA margin was primarily related to stronger operating results due to organic revenue growth, the acquisition of Amber Road in fiscal 2021 and the realization of integration-related cost savings from historical acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n(1)Change represents the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $109.5 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, a $40.9 million, or 60%, increase compared to $68.5 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 32% for fiscal 2021 compared to 22% for fiscal 2020. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins were primarily related to the acquisition of Amber Road, stronger operating results and the realization of integration-related cost savings from historical acquisitions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital, capital expenditure needs, contractual obligations and other commitments, with cash flows from operations and other sources of funding. Current working capital needs relate mainly to employee compensation and benefits, as well as interest and debt. Our ability to expand and grow our business will depend on many factors, including working capital needs and the evolution of our operating cash flows.\nWe had $155.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $75.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2022. See Note 13, Notes Payable to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, the borrowing capacity under our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt repayment and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. On April 6, 2022, the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to include a $190.0 million incremental term loan. A portion of the proceeds were used to repay the $80.0 million outstanding balance under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing.\nDebt\n2021 Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility\nOn February 4, 2021, as part of the Business Combination, E2open, LLC, our subsidiary, entered into a $525.0 million term loan (2021 Term Loan) and a $75.0 million revolver (2021 Revolving Credit Facility). On September 1, 2021, as part of the BluJay Acquisition, the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to include a $380.0 million incremental term loan, an increase in the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility from $75.0 million to $155.0 million and an increase in the letter of credit sublimit from $15.0 million to $30.0 million.\nE2open, LLC can request increases in the revolving commitments and additional term loan facilities, in minimum amounts of $2.0 million for each facility. The Credit Agreement was payable in quarterly installments of $1.3 million beginning in August 2021; however, the payments were increased to $2.3 million with the addition of the incremental term loan beginning in November 2021. The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility will mature on February 4, 2026 and the Credit Agreement is payable in full on February 4, 2028.\nThe 2021 Term Loan has a variable interest rate which was LIBOR plus 350 basis points, with a 50 basis point floor, or 4.00% as of February 28, 2022 and 3.69% as of February 28, 2021. Principal payments of $2.3 million are due on the last day of each February, May, August and November. As of February 28, 2022 and 2021, the 2021 Term Loan had a principal balance outstanding of $899.2 million and $525.0 million, respectively. There were $80.0 million of borrowings outstanding at an interest rate of 5.25%, no outstanding letters of credit and $75.0 million available borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2022. The $80.0 million borrowings were used to fund the initial purchase price of the Logistyx acquisition. There were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2021.\nThe principal payment obligations under our notes payable as of February 28, 2022 were: $89.1 million for fiscal 2023, $9.1 million for fiscal 2024, $9.1 million for fiscal 2025, $9.1 million for fiscal 2026, $9.1 million for fiscal 2027 and $853.9 million thereafter.\nOn April 6, 2022, the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to include a $190.0 million incremental term loan. The proceeds were used to repay the $80.0 million outstanding balance under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility incurred to finance the initial purchase price payment for Logistyx. The additional cash provided us the cash needed to pay the remaining $95.0 million purchase price commitments for Logistyx, should we elect to pay cash in lieu of stock, and may be used for share repurchases or other general corporate purposes.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents net cash from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities:\n\nFiscal year ended February 28, 2022 compared to February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 (Successor) and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 (Predecessor)\nFor the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by approximately $32.9 million to $174.6 million as compared to our balance of $207.5 million as of February 28, 2021.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2022 was $51.2 million compared to $14.5 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in gross profit due to the BluJay Acquisition, new organic subscription sales, an increase in professional services due to clients delaying projects in fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, interest savings on our debt and an increase in cash provided by working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $808.5 million for fiscal year 2022 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $481.3 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities was attributed primarily to the acquisition of BluJay in September 2021. Capital expenditures mainly for the acquisition of property and software related to our data centers was $31.8 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to $15.5 million in the prior year. Additionally, we made a minority investment of $2.5 million in a private firm focused on supply chain financing.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2022 was $710.7 million compared to $626.0 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to additional debt of $117.0 million, net of offering costs, borrowed to finance the BluJay Acquisition. This increase in cash was offset by the repurchase of $2.5 million of common stock, the repurchase of $16.8 million of Common Units and the payment of $10.4 million of debt issuance costs in fiscal 2022. Additionally, we received $3.5 million in cash from the sale of membership units in fiscal 2021.\nFebruary 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 (Successor) and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 (Predecessor) compared to Fiscal year ended February 29, 2020\nAs of February 28, 2021, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $207.5 million, a $159.1 million increase from our balance of $48.4 million as of February 29, 2020, which as primarily due to the Business Combination.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 was $14.5 million compared to a use of cash of $55.8 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The $70.3 million difference was largely driven by the increase in EBITDA for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $481.3 million and $443.0 million for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 and fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, respectively. The use of cash for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods in 2021 was primarily driven by the Business Combination and acquisition of property and software related to our data centers while the use of cash for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 was primarily driven by the acquisition of Amber Road.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 was $626.0 million compared to $467.6 million for fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was a result of $158.3 million of cash received from the PIPE Investors above the additional borrowings in 2020 compared to 2021. Additionally, in 2020, we incurred debt issuance costs of $12.9 million. Debt issuance costs were incurred during the period from February 4 through February 28, 2021 as part of the Business Combination.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nConcurrently with the completion of the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with certain selling equity holders of E2open Holdings. The Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by the Company of 85% of certain tax benefits that are realized or deemed realized as a result of increases in tax, utilization of pre-existing tax attributes of certain sellers and realization of additional tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement for an amount representing the present value of anticipated future tax benefits under the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of the cash tax savings.\nAmounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be contingent upon, among other things, our generation of taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we would not be required to make the related payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Although the amount of any payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be significant, the timing of these payments will vary and will generally be limited to one payment per member per year.\nThe liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement was $66.6 million and $50.1 million as of February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively, assuming (1) a constant corporate tax rate of 24.1%, (2) no dispositions of corporate subsidiaries, (3) no material changes in tax law and (4) we do not elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, due to the uncertainty of various factors, including: (a) the timing and value of future exchanges, (b) the amount and timing of our future taxable income, (c) changes in our tax rate, (d) no future dispositions of any corporate stock, (e) changes in the tax law and (f) changes in the discount rate, the likely tax savings we will realize and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay to the E2open Sellers pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement are uncertain. Additionally, interest will accrue on the portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability recorded under ASC 805 at a rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability under ASC 450 is recorded on a gross undiscounted basis.\nThe liability recorded on the balance sheet does not include an estimate of the amount of payments to be made if certain sellers exchanged their remaining interests in E2open Holdings for our common stock, as this amount is not readily determinable and is dependent on several future variables, including timing of future exchanges, stock price at date of exchange, tax attributes of the individual parties to the exchange and changes in future applicable federal and state tax rates.\nIn addition, if we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur, we will be required to make immediate cash payments. Such cash payments will be equal to the present value of the assumed future realized tax benefits based on a set of assumptions and using an agreed upon discount rate, as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement. The early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of those future tax benefits. Such payments will be calculated based on certain assumptions, including that we have sufficient taxable income to utilize the full amount of any tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement over the period specified therein. The payments that we will be required to make will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us, but we expect the cash tax savings we will realize from the utilization of the related tax benefits will exceed the amount of any required payments.\nWe are entitled to receive quarterly tax distributions from E2open Holdings, subject to limitations imposed by applicable law and contractual restrictions. The cash received from such tax distributions will first be used by us to satisfy any tax liability and then make any payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect that such tax distributions will be sufficient to fund both our tax liability and the required payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, we expect future gross payments during the fiscal years ending February 2024 of $2.7 million, 2025 of $8.4 million, 2026 of $8.0 million, 2027 of $7.3 million and thereafter of $85.4 million.\nWarrant Liability\nAs of February 28, 2022 and 2021, there were an aggregate of 29,079,872 and 29,079,972 warrants outstanding, respectively, which include the public warrants, private placement warrants and forward purchase warrants. Each warrant entitles its holders to purchase one share of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The warrants are recorded as a liability in warrant liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a balance of $67.1 million and $68.8 million as of February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 and period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021, a gain of $1.6 million and $23.2 million was recognized in gain from change in fair value of the warrant liability in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, 100 warrants were exercised with a total exercise price of $1,150.\nConversion of Contingent Consideration\nThe contingent consideration liability was $45.6 million and $150.8 million as of February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value remeasurements resulted in a loss of $69.8 million and a gain of $33.7 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 and the period from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021, respectively. There was no gain or loss for the period from March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 and the year ended February 29, 2020 as the underlying equity was not issued until February 4, 2021. The contingent liability represents the Series B-1 common stock, Series B-2 common stock, Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs.\nAs of June 8, 2021, the Series B-1 common stock and Series 1 RCUs were no longer reflected as a contingent consideration liability as the 5-day VWAP of our Class A Common Stock exceeded $13.50 per share. This triggering event resulted in the 8,120,273 Series B-1 common stock converting into Class A Common Stock and 4,379,557 Series 1 RCUs becoming 4,379,557 Common Units of E2open Holdings along with entitling the holders of the newly vested Common Units to 4,379,557 shares of Class V Common Stock.\nLogistyx Acquisition\nOn March 2, 2022, E2open, LLC acquired Logistyx Technologies, LLC for a purchase price of $185 million, with an estimated fair value of $183.7 million, including $90 million paid in cash at closing. An additional $95 million will be paid in two installments on May 31, 2022 and August 29, 2022. We have the option to finance the remaining payments, at our discretion, through cash or a combination of cash and Class A Common Stock. The May 31, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $5.0 million in cash with the total payment equal to $37.4 million. The August 29, 2022 payment shall consist of at least $26.1 million in cash with the total payment equal to $57.6 million.\nInvestments\nOn February 4, 2022, we made a minority investment of $2.5 million in a private firm focused on supply chain financing. We are required to invest an additional $2.5 million 90 days from February 4, 2022.\nLeases\nEffective March 1, 2021, we began accounting for leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets on the balance sheet for contracts that provide lessees with the right to control the use of identified assets for periods of greater than 12 months. Upon adoption of ASC 842, we recognized an operating lease liability of $23.0 million, a ROU operating asset of $22.4 million and no change to retained earnings.\nOur non-cancelable operating leases for our office spaces have various expiration dates through August 2029. Under these leases, our undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the calculation of the lease liabilities as of February 28, 2022 were: $8.5 million for fiscal 2023, $7.3 million for fiscal 2024, $5.6 million for fiscal 2025, $4.0 million for fiscal 2026, $3.0 million for fiscal 2027 and $2.7 million thereafter. These numbers include interest of $2.3 million.\nOur non-cancelable financing lease arrangements relate to software and computer equipment and have various expiration dates through August 2024. We have the right to purchase the software and computer equipment anytime during the lease or upon lease completion. Under these leases, our undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the calculation of the lease liabilities as of February 28, 2022 were: $2.4 million for fiscal 2023 and $2.1 million for fiscal 2024. These numbers include interest of $0.2 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amount of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nSubscription revenue, which primarily consists of fees to provide clients cloud-based access to our solution, is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. Subscription revenue includes logistics as a service which employs logistics professionals to manage a company's transportation network including truck, rail, ocean and air freight as well as inbound/outbound logistics from production facilities to warehouses, retailers and end users/consumers. Typically, amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Transaction-related revenue is recognized as the transactions occur.\nProfessional services revenue is derived primarily from fees for enabling services, including solution consulting and solution deployment. These services are often sold in conjunction with the sale of our solutions. We provide professional services primarily on a time and materials basis, but sometimes on a fixed fee basis. Professional services revenue is recognized as the services are provided. For services that are contracted at a fixed price, progress is generally measured based on labor hours incurred as a percentage of the total estimated hours required for complete satisfaction of the related performance obligations. For services that are contracted on time and materials or prepaid basis, progress is generally based on actual labor hours expended. These input methods (e.g., hours incurred or expended and milestones completed) are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy services contracts as they represent the performance obligation consumed by the client and performed by us, and therefore reflect the transfer of services to a client under such contracts.\nIf our estimate of the total hours required for a performance obligation at a fixed price is inaccurate, then our revenue recognition timing will be impacted as labor hours as a percentage of total estimated hours will be adjusted at the end of the contract resulting in additional or reduced revenue recognized, as needed, to account for the change in hours. We adjust our estimated total hours and the appropriate revenue recognition each month. Any adjustments should not have a material impact to our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations, comprising of subscriptions and professional services. Arrangements with clients typically do not provide the client with the right to take possession of the software supporting the on-demand solutions. We primarily account for subscription and professional services revenue as separate units of accounting and allocate revenue to each deliverable in an arrangement based on standalone selling price. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. We evaluate the standalone selling price for each element by considering prices we charge for similar offerings, size of the order and historical pricing practices. If our judgment is incorrect for a particular item within an arrangement, the timing of our revenue could be impacted between periods such that we would recognize revenue in a different period than we would have if a different judgment had been used; however, the revenue for the full arrangement would have the same result.\nOther revenue primarily includes license fees and travel expenses for services rendered. Other revenue is recognized when the service is delivered to the client.\nDeferred revenue from subscriptions represents amounts collected from, or invoiced to, clients in advance of earning subscription revenue. Typically, we bill our annual subscription fees in advance of providing the service. Deferred revenue from professional services represents revenue for time and material contracts where the revenue is recognized when milestones are achieved and accepted by the client for fixed price contracts.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards at fair value over the requisite service period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of options. The input variable for the Black-Scholes model are the expected life of the option, volatility of our peer group and our common stock, risk free rate of return and expected dividend yield. For restricted stock grants and certain performance-based awards, fair value is determined as the average price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. The determination of fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.\nThe expected terms of the options are based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at grant date. Volatility is based on historical and expected future volatility of our Class A Common Stock. We have not historically issued any dividends and do not expect to in the future.\nFor performance-based awards where the number of shares includes a relative revenue growth modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period, the number of shares earned will depend on which range our total revenue growth falls within over the performance period. The fair value of the performance-based shares with the revenue growth modifier is determined using an intrinsic value model. In the period it becomes probable that the minimum threshold specified in the performance-based award will be achieved, we will recognize expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the award related to the vesting period that has already lapsed. The remaining fair value of the award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the balance of the vesting period. If we determine that it is no longer probable that we will achieve the minimum performance threshold specified in the award, all of the previously recognized compensation expense will be reversed in the period such determination is made.\nWe do not estimate forfeitures; therefore, we record compensation costs for all awards and record forfeitures as they occur.\nIf factors change and we employ different assumptions in the determination of the fair value of grants in future periods, the related compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current or past periods.\nRefer to Note 23, Share-Based and Unit-Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our share-based compensation plans.\nUnit-Based Compensation\nThe pre-Business Combination unit-based compensation expense associated with awards to employees and directors was measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards that were expected to vest. For time based awards, the expense was recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which was generally four years. For performance based awards, the expense was recognized when the performance obligation was probable of occurring. The fair value of options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was impacted by the following assumptions:\n\u2022Expected Term - We estimated the expected term, using the simplified method due to limited exercise data, to be the period of time between the date of grant and the midpoint between option vesting and expiration.\n\u2022Expected Volatility - As E2open Holdings' units were not actively traded, the volatility is based on a benchmark of comparable companies within the SCM software industry.\n\u2022Expected Dividend Yield - The dividend rate used was zero as we did not pay any cash dividends to unit holders.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate - The interest rates used were based on the implied yield available on constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities with a term equal to the expected term of the options.\nThe pre-Business Combination grant date fair value of our common stock was typically determined by our board of members with the assistance of management and a third-party valuation specialist. The grant date fair value of our membership units was determined using valuation methodologies which utilized certain assumptions and weighting of factors, including an income based approach, a market based approach and an assumption for a discount for lack of marketability. Application of these valuation methodologies involved the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, cash flows, discount rates, market multiples and the selection of comparable companies.\nWe did not estimate forfeitures. Instead, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Forfeitures were not material for the periods from February 4, 2021 through February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020 through February 3, 2021 and fiscal years ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019.\nWarrant Liability\nWe have public and private placement warrants as well as warrants available under the Forward Purchase Agreement. We classify as equity any equity-linked contracts that (1) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (2) give us a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in our own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). We classify as assets or liabilities any equity-linked contracts that (1) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside our control) or (2) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement).\nFor equity-linked contracts that are classified as liabilities, we record the fair value of the equity-linked contract at each balance sheet date and record the change in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a gain (loss) from change in fair value of warrant liability. Our public warrant liability is valued using the binomial lattice pricing model. Our private placement warrants are valued using a binomial pricing model when the warrants are subject to the make-whole table, or otherwise are valued using a Black-Scholes pricing model. Our Forward Purchase Warrants are valued utilizing observable market prices for public shares and warrants, relative to the present value of contractual cash proceeds. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend rate, expiration dates and risk-free rates.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of our warrant liability changes at each balance sheet date are based on our stock price and other assumptions described above. If our assumptions change or we experience significant volatility in our stock price or interest rates, the fair value calculated from one balance sheet period to the next could be materially different.\nContingent Consideration\nThe contingent consideration liability is due to the issuance of the two tranches of restricted Series B-1 and B-2 common stock and Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs of E2open Holdings as part of the Business Combination. These shares and units were issued on a proportional basis to each holder of Class A shares in CCNB1 and Common Units of E2open Holdings. We also had deferred consideration (earn-out) payments that were due upon the successful attainment of revenue related criteria related to the acquisition of Averetek.\nIn June 2021, the restricted Series B-1 common stock automatically converted into our Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis and the Series 1 RCUs automatically converted into Common Units of E2open Holdings. In July 2021, the deferred consideration due to Averetek was paid in full.\nThese restricted shares, Common Units and deferred consideration payments are treated as a contingent consideration liability under ASC 805 and valued at fair market value on the acquisition date and will be remeasured at each reporting date and adjusted if necessary. Our earn-out liabilities and contingent consideration are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend rates, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. Any change in the fair value of the deferred consideration from the remeasurement will be recorded in acquisition-related expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any change in the fair value of the restricted shares and Common Units from the remeasurement will be recorded in gain (loss) from change in fair value of contingent consideration on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of our contingent consideration changes at each balance sheet date based on our stock price, operating results and other assumptions. If our assumptions change or we experience significant volatility in our stock price or interest rates, the fair value calculated from one balance sheet period to the next could be materially different.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that, in the opinion of management, is more likely than not to be realized.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognizable tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nJudgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe evaluate acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the test is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the test is not met, further determination is required as to whether or not we have acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs which would meet the definition of a business. Significant judgment is required in the application of the test to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets.\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nDetermining estimated fair value requires a significant amount of judgment and estimates. If our assumptions change or errors are determined in our calculations, the fair value could materially change resulting in a change in our goodwill or identifiable net assets acquired.\nRecently

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The report contains detailed discussions regarding the company's financial state, including insights into their business operations, properties, liquidity, capital resources, and market risks. The company is a leading provider of cloud-based Supply Chain Management (SCM) software and has maintained long-term relationships with clients reflective of their high retention rates. They serve approximately 6,000 clients globally, including 600 large enterprise clients.\n\nThe company operates in a strong industry with favorable conditions and an estimated Total Addressable Market (TAM) of over $54 billion. Their go-to-market strategy focuses on expanding product adoption with existing clients and new client acquisition through direct sales and partnerships.\n\nA significant event mentioned is the Business Combination where E2open Holdings and CCNB1 completed a merger resulting in E2open Holdings becoming a direct subsidiary of CCNB1, which subsequently changed its jurisdiction of incorporation and its name to E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. This caused a change in the accounting acquirer and adjustments in the assets, liabilities, and goodwill.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business and operations is acknowledged, with certain challenges such as extended sales cycles and delays in professional service deliveries. However, these events have also led to operational savings in other areas.\n\nRevenue has increased, with subscriptions comprising a significant portion of total revenue. The increase is attributed to the BluJay Acquisition and growth in subscription sales across their diverse client base. Costs of revenue, operating expenses, interest, other expenses, and provisions for income taxes are also discussed in detail.\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as performance measures, which exclude certain significant expenses as they are either non-recurring or non-cash, providing a clearer view of operational performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are also presented to further supplement this data.\n\nThe company has sustained investments and has resources to meet commitments for at least the next twelve months. They have a Tax Receivable Agreement aligning with certain equity holders, a warrant liability due to outstanding warrants, and contingent consideration liabilities related to equity issued in the Business Combination.\n\nThe liquidity section indicates that the company has sufficient cash, cash equivalents, and undrawn credit facilities. As of February 28, 2022, they have seen a decrease in cash and cash equivalents but maintain a strong financial position with significant cash inflow from operating activities.\n\nKey accounting policies related to revenue recognition, share-based compensation, unit-based compensation, warrant liability, contingent consideration, provision for income taxes, and business combinations are detailed, explaining the judgments and estimates crucial in financial reporting.\n\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements, including updates on the accounting for leases and transactions that may be classified as business combinations or asset acquisitions, have an impact on the financial statements and are also discussed.\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding, this discussion should be read alongside the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The report includes forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties."}
