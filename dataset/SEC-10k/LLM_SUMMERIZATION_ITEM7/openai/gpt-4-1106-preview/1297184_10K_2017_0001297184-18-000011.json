Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in Item 8 under the heading Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors, include among others, those identified under the Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d above and described in greater detail elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses primarily on developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling technically challenging generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products as well as insulin API products. We currently manufacture and sell over 20 products. We are currently developing a portfolio of 15 generic abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, three generic biosimilar product candidates and six proprietary product candidates, which are in various stages of development and target a variety of indications. With respect to these product candidates, we have three ANDAs, and two NDAs on file with the FDA.\nOur largest products by net revenues currently include naloxone hydrochloride injection, lidocaine jelly and sterile solution, phytonadione injection, and enoxaparin sodium injection.\nTo complement our internal growth and expertise, we have made several strategic acquisitions of companies, products and technologies. These acquisitions collectively have strengthened our core injectable and inhalation product technology infrastructure by providing additional manufacturing, marketing, and research and development capabilities including the ability to manufacture raw materials, APIs and other components for our products.\nIncluded in these acquisitions are marketing authorizations for 33 products in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, representing 11 different injectable chemical entities, from UCB Pharma GmbH. We are in the process of transferring the manufacturing of these products to our facilities in California, which will require approvals from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency before we can relaunch the product candidates.\nBusiness Segments\nOur performance is assessed and resources are allocated based on the following two reportable segments: (1) finished pharmaceutical products and (2) API products. The finished pharmaceutical products segment currently manufactures, markets and distributes enoxaparin, naloxone, lidocaine, as well as various other critical and non-critical care drugs. The API segment currently manufactures and distributes RHI API and porcine insulin API. Information reported herein is consistent with how it is reviewed and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker. Factors used to identify our segments include markets, customers and products.\nFor more information regarding our segments, see Part II - Item 8.

<td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in sales of enoxaparin was driven by lower unit volumes, which resulted in a decrease of approximately $13.1 million, as well as lower average selling prices, which resulted in a decrease of approximately $9.6 million. We expect that the average selling price and unit volumes of enoxaparin will continue to fluctuate in the near term as a result of competition.\nLower unit volumes of naloxone led to a decrease in sales of approximately $3.8 million, while lower average selling price caused a decrease in sales of approximately $1.4 million. We anticipate that sales of this product may fluctuate due to increased competition driven by future competitor launches.\nHigher unit volumes of phytonadione led to an increase in sales of approximately $2.4 million, while higher average selling price caused an increase in sales of approximately $2.2 million. An increase in average selling prices of epinephrine caused an increase of approximately $10.4 million in net revenues, which was offset by the decrease in unit volumes which was primarily a result of the discontinuation of our epinephrine injection, USP vial product in the second quarter of 2017 in accordance with the FDA's request. Our epinephrine injection, USP vial product, was marketed under the grandfather\u201d exception to the FDA's Prescription Drug Wrap-Up\u201d program. During 2017, we recognized $17.8 million in net revenues for the sale of the discontinued vial product. The remainder of our epinephrine sales was from the pre-filled syringe, which remains on the market. Other finished pharmaceutical products increased in unit volumes due to a temporary competitor shortage.\nSales of RHI API decreased primarily because of lower shipments to MannKind in 2017.\nWe anticipate that sales of insulin API will continue to fluctuate and will likely decrease due to the inherent uncertainties related to sales of RHI API to MannKind. In addition, most of our API sales are denominated in Euros, and the fluctuation in the value of the Euro versus the dollar has had, and will continue to have, an impact on API sales revenues in the near term. In November 2016, we amended the Supply Agreement, or Supply Agreement Amendment, with MannKind, whereby MannKind's aggregate total commitment of RHI API under the Supply Agreement has not been reduced; however, the annual minimum purchase commitments of RHI API under the Supply Agreement have been modified and extended through 2023, which timeframe had previously lapsed after calendar year 2019. Specifically, the minimum annual purchase commitment in calendar year 2016 has been cancelled, and the minimum annual purchase commitments in calendar years 2017 through 2023 have been modified to be \u20ac2.7 million of insulin in the fourth quarter of 2017, \u20ac8.9 million in 2018, \u20ac11.6 million in 2019, \u20ac15.5 million in 2020 and in 2021, and \u20ac19.4 million in 2022 and in 2023. MannKind may request to purchase additional quantities of RHI API in excess of its annual minimum purchase commitments. The Supply Agreement Amendment also (i) modified, and shortened, the required expiry dates for RHI API delivered to MannKind pursuant to the Supply Agreement, (ii) modified the timing of MannKind's payment for the minimum annual purchase commitment in calendar year 2017, and (iii) added a pre-payment requirement for purchases of RHI API by MannKind in calendar years 2017 and 2018. The Supply Agreement Amendment can be renewed for additional, successive two-year terms upon 12 months' written notice, given prior to the end of the initial term or any additional two-year term.\nConcurrently with the amendment of the Supply Agreement, we amended the Option Agreement, with MannKind, which extends the timing for payment of the capacity cancellation fee for 2017 and decreases the amounts payable as capacity cancellation fees for 2018 and 2019 in the event MannKind fails to exercise its minimum annual purchase option for any given year. We recognized the cancellation fees for 2018 of $0.9 million and for 2017 of $1.5 million in net revenues in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues decreased in dollar terms due to declines in units sold, primarily related to enoxaparin and RHI API declines. Gross margins declined due to lower selling prices for enoxaparin and naloxone. In addition, for 2017, a charge of $8.5 million was recorded to adjust certain inventory to their net realizable value, including $5.5 million for enoxaparin inventory due to a decrease in the forecasted average selling price. For 2016, a charge of $7.3 million was recorded to adjust certain inventory items to their net realizable value, including $3.1 for enoxaparin inventory items and $3.3 million for epinephrine injection, USP vial inventory items and related firm inventory purchase commitments.\nDeclining average selling prices and unit volume of enoxaparin and the discontinuance of our epinephrine injection, USP vial product will continue to put downward pressure on our gross margins. However, we believe that this trend will be offset by new product launches, including neostigmine methylsulfate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and sodium nitroprusside.\nSelling, distribution, and marketing, and general and administrative\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, distribution, and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses relating to our July 2017 patent trial (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information).\nWe expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an annual basis due to increased costs associated with ongoing compliance with public company reporting obligations.\nResearch and development\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSalaries and personnel-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPre-launch inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nClinical trials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFDA fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,634)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(95)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTesting, operating and lab supplies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n41,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates, such as salaries and other personnel related expenses for employees involved with research and development activities, manufacturing pre-launch inventory, clinical trials, FDA fees, testing, operating and lab supplies, depreciation and other related expenses. We expense research and development costs as incurred.\nTesting, operating and lab supplies increased due to expenditures on materials for our pipeline products, particularly production of APIs for our pipeline at our ANP facility. FDA fees decreased in 2017 due to the NDA filing of our intranasal naloxone product candidate that was submitted in the second quarter of 2016. Pre-launch inventory increased due to pre-approval purchases of APIs for medroxyprogesterone acetate and sodium nitroprusside. Clinical trials expense increased due to spending on pilot trials for inhalation products.\nWe have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in research and development to expand our product portfolio and grow our business. These costs will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of various clinical trials, the pre-launch costs associated with new products, and FDA filing fees. As we undertake new and challenging research and development projects, we anticipate that the associated annual costs will increase significantly over the next several quarters and years.\nGain on

selling prices of enoxaparin caused a decrease of approximately $6.4 million compared to 2015, while lower unit volumes in the retail market, primarily as a result of the termination agreement with Actavis, led to a decrease in sales of enoxaparin of approximately $18.8 million compared to 2015. On June 30, 2016, we amended the distribution agreement with Actavis, which terminated the agreement in December 2016. We completed shipments to Actavis under our supply agreement in August 2016 and did not begin selling to retail customers until the end of December 2016. As a result of the termination of the Actavis agreement, the timing of sales into the retail channel may be adversely affected in the near term. We expect that the average selling price and unit volumes of enoxaparin will continue to decline in the near term as a result of competition.\nThe increase of sales of naloxone in 2016 was primarily a result of an increase in unit volumes that were partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of $1.4 million, primarily due to increased rebates. Sales of this product may decline due to future competitor launches.\nAn increase in the average selling price of lidocaine caused an increase of approximately $2.6 million in net revenues, while higher unit volumes led to an increase in sales of approximately $3.8 million compared to 2015. The increases in phytonadione and epinephrine were primarily the result of higher average selling prices. The FDA recently requested us to discontinue the manufacturing and distribution of our epinephrine injection, USP vial product, which has been marketed under the grandfather\u201d exception to the FDA's Prescription Drug Wrap-Up\u201d program. We are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding the timing of the discontinuation of this product. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $18.6 million in net revenues for the sale of this product.\nOur insulin API business had an overall decrease in sales of RHI API and porcine insulin API to $14.9 million in 2016 from $26.6 million in 2015, as MannKind purchased the remaining unfulfilled 2015 commitments, but did not purchase any of its 2016 commitments under the supply agreement entered into in 2014.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenue of enoxaparin decreased by $22.6 million compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease of $6.7 million in average cost per unit as a result of lower heparin input costs and a decrease of $16.0 million in unit volume as a result of lower sales volume. In addition, cost of revenue for insulin API decreased $7.4 million compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease in unit volume of $7.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in personnel costs at our U.S. manufacturing sites. In December 2016, we recorded a charge of $7.3 million to adjust certain inventory items to their net realizable value, including $3.1 million for enoxaparin inventory items due to a decrease in the forecasted average selling price and $3.3 million for epinephrine injection, USP vial inventory items and related firm inventory purchase commitment due to the anticipated discontinuation of the product.\nThe increase in gross margin in 2016 was driven by increased pricing on epinephrine, phytonadione and lidocaine. Partially offsetting the increases were pricing decreases of enoxaparin and naloxone and increased personnel costs at our U.S. facilities.\nSelling, distribution, and marketing, general and administrative, and impairment of long-lived assets\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, distribution, and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in personnel cost and legal fees, which was partially offset by the effect of a one-time $3.3 million settlement charge in 2015 relating to our California employment litigation.\nResearch and development\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSalaries and personnel-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPre-launch inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nClinical trials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,842)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(71)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFDA fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTesting, operating and lab supplies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n41,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase of pre-launch inventory expense compared to 2015 was due to a $1.1 million expense related to Primatene\u00ae Mist in 2016.

We expect our cash requirements to increase significantly in the foreseeable future as we sponsor clinical trials for, seek regulatory approvals of, and develop, manufacture and market our current development-stage product candidates and pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses or assets. Our future capital expenditures include projects to upgrade, expand and improve our manufacturing facilities in the United States, China, and France. Our cash obligations include the principal and interest payments due on our existing loans and lease payments, as described below and throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2017, our foreign subsidiaries collectively held $13.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash or cash equivalents held at foreign subsidiaries are not available to fund the parent company's operations in the United States. We believe that our cash reserves, operating cash flows, and borrowing availability under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect additional cash flows to be generated in the longer term from future product introductions, although there can be no assurance as to the receipt of regulatory approval for any product candidates that we are developing or the timing of any product introductions, which could be lengthy or ultimately unsuccessful.\nWe maintain a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $250 million of our common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, units, or debt securities. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWorking capital decreased $2.9 million to $120.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $123.5 million at December 31, 2016.\nCash Flows from Operations\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStatement of Cash Flow Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n39,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n38,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(38,755)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(39,501)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16,925)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7,718)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,760)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,754)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources and Use of Cash\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included net income of $4.5 million. Non-cash items were comprised of $15.4 million of depreciation and amortization, $17.1 million of share-based compensation expense, a $7.9 million change in tax related items, and a gain of $2.3 million on the sale of long-lived assets. Operating assets and liabilities changed primarily due to the timing of sales and purchases activities in the normal course of business and the timing of the related cash receipts and disbursements. In addition, the decrease in inventory was primarily related to a decrease of API and components for enoxaparin. The increase in accounts receivable was offset by an increase in accrued liabilities as an increase in prices to certain direct customers was offset by rebates to certain indirect customers.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of $35.1 million in purchases of property, machinery, and equipment, which included $12.4 million incurred in the United States, $14.4 million in France, and $8.3 million in China. Short-term investments, and restricted cash and short-term investments increased $2.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The cash used was partially offset by the receipt of the $2.0 million initial payment relating to the sale of the various ANDAs in February 2017 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information).\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of $30.7 million used to purchase treasury stock, which was partially offset by $13.8 million of proceeds received from our equity plans. Additionally, we received proceeds of $19.0 million from borrowings on a mortgage loan and an equipment line of credit, and made $9.7 million in principal payments on our long-term debt.\nDebt and Borrowing Capacity\nOur outstanding debt obligations are summarized as follows:\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShort-term debt and current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n47,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $43.0 million in unused borrowing capacity under revolving lines of credit with Cathay Bank and East West Bank. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with our debt covenants, which include a minimum current ratio, minimum debt service coverage, minimum tangible net worth, and maximum debt-to-effective-tangible-net-worth ratio, computed on a consolidated basis.\nLines of credit bear variable interest rates and are secured by inventory, accounts receivable, intangible assets, and equipment. The weighted average interest rates on lines of credit as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 3.9% and 3.5%, respectively. We have also entered into or refinanced certain mortgage and equipment loans with Cathay Bank and East West Bank, which bear variable or fixed interest rates and are secured by buildings and equipment. On certain loans with East West Bank, we have entered into fixed interest rate swap contracts to exchange the variable interests for fixed interest rates without the exchange of underlying notional debt amounts.\nFor more information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Debt.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies, which we discuss further below. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur net revenues consist principally of revenues generated from the sale of our pharmaceutical products. We also generate a small amount of revenues from contract manufacturing services. Generally, we recognize revenues at the time of product delivery to our customers. In some cases, revenues are recognized at the time of shipment when stipulated by the terms of the sale agreements. Revenues derived from contract manufacturing services are recognized when third-party products are shipped to customers, after the customer has accepted test samples of the products to be shipped.\nWe do not recognize product revenues unless the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) transfer of title has occurred, (iii) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Furthermore, we do not recognize revenues until all customer acceptance requirements have been met. We estimate and record reductions to revenues for early-payment discounts, product\nreturns, administrative and management fees, rebates and pricing adjustments, such as wholesaler chargebacks and retailer rebates, in the same period that the related revenues are recorded.\nIf actual future payments for the discounts, returns, fees, rebates and chargebacks exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted. As discussed under Accrual for Product Returns\u201d below, we are generally obligated to accept from our customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have or will soon reach their expiration dates. We establish reserves for such amounts based on historical experience and other information available at the time of sale, but the actual returns will not occur until several years after the sale. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable as of the date when made, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and negatively impacted if actual returns exceed our estimated allowances for returns.\nWe establish allowances for estimated chargebacks, rebates and product returns based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including:\nTable 219: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontract pricing and return terms of our agreements with customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwholesaler inventory levels and turnover;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nhistorical chargeback and product return rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nshelf lives of our products, which is generally two years, as is the case with enoxaparin;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndirect communication with customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nanticipated introduction of competitive products or authorized generics; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nanticipated pricing strategy changes by us and/or our competitors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Chargebacks and Rebates\nThe provision for chargebacks and rebates is a significant estimate used in the recognition of revenue. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to sales terms under which we agree to reimburse wholesalers for differences between the gross sales prices at which we sell our products to wholesalers and the actual prices of such products that wholesalers resell them under our various contractual arrangements with third parties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations in the United States. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to retailers, payers, and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements. We estimate chargebacks and rebates at the time of sale to wholesalers based on wholesaler inventory stocking levels, historic chargeback and rebate rates, and current contract pricing.\nThe provision for chargebacks and rebates is reflected in net revenues. The following table is an analysis of the chargeback and rebate provision:\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n39,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for chargebacks and rebates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n152,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n171,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCredits and payments issued to third parties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(173,250)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(147,338)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n39,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in the chargeback provision from period to period are primarily dependent on our sales to wholesalers, the level of inventory held by wholesalers, and the wholesaler's customer mix. Changes in the rebate provision from period to period are primarily dependent on retailer's and other indirect customers' purchases. The approach that we use to estimate chargebacks and rebates has been consistently applied for all periods presented. Variations in estimates have been historically small. We continually monitor the provision for chargebacks and rebates and make adjustments when we believe that the actual chargebacks and rebates may differ from the estimates. The settlement of chargebacks and rebates generally occurs within 30 days to 60 days after the sale to wholesalers. The decrease in the provision balance as of December 31, 2017 was primarily due to timing of customer purchases and a decrease in the gross sales prices of enoxaparin during the year.\nAccrual for Product Returns\nWe offer most customers the right to return qualified excess or expired inventory for partial credit; however, API product sales are generally non-returnable. Our product returns primarily consist of the returns of expired products from sales made in prior periods. Returned products cannot be resold. At the time product revenue is recognized, we record an accrual for estimated returns. The accrual is based, in part, upon the historical relationship of product returns to sales and customer contract terms. We also assess other factors that could affect product returns including market conditions, product obsolescence and the introduction of new competition. Although these factors do not normally give our customers the right to return products outside of the regular return policy, we realize that such factors could ultimately lead to increased returns. We analyze these situations on a case-by-case basis and make adjustments to the product return reserve as appropriate.\nWhen we do not have specific historical experience with actual returns for a product, we consider other available information to record a reasonable product return reserve. If we already sell products that are similar to a newly launched product, we estimate the new product return rate using historical experience of similar products. The criteria used to make the determination of whether a new product is similar to existing products includes whether it: (i) is used for the treatment of a similar type of disease or indication, (ii) has a comparable shelf life, (iii) has similar frequency of dosing, (iv) has similar types of customers, (v) is distributed in a similar manner and (vi) has similar rights of return and other comparable sales incentives. We also consider whether we have the ability to monitor inventory levels in our distribution channels to determine the underlying patient demand for a new product. We analyze the product's sell-through cycle based on wholesaler chargeback claims and customers' re-ordering patterns to determine whether the estimated product return rate is reasonable. Additionally, we consider factors such as size and maturity of the market prior to launch and the introduction of additional competition. If the available information is not sufficient to estimate a reasonable product return accrual, revenues from the sales of the new product would not be recognized until the product is consumed by the end customer or rights of return granted under the return policy have expired. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, cumulative sales of approximately $1.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for one of our products were not recognized in revenues, due to insufficient information available to estimate a reasonable product return accrual.\nOn each balance sheet date, we classify that portion of our accrual for product returns that is attributable to products that are eligible for return within 12 months following the balance sheet date as a current obligation and the remainder as a long-term obligation.\nThe provision for product returns is reflected in net revenues. The following table is an analysis of our product return liability:\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for product returns\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCredits issued to third parties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,375)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,231)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOf the provision for product returns as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $4.1 million and $1.8 million were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our aggregate product return rate was 1.3% and 1.1% of qualified sales, respectively.\nInventory\nInventories consist of currently marketed products and products manufactured under contract. Inventories are stated using the first-in, first-out method, on a consistent basis. In 2016, we prospectively adopted ASU No. 2015-11, simplifying the Measurement Inventory, and state inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We adjust inventories to their net realizable value: (i) if a launch of a new product is delayed and inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment, (ii) when a product is close to expiration and not expected to be sold, (iii) when a product has reached its expiration date, (iv) when a product is not expected to be sellable, and (v) when the net realizable value is below cost. In determining the net realizable value of an inventory item, we consider factors such as the amount of inventory on hand, its remaining shelf life, its regulatory approval status, and current and expected market conditions, including management forecasts and levels of competition.\nImpairment of Intangible and Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets and definite-lived identifiable intangible assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events and circumstances include decisions by the FDA regarding evidence of effectiveness of proprietary drug candidates or bioequivalence (sameness) of our generic product candidates as compared to the reference drug, communication with the regulatory agencies regarding the safety and efficacy of our products under review, the use of the asset in current research and development projects, any potential alternative uses of the asset in other research and development projects in the short-to-medium term, clinical trial results and research and development portfolio management options. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset groups and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset groups, further impairment analysis is performed. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset groups (assets to be held and used) or fair value less cost to sell (assets to be disposed of). All of our impairments relate primarily to the isolated write-off of certain manufacturing equipment related to abandoned projects. Since we periodically assess our product candidates and make changes to product development plans, we incur impairment charges from time to time which can fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nThe indefinite-lived intangible asset, the Primatene\u00ae trademark acquired in June 2008, and goodwill are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. An impairment loss is recorded if the asset's fair value is less than its carrying value. We also periodically review the Primatene\u00ae trademark to determine if events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. When we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step. If we determine it is more likely than not that the Primatene\u00ae trademark is impaired or the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, further quantitative impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. If the life is no longer indefinite, the asset is tested for impairment, and the carrying value, after recognition of any impairment loss, is amortized over its remaining useful life. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset and goodwill was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, or 2015, respectively.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nWe utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting of certain areas for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act.\nA number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have established a tax reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years for which we can be subject to audit varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of an audit, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that is more likely than not to occur. The resolution of a matter could be recognized as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate in the period of resolution, and may also require a use of cash.\nShare-Based Compensation\nOptions issued under our 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan, or the 2015 Plan, and our Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Award Plan, or 2005 Plan are granted at exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant and vest based on continuous service. There have been no awards with performance conditions and no awards with market conditions. The options have a contractual term of five to ten years and generally vest over a three- to five-year period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model has various inputs such as the common share price on the date of grant, exercise price, the risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected life and dividend yield, all of which are estimates. We used the risk free rate on U.S. Treasury securities at the time of grant for instruments with maturities commensurate with the expected term of the stock option. Our volatility estimate was based on the weighted average historical volatility of our stock price since IPO and the stock price from a set of peer companies, since our shares do not have sufficient trading history. We consider factors such as stage of life cycle, competitors, size, market capitalization and financial leverage in the selection of similar entities. Our dividend yield was assumed to be 0%, because we have no plans to pay dividends. We estimate the expected term of options with consideration of vesting date, contractual term, and historical experience for employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior after our common stock has been publicly traded. The expected term of plain vanilla\u201d options is estimated based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term under the simplified method.\nThe fair value of each share-based compensation award is amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the grant date for the option and the vesting date net of expected forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual numbers differ from such estimates. The change of any of these inputs could significantly impact the determination of the fair value of our options as well as significantly impact our results of operations.\nEffective January 1, 2017, the Company prospectively adopted certain requirements of Auditing Standards Update, or ASU No. 2016-09. As a result, cash flows related to excess tax benefits are classified in operating activities and all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are directly included in income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of operations without adjusting prior periods. Additionally, ASU No. 2016-09 eliminated the requirement that excess tax benefits from share-based compensation reduce taxes payable prior to being recognized in the financial statements. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, the cumulative excess benefits of stock compensation of $0.9 million that was not previously recognized was established on the balance sheet resulting in an increase in deferred tax assets and retained earnings.\nCommon Stock Valuation Prior to Our Initial Public Offering\nFor all equity grants prior to our initial public offering on June 25, 2014, we were required to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our share-based awards when performing the fair value calculations with the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair values of the common stock underlying our share-based awards were determined by our Board of Directors, with input from management and contemporaneous third-party valuations. We believe that our Board of Directors had the relevant experience and expertise to determine the fair value of our common stock. As described below, the exercise price of our share-based awards was determined by our Board of Directors based on a number of factors, including the most recent third-party valuation report as of the grant date.\nGiven the absence of a public trading market of our common stock prior to our initial public offering, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company\nEquity Securities Issued as Compensation, our Board of Directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock.\nThe dates of our valuation reports, which were prepared on a quarterly basis, were not always contemporaneous with the grant dates of our share-based awards. Therefore, in those cases where the report was not contemporaneous with the grant date of the stock based awards, we considered the amount of time between the valuation report date and the grant date to determine whether to use the latest common stock valuation report for the purposes of determining the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes. If share-based awards were granted in a short period of time preceding the date of a valuation report, we assessed the fair value of such share-based awards used for financial reporting purposes after considering the fair value reflected in the subsequent valuation report and other facts and circumstances on the date of grant as discussed below. There were significant judgments and estimates inherent in these valuations, which included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to completing an initial public offering or other liquidity event and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods to be applied.\nIn valuing our common stock, our Board of Directors determined the equity value of our business using generally accepted valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow analysis and comparable public company analysis.\nOnce calculated, the Board determined the midpoint of the results of the discounted cash flow and the market comparable approach and then weighted the two methodologies to determine an estimated enterprise value.\nOnce an enterprise value was determined, we utilized the option pricing method, or OPM, to allocate the equity value to our common stock. The OPM values each equity class by creating a series of call options on our equity value, with exercise prices based on the strike prices of derivatives. This method is generally preferred when future outcomes are difficult to predict and dissolution or liquidation is not imminent. The inability to readily sell shares of a company increases the owner's exposure to changing market conditions and increases the risk of ownership. Because of the lack of marketability and the resulting increased risk associated with ownership of a privately-held stock, an investor typically demands a higher return or yield in comparison to a similar but publicly-traded stock. An indication of the discount for lack of marketability can be developed using a put option model. A put option model values what the illiquid security holder lacks, the ability to sell his or her shares. Theoretically, a holder of an illiquid security and a put option, and a holder of an identical, but liquid security, are in the same financial position. The put option model has the benefit of being company-specific (through the use of a company-specific volatility rate), verifiable and has relatively few inputs (risk free rate, term and volatility).\nBusiness Combinations\nIf an acquired set of activities and assets is capable of being operated as a business consisting of inputs and processes from the viewpoint of a market participant, the asset acquired and liabilities assumed are a business. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair value as of that date. Fair value determinations are based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. In determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a material acquisition, we may utilize appraisals from third party valuation firms to determine fair values of some or all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, or may complete some or all of the valuations internally. In either case, we take full responsibility for the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The value of goodwill reflects the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed to the seller over the fair value of the net assets received.\nAcquisition-related costs that we incur to effect a business combination are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. When the operations of the acquired businesses were not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements, no pro forma presentations were disclosed.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have\nirrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which creates a single source of revenue guidance for companies in all industries. Subsequently, the FASB issued multiple updates. The new standard provides guidance for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects all entities that enter into contracts to provide goods or services to their customers, unless the contracts are within the scope of other accounting standards. It also provides a model for the measurement and recognition of gains and losses on the sale of certain nonfinancial assets. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required regarding customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). Based on ASU No. 2015-14 Deferral of the Effective Date, issued in August 2015, this guidance will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018, including interim periods within the year. We will adopt the standard in 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Our revenues are generated from the sale of pharmaceutical products to various customers, and the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on these transactions or on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 Leases, that is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and which requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheets as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. This guidance will become effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019, and all annual and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements for the reporting periods in which the guidance is adopted. While we continue to evaluate the provisions of ASC 842 to determine how we will be affected, the primary effect of adopting the new standard will be to record assets and obligations for current operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Footnote 16 to the consolidated financial statements provides details on the Company's current operating lease arrangements. The adoption of ASC 842 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which is aimed at providing financial statement users with more useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. The standard update changes the impairment model for financial assets measured at amortized cost, requiring presentation at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual periods during the year ended December 31, 2019. We will be required to apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is aimed at addressing certain issues regarding classifications of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows where diversity in practice was identified. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively in the first interim and each annual period in which the guidance is adopted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16 Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements, interim or annual, have not been issued. The amendments will be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, we will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments will be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively when adopted. We will adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of 2018.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01 Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. Under the updated guidance, a set is not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar assets. If the threshold is not met, the update requires that, to be a business, the set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The definition of outputs was also aligned with Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC 606, by focusing on revenue-generating activities. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018, and prospectively applicable to any transactions occurring within the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. An entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The update also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2020, and applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. We currently do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09 Scope of Modification Accounting, that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The new guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018, and applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12 Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which amends the hedge accounting model in ASC 815 to enable entities to better portray the economics of their risk management activities in the financial statements and enhance the transparency and understandability of hedge results. The amendments also simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. The new guidance is effective\nfor our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02 Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows entities to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.\nCollaboration Agreements with Medical Device Manufacturers\nIn August 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with a medical device manufacturer to develop a drug delivery system to be used by us for one of our pipeline products. As of December 31, 2017, we have paid an upfront payment of $0.5 million and have paid $1.5 million in milestone payments under this agreement, which were classified as research and development expense as the milestones were met. We are obligated to pay up to an additional $0.5 million if certain research and development milestones are met. As of December 31, 2017, no such obligation existed. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, if the medical device manufacturer is successful in the development of this drug delivery system and our pipeline products receive appropriate regulatory approval, we intend to enter into a commercial supply agreement with such medical device manufacturer for a minimum purchase of 1.0 million units during the first 12 months.\nIn October 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with a medical device manufacturer to develop a drug delivery system to be used by us for one of our pipeline products for a total of $1.6 million. As of December 31, 2017, we are obligated to pay $0.4 million, and up to an additional $1.2 million, if certain research and development milestones are met. As of December 31, 2017, no such obligation existed for the milestones. In addition, pursuant to the collaboration agreement, if the medical device manufacturer is successful in the development of this drug delivery system and our pipeline products receive appropriate regulatory approval, we intend to enter into a commercial supply agreement with such medical device manufacturer under which we are obligated to pay an additional $1.0 million, if certain commercial development milestones are met and to purchase a minimum of 100,000 units per year for three years.\nContractual Obligations\nSet forth below are our contractual payment obligations (including interest obligations but excluding intercompany obligations) as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthan\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n55,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFacility construction in Nanjing, China(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n132,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n49,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n49,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe table above excludes our liability for uncertain tax position of $7.4 million because the timing of any related payments cannot be reasonably estimated.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLong-term debt includes accrued and unpaid interest.

In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nInvestment in China\nWe entered into agreements with a Chinese governmental entity to acquire land-use rights to real property in Nanjing, China. Under the terms of these agreements, we are committed to invest capital in our wholly-owned subsidiary, ANP, and to develop these properties as an API manufacturing facility for our pipeline products. In conjunction with these agreements, ANP modified its business license on July 3, 2012, to increase its authorized capital. As of December 31, 2016, we have completed our investment of total registered capital commitment of $61.0 million to ANP. This investment in ANP resulted in cash being transferred from the U.S. parent company to ANP.\nPer these agreements, in January 2010 we acquired certain land-use rights with a carrying value of $1.2 million. In addition, we purchased additional land-use rights in November 2012 for $1.3 million. We are committed to spend approximately $15.0 million in land development. The agreements require the construction of fixed assets on the property and specified a timetable for the construction of these fixed assets. The current pace of development of the property is behind the schedules described in the purchase agreements and, per the purchase agreements, potential monetary penalties could result if the development is delayed or not completed in accordance with the guidelines stated in the purchase agreements. We are in discussions with the Chinese government regarding the development and we believe that the likelihood of incurring any penalty is remote.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products and facilities are subject to regulation by a number of federal and state governmental agencies. The Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in particular, maintains oversight of the formulation, manufacture, distribution, packaging, and labeling of all of our products. The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, maintains oversight over our products that are considered controlled substances.\nFrom January 30, 2017 through February 09, 2017, our IMS facility in South El Monte, California was subject to a preapproval inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of our corrective actions taken from the recent cGMP inspection as well as review of data to support our pending application. The inspections resulted in multiple observations on Form 483. We responded to those observations on February 14, 2017. We believe that our responses to the observations will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and that no significant further actions will be necessary.\nFrom March 13, 2017 through March 31, 2017, our Amphastar facility in Rancho Cucamonga, California was subject to a preapproval inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of our corrective actions taken from the previous cGMP inspection in July 2014 as well as review of data to support our pending applications. The inspections resulted in multiple observations on Form 483. We fully responded to those observations on April 22, 2017. We believe that our responses to the observations will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and that no significant further actions will be necessary.\nFrom April 24, 2017 through April 28, 2017, our facility in Nanjing, China was subject to an inspection by the FDA. The purpose was a pre-approval inspection for the manufacture of API. The inspection resulted in several observations on Form 483. We responded to those observations on May 19, 2017, and believe that our responses to the observations satisfied the requirements of the FDA and the inspection is considered closed.\nOn October 20, 2017, a representative from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, inspected our facility in Chino, California. The inspection covered compliance with USDA regulations regarding laboratory animal handling and well-being. No citations were made.\nFrom October 23, 2017 through October 26, 2017, our facility in Nanjing, China was subject to an inspection by the FDA. The purpose was a general cGMP inspection to cover the facility for FDA's fiscal year 2018. The inspection included a review of Quality Systems, Production Controls, Laboratory Controls, Material Management, and Facilities and Equipment Maintenance. The inspection also included a review of our corrective actions taken from the previous inspection in April 2017. There were no Form 483 observations issued.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in Item 8 under the heading Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors, include among others, those identified under the Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d above and described in greater detail elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses primarily on developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling technically challenging generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products as well as insulin API products. We currently manufacture and sell over 20 products. We are currently developing a portfolio of 15 generic abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, three generic biosimilar product candidates and six proprietary product candidates, which are in various stages of development and target a variety of indications. With respect to these product candidates, we have three ANDAs, and two NDAs on file with the FDA.\nOur largest products by net revenues currently include naloxone hydrochloride injection, lidocaine jelly and sterile solution, phytonadione injection, and enoxaparin sodium injection.\nTo complement our internal growth and expertise, we have made several strategic acquisitions of companies, products and technologies. These acquisitions collectively have strengthened our core injectable and inhalation product technology infrastructure by providing additional manufacturing, marketing, and research and development capabilities including the ability to manufacture raw materials, APIs and other components for our products.\nIncluded in these acquisitions are marketing authorizations for 33 products in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, representing 11 different injectable chemical entities, from UCB Pharma GmbH. We are in the process of transferring the manufacturing of these products to our facilities in California, which will require approvals from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency before we can relaunch the product candidates.\nBusiness Segments\nOur performance is assessed and resources are allocated based on the following two reportable segments: (1) finished pharmaceutical products and (2) API products. The finished pharmaceutical products segment currently manufactures, markets and distributes enoxaparin, naloxone, lidocaine, as well as various other critical and non-critical care drugs. The API segment currently manufactures and distributes RHI API and porcine insulin API. Information reported herein is consistent with how it is reviewed and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker. Factors used to identify our segments include markets, customers and products.\nFor more information regarding our segments, see Part II - Item 8.

<td>\n(4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in sales of enoxaparin was driven by lower unit volumes, which resulted in a decrease of approximately $13.1 million, as well as lower average selling prices, which resulted in a decrease of approximately $9.6 million. We expect that the average selling price and unit volumes of enoxaparin will continue to fluctuate in the near term as a result of competition.\nLower unit volumes of naloxone led to a decrease in sales of approximately $3.8 million, while lower average selling price caused a decrease in sales of approximately $1.4 million. We anticipate that sales of this product may fluctuate due to increased competition driven by future competitor launches.\nHigher unit volumes of phytonadione led to an increase in sales of approximately $2.4 million, while higher average selling price caused an increase in sales of approximately $2.2 million. An increase in average selling prices of epinephrine caused an increase of approximately $10.4 million in net revenues, which was offset by the decrease in unit volumes which was primarily a result of the discontinuation of our epinephrine injection, USP vial product in the second quarter of 2017 in accordance with the FDA's request. Our epinephrine injection, USP vial product, was marketed under the grandfather\u201d exception to the FDA's Prescription Drug Wrap-Up\u201d program. During 2017, we recognized $17.8 million in net revenues for the sale of the discontinued vial product. The remainder of our epinephrine sales was from the pre-filled syringe, which remains on the market. Other finished pharmaceutical products increased in unit volumes due to a temporary competitor shortage.\nSales of RHI API decreased primarily because of lower shipments to MannKind in 2017.\nWe anticipate that sales of insulin API will continue to fluctuate and will likely decrease due to the inherent uncertainties related to sales of RHI API to MannKind. In addition, most of our API sales are denominated in Euros, and the fluctuation in the value of the Euro versus the dollar has had, and will continue to have, an impact on API sales revenues in the near term. In November 2016, we amended the Supply Agreement, or Supply Agreement Amendment, with MannKind, whereby MannKind's aggregate total commitment of RHI API under the Supply Agreement has not been reduced; however, the annual minimum purchase commitments of RHI API under the Supply Agreement have been modified and extended through 2023, which timeframe had previously lapsed after calendar year 2019. Specifically, the minimum annual purchase commitment in calendar year 2016 has been cancelled, and the minimum annual purchase commitments in calendar years 2017 through 2023 have been modified to be \u20ac2.7 million of insulin in the fourth quarter of 2017, \u20ac8.9 million in 2018, \u20ac11.6 million in 2019, \u20ac15.5 million in 2020 and in 2021, and \u20ac19.4 million in 2022 and in 2023. MannKind may request to purchase additional quantities of RHI API in excess of its annual minimum purchase commitments. The Supply Agreement Amendment also (i) modified, and shortened, the required expiry dates for RHI API delivered to MannKind pursuant to the Supply Agreement, (ii) modified the timing of MannKind's payment for the minimum annual purchase commitment in calendar year 2017, and (iii) added a pre-payment requirement for purchases of RHI API by MannKind in calendar years 2017 and 2018. The Supply Agreement Amendment can be renewed for additional, successive two-year terms upon 12 months' written notice, given prior to the end of the initial term or any additional two-year term.\nConcurrently with the amendment of the Supply Agreement, we amended the Option Agreement, with MannKind, which extends the timing for payment of the capacity cancellation fee for 2017 and decreases the amounts payable as capacity cancellation fees for 2018 and 2019 in the event MannKind fails to exercise its minimum annual purchase option for any given year. We recognized the cancellation fees for 2018 of $0.9 million and for 2017 of $1.5 million in net revenues in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues decreased in dollar terms due to declines in units sold, primarily related to enoxaparin and RHI API declines. Gross margins declined due to lower selling prices for enoxaparin and naloxone. In addition, for 2017, a charge of $8.5 million was recorded to adjust certain inventory to their net realizable value, including $5.5 million for enoxaparin inventory due to a decrease in the forecasted average selling price. For 2016, a charge of $7.3 million was recorded to adjust certain inventory items to their net realizable value, including $3.1 for enoxaparin inventory items and $3.3 million for epinephrine injection, USP vial inventory items and related firm inventory purchase commitments.\nDeclining average selling prices and unit volume of enoxaparin and the discontinuance of our epinephrine injection, USP vial product will continue to put downward pressure on our gross margins. However, we believe that this trend will be offset by new product launches, including neostigmine methylsulfate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and sodium nitroprusside.\nSelling, distribution, and marketing, and general and administrative\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, distribution, and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses relating to our July 2017 patent trial (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information).\nWe expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an annual basis due to increased costs associated with ongoing compliance with public company reporting obligations.\nResearch and development\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSalaries and personnel-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPre-launch inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nClinical trials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFDA fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,634)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(95)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTesting, operating and lab supplies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n41,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates, such as salaries and other personnel related expenses for employees involved with research and development activities, manufacturing pre-launch inventory, clinical trials, FDA fees, testing, operating and lab supplies, depreciation and other related expenses. We expense research and development costs as incurred.\nTesting, operating and lab supplies increased due to expenditures on materials for our pipeline products, particularly production of APIs for our pipeline at our ANP facility. FDA fees decreased in 2017 due to the NDA filing of our intranasal naloxone product candidate that was submitted in the second quarter of 2016. Pre-launch inventory increased due to pre-approval purchases of APIs for medroxyprogesterone acetate and sodium nitroprusside. Clinical trials expense increased due to spending on pilot trials for inhalation products.\nWe have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in research and development to expand our product portfolio and grow our business. These costs will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of various clinical trials, the pre-launch costs associated with new products, and FDA filing fees. As we undertake new and challenging research and development projects, we anticipate that the associated annual costs will increase significantly over the next several quarters and years.\nGain on

selling prices of enoxaparin caused a decrease of approximately $6.4 million compared to 2015, while lower unit volumes in the retail market, primarily as a result of the termination agreement with Actavis, led to a decrease in sales of enoxaparin of approximately $18.8 million compared to 2015. On June 30, 2016, we amended the distribution agreement with Actavis, which terminated the agreement in December 2016. We completed shipments to Actavis under our supply agreement in August 2016 and did not begin selling to retail customers until the end of December 2016. As a result of the termination of the Actavis agreement, the timing of sales into the retail channel may be adversely affected in the near term. We expect that the average selling price and unit volumes of enoxaparin will continue to decline in the near term as a result of competition.\nThe increase of sales of naloxone in 2016 was primarily a result of an increase in unit volumes that were partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of $1.4 million, primarily due to increased rebates. Sales of this product may decline due to future competitor launches.\nAn increase in the average selling price of lidocaine caused an increase of approximately $2.6 million in net revenues, while higher unit volumes led to an increase in sales of approximately $3.8 million compared to 2015. The increases in phytonadione and epinephrine were primarily the result of higher average selling prices. The FDA recently requested us to discontinue the manufacturing and distribution of our epinephrine injection, USP vial product, which has been marketed under the grandfather\u201d exception to the FDA's Prescription Drug Wrap-Up\u201d program. We are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding the timing of the discontinuation of this product. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $18.6 million in net revenues for the sale of this product.\nOur insulin API business had an overall decrease in sales of RHI API and porcine insulin API to $14.9 million in 2016 from $26.6 million in 2015, as MannKind purchased the remaining unfulfilled 2015 commitments, but did not purchase any of its 2016 commitments under the supply agreement entered into in 2014.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenue of enoxaparin decreased by $22.6 million compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease of $6.7 million in average cost per unit as a result of lower heparin input costs and a decrease of $16.0 million in unit volume as a result of lower sales volume. In addition, cost of revenue for insulin API decreased $7.4 million compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease in unit volume of $7.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in personnel costs at our U.S. manufacturing sites. In December 2016, we recorded a charge of $7.3 million to adjust certain inventory items to their net realizable value, including $3.1 million for enoxaparin inventory items due to a decrease in the forecasted average selling price and $3.3 million for epinephrine injection, USP vial inventory items and related firm inventory purchase commitment due to the anticipated discontinuation of the product.\nThe increase in gross margin in 2016 was driven by increased pricing on epinephrine, phytonadione and lidocaine.

We expect our cash requirements to increase significantly in the foreseeable future as we sponsor clinical trials for, seek regulatory approvals of, and develop, manufacture and market our current development-stage product candidates and pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses or assets. Our future capital expenditures include projects to upgrade, expand and improve our manufacturing facilities in the United States, China, and France. Our cash obligations include the principal and interest payments due on our existing loans and lease payments, as described below and throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2017, our foreign subsidiaries collectively held $13.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash or cash equivalents held at foreign subsidiaries are not available to fund the parent company's operations in the United States. We believe that our cash reserves, operating cash flows, and borrowing availability under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect additional cash flows to be generated in the longer term from future product introductions, although there can be no assurance as to the receipt of regulatory approval for any product candidates that we are developing or the timing of any product introductions, which could be lengthy or ultimately unsuccessful.\nWe maintain a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $250 million of our common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, units, or debt securities. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWorking capital decreased $2.9 million to $120.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $123.5 million at December 31, 2016.\nCash Flows from Operations\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStatement of Cash Flow Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n39,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n38,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(38,755)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(39,501)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16,925)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7,718)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,760)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,754)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources and Use of Cash\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included net income of $4.5 million. Non-cash items were comprised of $15.4 million of depreciation and amortization, $17.1 million of share-based compensation expense, a $7.9 million change in tax related items, and a gain of $2.3 million on the sale of long-lived assets. Operating assets and liabilities changed primarily due to the timing of sales and purchases activities in the normal course of business and the timing of the related cash receipts and disbursements. In addition, the decrease in inventory was primarily related to a decrease of API and components for enoxaparin. The increase in accounts receivable was offset by an increase in accrued liabilities as an increase in prices to certain direct customers was offset by rebates to certain indirect customers.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of $35.1 million in purchases of property, machinery, and equipment, which included $12.4 million incurred in the United States, $14.4 million in France, and $8.3 million in China. Short-term investments, and restricted cash and short-term investments increased $2.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The cash used was partially offset by the receipt of the $2.0 million initial payment relating to the sale of the various ANDAs in February 2017 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information).\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of $30.7 million used to purchase treasury stock, which was partially offset by $13.8 million of proceeds received from our equity plans. Additionally, we received proceeds of $19.0 million from borrowings on a mortgage loan and an equipment line of credit, and made $9.7 million in principal payments on our long-term debt.\nDebt and Borrowing Capacity\nOur outstanding debt obligations are summarized as follows:\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShort-term debt and current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n47,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $43.0 million in unused borrowing capacity under revolving lines of credit with Cathay Bank and East West Bank. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with our debt covenants, which include a minimum current ratio, minimum debt service coverage, minimum tangible net worth, and maximum debt-to-effective-tangible-net-worth ratio, computed on a consolidated basis.\nLines of credit bear variable interest rates and are secured by inventory, accounts receivable, intangible assets, and equipment. The weighted average interest rates on lines of credit as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 3.9% and 3.5%, respectively. We have also entered into or refinanced certain mortgage and equipment loans with Cathay Bank and East West Bank, which bear variable or fixed interest rates and are secured by buildings and equipment. On certain loans with East West Bank, we have entered into fixed interest rate swap contracts to exchange the variable interests for fixed interest rates without the exchange of underlying notional debt amounts.\nFor more information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Debt.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies, which we discuss further below. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur net revenues consist principally of revenues generated from the sale of our pharmaceutical products. We also generate a small amount of revenues from contract manufacturing services. Generally, we recognize revenues at the time of product delivery to our customers. In some cases, revenues are recognized at the time of shipment when stipulated by the terms of the sale agreements. Revenues derived from contract manufacturing services are recognized when third-party products are shipped to customers, after the customer has accepted test samples of the products to be shipped.\nWe do not recognize product revenues unless the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) transfer of title has occurred, (iii) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Furthermore, we do not recognize revenues until all customer acceptance requirements have been met. We estimate and record reductions to revenues for early-payment discounts, product\nreturns, administrative and management fees, rebates and pricing adjustments, such as wholesaler chargebacks and retailer rebates, in the same period that the related revenues are recorded.\nIf actual future payments for the discounts, returns, fees, rebates and chargebacks exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted. As discussed under Accrual for Product Returns\u201d below, we are generally obligated to accept from our customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have or will soon reach their expiration dates. We establish reserves for such amounts based on historical experience and other information available at the time of sale, but the actual returns will not occur until several years after the sale. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable as of the date when made, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and negatively impacted if actual returns exceed our estimated allowances for returns.\nWe establish allowances for estimated chargebacks, rebates and product returns based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including:\n \u00b7 contract pricing and return terms of our agreements with customers; \n \u00b7 wholesaler inventory levels and turnover; \n \u00b7 historical chargeback and product return rates; \n \u00b7 shelf lives of our products, which is generally two years, as is the case with enoxaparin; \n \u00b7 direct communication with customers; \n \u00b7 anticipated introduction of competitive products or authorized generics; and \n \u00b7 anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and/or our competitors. \nProvision for Chargebacks and Rebates\nThe provision for chargebacks and rebates is a significant estimate used in the recognition of revenue. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to sales terms under which we agree to reimburse wholesalers for differences between the gross sales prices at which we sell our products to wholesalers and the actual prices of such products that wholesalers resell them under our various contractual arrangements with third parties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations in the United States. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to retailers, payers, and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements. We estimate chargebacks and rebates at the time of sale to wholesalers based on wholesaler inventory stocking levels, historic chargeback and rebate rates, and current contract pricing.\nThe provision for chargebacks and rebates is reflected in net revenues. The following table is an analysis of the chargeback and rebate provision:\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n39,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for chargebacks and rebates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n152,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n171,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCredits and payments issued to third parties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(173,250)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(147,338)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n39,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in the chargeback provision from period to period are primarily dependent on our sales to wholesalers, the level of inventory held by wholesalers, and the wholesaler's customer mix. Changes in the rebate provision from period to period are primarily dependent on retailer's and other indirect customers' purchases. The approach that we use to estimate chargebacks and rebates has been consistently applied for all periods presented. Variations in estimates have been historically small. We continually monitor the provision for chargebacks and rebates and make adjustments when we believe that the actual chargebacks and rebates may differ from the estimates. The settlement of chargebacks and rebates generally occurs within 30 days to 60 days after the sale to wholesalers. The decrease in the provision balance as of December 31, 2017 was primarily due to timing of customer purchases and a decrease in the gross sales prices of enoxaparin during the year.\nAccrual for Product Returns\nWe offer most customers the right to return qualified excess or expired inventory for partial credit; however, API product sales are generally non-returnable. Our product returns primarily consist of the returns of expired products from sales made in prior periods. Returned products cannot be resold. At the time product revenue is recognized, we record an accrual for estimated returns. The accrual is based, in part, upon the historical relationship of product returns to sales and customer contract terms. We also assess other factors that could affect product returns including market conditions, product obsolescence and the introduction of new competition. Although these factors do not normally give our customers the right to return products outside of the regular return policy, we realize that such factors could ultimately lead to increased returns. We analyze these situations on a case-by-case basis and make adjustments to the product return reserve as appropriate.\nWhen we do not have specific historical experience with actual returns for a product, we consider other available information to record a reasonable product return reserve. If we already sell products that are similar to a newly launched product, we estimate the new product return rate using historical experience of similar products. The criteria used to make the determination of whether a new product is similar to existing products includes whether it: (i) is used for the treatment of a similar type of disease or indication, (ii) has a comparable shelf life, (iii) has similar frequency of dosing, (iv) has similar types of customers, (v) is distributed in a similar manner and (vi) has similar rights of return and other comparable sales incentives. We also consider whether we have the ability to monitor inventory levels in our distribution channels to determine the underlying patient demand for a new product. We analyze the product's sell-through cycle based on wholesaler chargeback claims and customers' re-ordering patterns to determine whether the estimated product return rate is reasonable. Additionally, we consider factors such as size and maturity of the market prior to launch and the introduction of additional competition. If the available information is not sufficient to estimate a reasonable product return accrual, revenues from the sales of the new product would not be recognized until the product is consumed by the end customer or rights of return granted under the return policy have expired. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, cumulative sales of approximately $1.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for one of our products were not recognized in revenues, due to insufficient information available to estimate a reasonable product return accrual.\nOn each balance sheet date, we classify that portion of our accrual for product returns that is attributable to products that are eligible for return within 12 months following the balance sheet date as a current obligation and the remainder as a long-term obligation.\nThe provision for product returns is reflected in net revenues. The following table is an analysis of our product return liability:\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for product returns\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCredits issued to third parties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,375)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,231)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOf the provision for product returns as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $4.1 million and $1.8 million were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our aggregate product return rate was 1.3% and 1.1% of qualified sales, respectively.\nInventory\nInventories consist of currently marketed products and products manufactured under contract. Inventories are stated using the first-in, first-out method, on a consistent basis. In 2016, we prospectively adopted ASU No. 2015-11, simplifying the Measurement Inventory, and state inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We adjust inventories to their net realizable value: (i) if a launch of a new product is delayed and inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment, (ii) when a product is close to expiration and not expected to be sold, (iii) when a product has reached its expiration date, (iv) when a product is not expected to be sellable, and (v) when the net realizable value is below cost. In determining the net realizable value of an inventory item, we consider factors such as the amount of inventory on hand, its remaining shelf life, its regulatory approval status, and current and expected market conditions, including management forecasts and levels of competition.\nImpairment of Intangible and Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets and definite-lived identifiable intangible assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events and circumstances include decisions by the FDA regarding evidence of effectiveness of proprietary drug candidates or bioequivalence (sameness) of our generic product candidates as compared to the reference drug, communication with the regulatory agencies regarding the safety and efficacy of our products under review, the use of the asset in current research and development projects, any potential alternative uses of the asset in other research and development projects in the short-to-medium term, clinical trial results and research and development portfolio management options. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset groups and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset groups, further impairment analysis is performed. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset groups (assets to be held and used) or fair value less cost to sell (assets to be disposed of). All of our impairments relate primarily to the isolated write-off of certain manufacturing equipment related to abandoned projects. Since we periodically assess our product candidates and make changes to product development plans, we incur impairment charges from time to time which can fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nThe indefinite-lived intangible asset, the Primatene\u00ae trademark acquired in June 2008, and goodwill are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. An impairment loss is recorded if the asset's fair value is less than its carrying value. We also periodically review the Primatene\u00ae trademark to determine if events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. When we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step. If we determine it is more likely than not that the Primatene\u00ae trademark is impaired or the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, further quantitative impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. If the life is no longer indefinite, the asset is tested for impairment, and the carrying value, after recognition of any impairment loss, is amortized over its remaining useful life. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset and goodwill was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, or 2015, respectively.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nWe utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting of certain areas for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act.\nA number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have established a tax reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years for which we can be subject to audit varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of an audit, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that is more likely than not to occur. The resolution of a matter could be recognized as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate in the period of resolution, and may also require a use of cash.\nShare-Based Compensation\nOptions issued under our 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan, or the 2015 Plan, and our Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Award Plan, or 2005 Plan are granted at exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant and vest based on continuous service. There have been no awards with performance conditions and no awards with market conditions. The options have a contractual term of five to ten years and generally vest over a three- to five-year period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model has various inputs such as the common share price on the date of grant, exercise price, the risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected life and dividend yield, all of which are estimates. We used the risk free rate on U.S. Treasury securities at the time of grant for instruments with maturities commensurate with the expected term of the stock option. Our volatility estimate was based on the weighted average historical volatility of our stock price since IPO and the stock price from a set of peer companies, since our shares do not have sufficient trading history. We consider factors such as stage of life cycle, competitors, size, market capitalization and financial leverage in the selection of similar entities. Our dividend yield was assumed to be 0%, because we have no plans to pay dividends. We estimate the expected term of options with consideration of vesting date, contractual term, and historical experience for employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior after our common stock has been publicly traded. The expected term of plain vanilla\u201d options is estimated based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term under the simplified method.\nThe fair value of each share-based compensation award is amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the grant date for the option and the vesting date net of expected forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual numbers differ from such estimates. The change of any of these inputs could significantly impact the determination of the fair value of our options as well as significantly impact our results of operations.\nEffective January 1, 2017, the Company prospectively adopted certain requirements of Auditing Standards Update, or ASU No. 2016-09. As a result, cash flows related to excess tax benefits are classified in operating activities and all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are directly included in income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of operations without adjusting prior periods. Additionally, ASU No. 2016-09 eliminated the requirement that excess tax benefits from share-based compensation reduce taxes payable prior to being recognized in the financial statements. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, the cumulative excess benefits of stock compensation of $0.9 million that was not previously recognized was established on the balance sheet resulting in an increase in deferred tax assets and retained earnings.\nCommon Stock Valuation Prior to Our Initial Public Offering\nFor all equity grants prior to our initial public offering on June 25, 2014, we were required to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our share-based awards when performing the fair value calculations with the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair values of the common stock underlying our share-based awards were determined by our Board of Directors, with input from management and contemporaneous third-party valuations. We believe that our Board of Directors had the relevant experience and expertise to determine the fair value of our common stock. As described below, the exercise price of our share-based awards was determined by our Board of Directors based on a number of factors, including the most recent third-party valuation report as of the grant date.\nGiven the absence of a public trading market of our common stock prior to our initial public offering, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company\nEquity Securities Issued as Compensation, our Board of Directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock.\nThe dates of our valuation reports, which were prepared on a quarterly basis, were not always contemporaneous with the grant dates of our share-based awards. Therefore, in those cases where the report was not contemporaneous with the grant date of the stock based awards, we considered the amount of time between the valuation report date and the grant date to determine whether to use the latest common stock valuation report for the purposes of determining the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes. If share-based awards were granted in a short period of time preceding the date of a valuation report, we assessed the fair value of such share-based awards used for financial reporting purposes after considering the fair value reflected in the subsequent valuation report and other facts and circumstances on the date of grant as discussed below. There were significant judgments and estimates inherent in these valuations, which included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to completing an initial public offering or other liquidity event and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods to be applied.\nIn valuing our common stock, our Board of Directors determined the equity value of our business using generally accepted valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow analysis and comparable public company analysis.\nOnce calculated, the Board determined the midpoint of the results of the discounted cash flow and the market comparable approach and then weighted the two methodologies to determine an estimated enterprise value.\nOnce an enterprise value was determined, we utilized the option pricing method, or OPM, to allocate the equity value to our common stock. The OPM values each equity class by creating a series of call options on our equity value, with exercise prices based on the strike prices of derivatives. This method is generally preferred when future outcomes are difficult to predict and dissolution or liquidation is not imminent. The inability to readily sell shares of a company increases the owner's exposure to changing market conditions and increases the risk of ownership. Because of the lack of marketability and the resulting increased risk associated with ownership of a privately-held stock, an investor typically demands a higher return or yield in comparison to a similar but publicly-traded stock. An indication of the discount for lack of marketability can be developed using a put option model. A put option model values what the illiquid security holder lacks, the ability to sell his or her shares. Theoretically, a holder of an illiquid security and a put option, and a holder of an identical, but liquid security, are in the same financial position. The put option model has the benefit of being company-specific (through the use of a company-specific volatility rate), verifiable and has relatively few inputs (risk free rate, term and volatility).\nBusiness Combinations\nIf an acquired set of activities and assets is capable of being operated as a business consisting of inputs and processes from the viewpoint of a market participant, the asset acquired and liabilities assumed are a business. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair value as of that date. Fair value determinations are based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. In determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a material acquisition, we may utilize appraisals from third party valuation firms to determine fair values of some or all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, or may complete some or all of the valuations internally. In either case, we take full responsibility for the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The value of goodwill reflects the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed to the seller over the fair value of the net assets received.\nAcquisition-related costs that we incur to effect a business combination are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. When the operations of the acquired businesses were not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements, no pro forma presentations were disclosed.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have\nirrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which creates a single source of revenue guidance for companies in all industries. Subsequently, the FASB issued multiple updates. The new standard provides guidance for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects all entities that enter into contracts to provide goods or services to their customers, unless the contracts are within the scope of other accounting standards. It also provides a model for the measurement and recognition of gains and losses on the sale of certain nonfinancial assets. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required regarding customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). Based on ASU No. 2015-14 Deferral of the Effective Date, issued in August 2015, this guidance will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018, including interim periods within the year. We will adopt the standard in 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Our revenues are generated from the sale of pharmaceutical products to various customers, and the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on these transactions or on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 Leases, that is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and which requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheets as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. This guidance will become effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019, and all annual and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements for the reporting periods in which the guidance is adopted. While we continue to evaluate the provisions of ASC 842 to determine how we will be affected, the primary effect of adopting the new standard will be to record assets and obligations for current operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Footnote 16 to the consolidated financial statements provides details on the Company's current operating lease arrangements. The adoption of ASC 842 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which is aimed at providing financial statement users with more useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. The standard update changes the impairment model for financial assets measured at amortized cost, requiring presentation at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual periods during the year ended December 31, 2019. We will be required to apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is aimed at addressing certain issues regarding classifications of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows where diversity in practice was identified. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively in the first interim and each annual period in which the guidance is adopted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16 Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements, interim or annual, have not been issued. The amendments will be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, we will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments will be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively when adopted. We will adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of 2018.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01 Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. Under the updated guidance, a set is not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar assets. If the threshold is not met, the update requires that, to be a business, the set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The definition of outputs was also aligned with Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC 606, by focusing on revenue-generating activities. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018, and prospectively applicable to any transactions occurring within the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. An entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The update also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2020, and applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. We currently do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09 Scope of Modification Accounting, that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The new guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018, and applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12 Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which amends the hedge accounting model in ASC 815 to enable entities to better portray the economics of their risk management activities in the financial statements and enhance the transparency and understandability of hedge results. The amendments also simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. The new guidance is effective\nfor our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02 Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows entities to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.\nCollaboration Agreements with Medical Device Manufacturers\nIn August 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with a medical device manufacturer to develop a drug delivery system to be used by us for one of our pipeline products. As of December 31, 2017, we have paid an upfront payment of $0.5 million and have paid $1.5 million in milestone payments under this agreement, which were classified as research and development expense as the milestones were met. We are obligated to pay up to an additional $0.5 million if certain research and development milestones are met. As of December 31, 2017, no such obligation existed. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, if the medical device manufacturer is successful in the development of this drug delivery system and our pipeline products receive appropriate regulatory approval, we intend to enter into a commercial supply agreement with such medical device manufacturer for a minimum purchase of 1.0 million units during the first 12 months.\nIn October 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with a medical device manufacturer to develop a drug delivery system to be used by us for one of our pipeline products for a total of $1.6 million. As of December 31, 2017, we are obligated to pay $0.4 million, and up to an additional $1.2 million, if certain research and development milestones are met. As of December 31, 2017, no such obligation existed for the milestones. In addition, pursuant to the collaboration agreement, if the medical device manufacturer is successful in the development of this drug delivery system and our pipeline products receive appropriate regulatory approval, we intend to enter into a commercial supply agreement with such medical device manufacturer under which we are obligated to pay an additional $1.0 million, if certain commercial development milestones are met and to purchase a minimum of 100,000 units per year for three years.\nContractual Obligations\nSet forth below are our contractual payment obligations (including interest obligations but excluding intercompany obligations) as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthan\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n55,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFacility construction in Nanjing, China(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n132,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n49,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n49,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The table above excludes our liability for uncertain tax position of $7.4 million because the timing of any related payments cannot be reasonably estimated. \n (2) Long-term debt includes accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2017, the principal amount of long-term debt with variable interest exposure was $15.1 million. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average variable interest rate on our long-term debt was 4.5%. \n (3) Obligation to develop a facility in Nanjing, China. Please see - Investment in China\u201d below for further discussion. \n (4) The purchase obligations principally relate to inventory and pharmaceutical manufacturing and laboratory equipment. We anticipate meeting these purchase obligations through a combination of cash on hand, future cash flows from operations and debt and lease facilities. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships or financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nInvestment in China\nWe entered into agreements with a Chinese governmental entity to acquire land-use rights to real property in Nanjing, China. Under the terms of these agreements, we are committed to invest capital in our wholly-owned subsidiary, ANP, and to develop these properties as an API manufacturing facility for our pipeline products. In conjunction with these agreements, ANP modified its business license on July 3, 2012, to increase its authorized capital. As of December 31, 2016, we have completed our investment of total registered capital commitment of $61.0 million to ANP. This investment in ANP resulted in cash being transferred from the U.S. parent company to ANP.\nPer these agreements, in January 2010 we acquired certain land-use rights with a carrying value of $1.2 million. In addition, we purchased additional land-use rights in November 2012 for $1.3 million. We are committed to spend approximately $15.0 million in land development. The agreements require the construction of fixed assets on the property and specified a timetable for the construction of these fixed assets. The current pace of development of the property is behind the schedules described in the purchase agreements and, per the purchase agreements, potential monetary penalties could result if the development is delayed or not completed in accordance with the guidelines stated in the purchase agreements. We are in discussions with the Chinese government regarding the development and we believe that the likelihood of incurring any penalty is remote.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products and facilities are subject to regulation by a number of federal and state governmental agencies. The Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in particular, maintains oversight of the formulation, manufacture, distribution, packaging, and labeling of all of our products. The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, maintains oversight over our products that are considered controlled substances.\nFrom January 30, 2017 through February 09, 2017, our IMS facility in South El Monte, California was subject to a preapproval inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of our corrective actions taken from the recent cGMP inspection as well as review of data to support our pending application. The inspections resulted in multiple observations on Form 483. We responded to those observations on February 14, 2017. We believe that our responses to the observations will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and that no significant further actions will be necessary.\nFrom March 13, 2017 through March 31, 2017, our Amphastar facility in Rancho Cucamonga, California was subject to a preapproval inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of our corrective actions taken from the previous cGMP inspection in July 2014 as well as review of data to support our pending applications. The inspections resulted in multiple observations on Form 483. We fully responded to those observations on April 22, 2017. We believe that our responses to the observations will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and that no significant further actions will be necessary.\nFrom April 24, 2017 through April 28, 2017, our facility in Nanjing, China was subject to an inspection by the FDA. The purpose was a pre-approval inspection for the manufacture of API. The inspection resulted in several observations on Form 483. We responded to those observations on May 19, 2017, and believe that our responses to the observations satisfied the requirements of the FDA and the inspection is considered closed.\nOn October 20, 2017, a representative from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, inspected our facility in Chino, California. The inspection covered compliance with USDA regulations regarding laboratory animal handling and well-being. No citations were made.\nFrom October 23, 2017 through October 26, 2017, our facility in Nanjing, China was subject to an inspection by the FDA. The purpose was a general cGMP inspection to cover the facility for FDA's fiscal year 2018. The inspection included a review of Quality Systems, Production Controls, Laboratory Controls, Material Management, and Facilities and Equipment Maintenance. The inspection also included a review of our corrective actions taken from the previous inspection in April 2017. There were no Form 483 observations issued.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in Item 8 under the heading Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management.

We are currently developing a portfolio of 15 generic abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, three generic biosimilar product candidates and six proprietary product candidates, which are in various stages of development and target a variety of indications. With respect to these product candidates, we have three ANDAs, and two NDAs on file with the FDA.\nOur largest products by net revenues currently include naloxone hydrochloride injection, lidocaine jelly and sterile solution, phytonadione injection, and enoxaparin sodium injection.\nTo complement our internal growth and expertise, we have made several strategic acquisitions of companies, products and technologies. These acquisitions collectively have strengthened our core injectable and inhalation product technology infrastructure by providing additional manufacturing, marketing, and research and development capabilities including the ability to manufacture raw materials, APIs and other components for our products.\nIncluded in these acquisitions are marketing authorizations for 33 products in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, representing 11 different injectable chemical entities, from UCB Pharma GmbH. We are in the process of transferring the manufacturing of these products to our facilities in California, which will require approvals from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency before we can relaunch the product candidates.\nBusiness Segments\nOur performance is assessed and resources are allocated based on the following two reportable segments: (1) finished pharmaceutical products and (2) API products. The finished pharmaceutical products segment currently manufactures, markets and distributes enoxaparin, naloxone, lidocaine, as well as various other critical and non-critical care drugs. The API segment currently manufactures and distributes RHI API and porcine insulin API. Information reported herein is consistent with how it is reviewed and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker. Factors used to identify our segments include markets, customers and products.\nFor more information regarding our segments, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Segment Reporting Information.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nNet revenues\n\nThe decrease in net revenues of finished pharmaceutical products for 2017 was primarily due to the following changes:\n\nThe decrease in sales of enoxaparin was driven by lower unit volumes, which resulted in a decrease of approximately $13.1 million, as well as lower average selling prices, which resulted in a decrease of approximately $9.6 million. We expect that the average selling price and unit volumes of enoxaparin will continue to fluctuate in the near term as a result of competition.\nLower unit volumes of naloxone led to a decrease in sales of approximately $3.8 million, while lower average selling price caused a decrease in sales of approximately $1.4 million. We anticipate that sales of this product may fluctuate due to increased competition driven by future competitor launches.\nHigher unit volumes of phytonadione led to an increase in sales of approximately $2.4 million, while higher average selling price caused an increase in sales of approximately $2.2 million. An increase in average selling prices of epinephrine caused an increase of approximately $10.4 million in net revenues, which was offset by the decrease in unit volumes which was primarily a result of the discontinuation of our epinephrine injection, USP vial product in the second quarter of 2017 in accordance with the FDA's request. Our epinephrine injection, USP vial product, was marketed under the grandfather\u201d exception to the FDA's Prescription Drug Wrap-Up\u201d program. During 2017, we recognized $17.8 million in net revenues for the sale of the discontinued vial product. The remainder of our epinephrine sales was from the pre-filled syringe, which remains on the market. Other finished pharmaceutical products increased in unit volumes due to a temporary competitor shortage.\nSales of RHI API decreased primarily because of lower shipments to MannKind in 2017.\nWe anticipate that sales of insulin API will continue to fluctuate and will likely decrease due to the inherent uncertainties related to sales of RHI API to MannKind. In addition, most of our API sales are denominated in Euros, and the fluctuation in the value of the Euro versus the dollar has had, and will continue to have, an impact on API sales revenues in the near term. In November 2016, we amended the Supply Agreement, or Supply Agreement Amendment, with MannKind, whereby MannKind's aggregate total commitment of RHI API under the Supply Agreement has not been reduced; however, the annual minimum purchase commitments of RHI API under the Supply Agreement have been modified and extended through 2023, which timeframe had previously lapsed after calendar year 2019. Specifically, the minimum annual purchase commitment in calendar year 2016 has been cancelled, and the minimum annual purchase commitments in calendar years 2017 through 2023 have been modified to be \u20ac2.7 million of insulin in the fourth quarter of 2017, \u20ac8.9 million in 2018, \u20ac11.6 million in 2019, \u20ac15.5 million in 2020 and in 2021, and \u20ac19.4 million in 2022 and in 2023. MannKind may request to purchase additional quantities of RHI API in excess of its annual minimum purchase commitments. The Supply Agreement Amendment also (i) modified, and shortened, the required expiry dates for RHI API delivered to MannKind pursuant to the Supply Agreement, (ii) modified the timing of MannKind's payment for the minimum annual purchase commitment in calendar year 2017, and (iii) added a pre-payment requirement for purchases of RHI API by MannKind in calendar years 2017 and 2018. The Supply Agreement Amendment can be renewed for additional, successive two-year terms upon 12 months' written notice, given prior to the end of the initial term or any additional two-year term.\nConcurrently with the amendment of the Supply Agreement, we amended the Option Agreement, with MannKind, which extends the timing for payment of the capacity cancellation fee for 2017 and decreases the amounts payable as capacity cancellation fees for 2018 and 2019 in the event MannKind fails to exercise its minimum annual purchase option for any given year. We recognized the cancellation fees for 2018 of $0.9 million and for 2017 of $1.5 million in net revenues in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues decreased in dollar terms due to declines in units sold, primarily related to enoxaparin and RHI API declines. Gross margins declined due to lower selling prices for enoxaparin and naloxone. In addition, for 2017, a charge of $8.5 million was recorded to adjust certain inventory to their net realizable value, including $5.5 million for enoxaparin inventory due to a decrease in the forecasted average selling price. For 2016, a charge of $7.3 million was recorded to adjust certain inventory items to their net realizable value, including $3.1 for enoxaparin inventory items and $3.3 million for epinephrine injection, USP vial inventory items and related firm inventory purchase commitments.\nDeclining average selling prices and unit volume of enoxaparin and the discontinuance of our epinephrine injection, USP vial product will continue to put downward pressure on our gross margins. However, we believe that this trend will be offset by new product launches, including neostigmine methylsulfate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and sodium nitroprusside.\nSelling, distribution, and marketing, and general and administrative\n\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses relating to our July 2017 patent trial (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information).\nWe expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an annual basis due to increased costs associated with ongoing compliance with public company reporting obligations.\nResearch and development\n\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates, such as salaries and other personnel related expenses for employees involved with research and development activities, manufacturing pre-launch inventory, clinical trials, FDA fees, testing, operating and lab supplies, depreciation and other related expenses. We expense research and development costs as incurred.\nTesting, operating and lab supplies increased due to expenditures on materials for our pipeline products, particularly production of APIs for our pipeline at our ANP facility. FDA fees decreased in 2017 due to the NDA filing of our intranasal naloxone product candidate that was submitted in the second quarter of 2016. Pre-launch inventory increased due to pre-approval purchases of APIs for medroxyprogesterone acetate and sodium nitroprusside. Clinical trials expense increased due to spending on pilot trials for inhalation products.\nWe have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in research and development to expand our product portfolio and grow our business. These costs will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of various clinical trials, the pre-launch costs associated with new products, and FDA filing fees. As we undertake new and challenging research and development projects, we anticipate that the associated annual costs will increase significantly over the next several quarters and years.\nGain on sale of intangible assets\n\nIn February 2017, we sold the ANDAs that we acquired in March 2016 and recognized a gain of $2.6 million (see Note 3 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information).\nProvision for income tax expense (benefit)\n\nThe difference in income tax expense (benefit) in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to changes in pre-tax income positions and excess share-based compensation benefits directly recorded as income tax benefit in 2017.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\nNet revenues\n\nThe increase of net revenues of the finished pharmaceutical products for 2016 was primarily due to the following changes:\n\nLower average selling prices of enoxaparin caused a decrease of approximately $6.4 million compared to 2015, while lower unit volumes in the retail market, primarily as a result of the termination agreement with Actavis, led to a decrease in sales of enoxaparin of approximately $18.8 million compared to 2015. On June 30, 2016, we amended the distribution agreement with Actavis, which terminated the agreement in December 2016. We completed shipments to Actavis under our supply agreement in August 2016 and did not begin selling to retail customers until the end of December 2016. As a result of the termination of the Actavis agreement, the timing of sales into the retail channel may be adversely affected in the near term. We expect that the average selling price and unit volumes of enoxaparin will continue to decline in the near term as a result of competition.\nThe increase of sales of naloxone in 2016 was primarily a result of an increase in unit volumes that were partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of $1.4 million, primarily due to increased rebates. Sales of this product may decline due to future competitor launches.\nAn increase in the average selling price of lidocaine caused an increase of approximately $2.6 million in net revenues, while higher unit volumes led to an increase in sales of approximately $3.8 million compared to 2015. The increases in phytonadione and epinephrine were primarily the result of higher average selling prices. The FDA recently requested us to discontinue the manufacturing and distribution of our epinephrine injection, USP vial product, which has been marketed under the grandfather\u201d exception to the FDA's Prescription Drug Wrap-Up\u201d program. We are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding the timing of the discontinuation of this product. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $18.6 million in net revenues for the sale of this product.\nOur insulin API business had an overall decrease in sales of RHI API and porcine insulin API to $14.9 million in 2016 from $26.6 million in 2015, as MannKind purchased the remaining unfulfilled 2015 commitments, but did not purchase any of its 2016 commitments under the supply agreement entered into in 2014.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenue of enoxaparin decreased by $22.6 million compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease of $6.7 million in average cost per unit as a result of lower heparin input costs and a decrease of $16.0 million in unit volume as a result of lower sales volume. In addition, cost of revenue for insulin API decreased $7.4 million compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease in unit volume of $7.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in personnel costs at our U.S. manufacturing sites. In December 2016, we recorded a charge of $7.3 million to adjust certain inventory items to their net realizable value, including $3.1 million for enoxaparin inventory items due to a decrease in the forecasted average selling price and $3.3 million for epinephrine injection, USP vial inventory items and related firm inventory purchase commitment due to the anticipated discontinuation of the product.\nThe increase in gross margin in 2016 was driven by increased pricing on epinephrine, phytonadione and lidocaine. Partially offsetting the increases were pricing decreases of enoxaparin and naloxone and increased personnel costs at our U.S. facilities.\nSelling, distribution, and marketing, general and administrative, and impairment of long-lived assets\n\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in personnel cost and legal fees, which was partially offset by the effect of a one-time $3.3 million settlement charge in 2015 relating to our California employment litigation.\nResearch and development\n\nThe increase of pre-launch inventory expense compared to 2015 was due to a $1.1 million expense related to Primatene\u00ae Mist in 2016. Clinical trial expense decreased due to higher spending in 2015 on Primatene\u00ae Mist and intranasal naloxone. FDA fees increased in 2016 due to the NDA filing fee for intranasal naloxone. Testing, operating and lab supplies increased due to expenditures on materials for our ANDA pipeline.\nProvision for income tax expense (benefit)\n\nThe difference in income tax expense (benefit) in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to a pre-tax income in 2016 compared to a pre-tax loss in 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Requirements and Sources\nWe need capital resources to maintain and expand our business. We expect our cash requirements to increase significantly in the foreseeable future as we sponsor clinical trials for, seek regulatory approvals of, and develop, manufacture and market our current development-stage product candidates and pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses or assets. Our future capital expenditures include projects to upgrade, expand and improve our manufacturing facilities in the United States, China, and France. Our cash obligations include the principal and interest payments due on our existing loans and lease payments, as described below and throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2017, our foreign subsidiaries collectively held $13.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash or cash equivalents held at foreign subsidiaries are not available to fund the parent company's operations in the United States. We believe that our cash reserves, operating cash flows, and borrowing availability under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect additional cash flows to be generated in the longer term from future product introductions, although there can be no assurance as to the receipt of regulatory approval for any product candidates that we are developing or the timing of any product introductions, which could be lengthy or ultimately unsuccessful.\nWe maintain a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $250 million of our common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, units, or debt securities. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWorking capital decreased $2.9 million to $120.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $123.5 million at December 31, 2016.\nCash Flows from Operations\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\nSources and Use of Cash\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included net income of $4.5 million. Non-cash items were comprised of $15.4 million of depreciation and amortization, $17.1 million of share-based compensation expense, a $7.9 million change in tax related items, and a gain of $2.3 million on the sale of long-lived assets. Operating assets and liabilities changed primarily due to the timing of sales and purchases activities in the normal course of business and the timing of the related cash receipts and disbursements. In addition, the decrease in inventory was primarily related to a decrease of API and components for enoxaparin. The increase in accounts receivable was offset by an increase in accrued liabilities as an increase in prices to certain direct customers was offset by rebates to certain indirect customers.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of $35.1 million in purchases of property, machinery, and equipment, which included $12.4 million incurred in the United States, $14.4 million in France, and $8.3 million in China. Short-term investments, and restricted cash and short-term investments increased $2.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The cash used was partially offset by the receipt of the $2.0 million initial payment relating to the sale of the various ANDAs in February 2017 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information).\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of $30.7 million used to purchase treasury stock, which was partially offset by $13.8 million of proceeds received from our equity plans. Additionally, we received proceeds of $19.0 million from borrowings on a mortgage loan and an equipment line of credit, and made $9.7 million in principal payments on our long-term debt.\nDebt and Borrowing Capacity\nOur outstanding debt obligations are summarized as follows:\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $43.0 million in unused borrowing capacity under revolving lines of credit with Cathay Bank and East West Bank. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with our debt covenants, which include a minimum current ratio, minimum debt service coverage, minimum tangible net worth, and maximum debt-to-effective-tangible-net-worth ratio, computed on a consolidated basis.\nLines of credit bear variable interest rates and are secured by inventory, accounts receivable, intangible assets, and equipment. The weighted average interest rates on lines of credit as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 3.9% and 3.5%, respectively. We have also entered into or refinanced certain mortgage and equipment loans with Cathay Bank and East West Bank, which bear variable or fixed interest rates and are secured by buildings and equipment. On certain loans with East West Bank, we have entered into fixed interest rate swap contracts to exchange the variable interests for fixed interest rates without the exchange of underlying notional debt amounts.\nFor more information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Debt.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies, which we discuss further below. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur net revenues consist principally of revenues generated from the sale of our pharmaceutical products. We also generate a small amount of revenues from contract manufacturing services. Generally, we recognize revenues at the time of product delivery to our customers. In some cases, revenues are recognized at the time of shipment when stipulated by the terms of the sale agreements. Revenues derived from contract manufacturing services are recognized when third-party products are shipped to customers, after the customer has accepted test samples of the products to be shipped.\nWe do not recognize product revenues unless the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) transfer of title has occurred, (iii) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Furthermore, we do not recognize revenues until all customer acceptance requirements have been met. We estimate and record reductions to revenues for early-payment discounts, product\nreturns, administrative and management fees, rebates and pricing adjustments, such as wholesaler chargebacks and retailer rebates, in the same period that the related revenues are recorded.\nIf actual future payments for the discounts, returns, fees, rebates and chargebacks exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted. As discussed under Accrual for Product Returns\u201d below, we are generally obligated to accept from our customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have or will soon reach their expiration dates. We establish reserves for such amounts based on historical experience and other information available at the time of sale, but the actual returns will not occur until several years after the sale. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable as of the date when made, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and negatively impacted if actual returns exceed our estimated allowances for returns.\nWe establish allowances for estimated chargebacks, rebates and product returns based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including:\n \u00b7 contract pricing and return terms of our agreements with customers; \n \u00b7 wholesaler inventory levels and turnover; \n \u00b7 historical chargeback and product return rates; \n \u00b7 shelf lives of our products, which is generally two years, as is the case with enoxaparin; \n \u00b7 direct communication with customers; \n \u00b7 anticipated introduction of competitive products or authorized generics; and \n \u00b7 anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and/or our competitors. \nProvision for Chargebacks and Rebates\nThe provision for chargebacks and rebates is a significant estimate used in the recognition of revenue. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to sales terms under which we agree to reimburse wholesalers for differences between the gross sales prices at which we sell our products to wholesalers and the actual prices of such products that wholesalers resell them under our various contractual arrangements with third parties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations in the United States. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to retailers, payers, and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements. We estimate chargebacks and rebates at the time of sale to wholesalers based on wholesaler inventory stocking levels, historic chargeback and rebate rates, and current contract pricing.\nThe provision for chargebacks and rebates is reflected in net revenues. The following table is an analysis of the chargeback and rebate provision:\n\nChanges in the chargeback provision from period to period are primarily dependent on our sales to wholesalers, the level of inventory held by wholesalers, and the wholesaler's customer mix. Changes in the rebate provision from period to period are primarily dependent on retailer's and other indirect customers' purchases. The approach that we use to estimate chargebacks and rebates has been consistently applied for all periods presented. Variations in estimates have been historically small. We continually monitor the provision for chargebacks and rebates and make adjustments when we believe that the actual chargebacks and rebates may differ from the estimates. The settlement of chargebacks and rebates generally occurs within 30 days to 60 days after the sale to wholesalers. The decrease in the provision balance as of December 31, 2017 was primarily due to timing of customer purchases and a decrease in the gross sales prices of enoxaparin during the year.\nAccrual for Product Returns\nWe offer most customers the right to return qualified excess or expired inventory for partial credit; however, API product sales are generally non-returnable. Our product returns primarily consist of the returns of expired products from sales made in prior periods. Returned products cannot be resold. At the time product revenue is recognized, we record an accrual for estimated returns. The accrual is based, in part, upon the historical relationship of product returns to sales and customer contract terms. We also assess other factors that could affect product returns including market conditions, product obsolescence and the introduction of new competition. Although these factors do not normally give our customers the right to return products outside of the regular return policy, we realize that such factors could ultimately lead to increased returns. We analyze these situations on a case-by-case basis and make adjustments to the product return reserve as appropriate.\nWhen we do not have specific historical experience with actual returns for a product, we consider other available information to record a reasonable product return reserve. If we already sell products that are similar to a newly launched product, we estimate the new product return rate using historical experience of similar products. The criteria used to make the determination of whether a new product is similar to existing products includes whether it: (i) is used for the treatment of a similar type of disease or indication, (ii) has a comparable shelf life, (iii) has similar frequency of dosing, (iv) has similar types of customers, (v) is distributed in a similar manner and (vi) has similar rights of return and other comparable sales incentives. We also consider whether we have the ability to monitor inventory levels in our distribution channels to determine the underlying patient demand for a new product. We analyze the product's sell-through cycle based on wholesaler chargeback claims and customers' re-ordering patterns to determine whether the estimated product return rate is reasonable. Additionally, we consider factors such as size and maturity of the market prior to launch and the introduction of additional competition. If the available information is not sufficient to estimate a reasonable product return accrual, revenues from the sales of the new product would not be recognized until the product is consumed by the end customer or rights of return granted under the return policy have expired. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, cumulative sales of approximately $1.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for one of our products were not recognized in revenues, due to insufficient information available to estimate a reasonable product return accrual.\nOn each balance sheet date, we classify that portion of our accrual for product returns that is attributable to products that are eligible for return within 12 months following the balance sheet date as a current obligation and the remainder as a long-term obligation.\nThe provision for product returns is reflected in net revenues. The following table is an analysis of our product return liability:\n\nOf the provision for product returns as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $4.1 million and $1.8 million were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our aggregate product return rate was 1.3% and 1.1% of qualified sales, respectively.\nInventory\nInventories consist of currently marketed products and products manufactured under contract. Inventories are stated using the first-in, first-out method, on a consistent basis. In 2016, we prospectively adopted ASU No. 2015-11, simplifying the Measurement Inventory, and state inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We adjust inventories to their net realizable value: (i) if a launch of a new product is delayed and inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment, (ii) when a product is close to expiration and not expected to be sold, (iii) when a product has reached its expiration date, (iv) when a product is not expected to be sellable, and (v) when the net realizable value is below cost. In determining the net realizable value of an inventory item, we consider factors such as the amount of inventory on hand, its remaining shelf life, its regulatory approval status, and current and expected market conditions, including management forecasts and levels of competition.\nImpairment of Intangible and Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets and definite-lived identifiable intangible assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events and circumstances include decisions by the FDA regarding evidence of effectiveness of proprietary drug candidates or bioequivalence (sameness) of our generic product candidates as compared to the reference drug, communication with the regulatory agencies regarding the safety and efficacy of our products under review, the use of the asset in current research and development projects, any potential alternative uses of the asset in other research and development projects in the short-to-medium term, clinical trial results and research and development portfolio management options. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset groups and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset groups, further impairment analysis is performed. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset groups (assets to be held and used) or fair value less cost to sell (assets to be disposed of). All of our impairments relate primarily to the isolated write-off of certain manufacturing equipment related to abandoned projects. Since we periodically assess our product candidates and make changes to product development plans, we incur impairment charges from time to time which can fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nThe indefinite-lived intangible asset, the Primatene\u00ae trademark acquired in June 2008, and goodwill are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. An impairment loss is recorded if the asset's fair value is less than its carrying value. We also periodically review the Primatene\u00ae trademark to determine if events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. When we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step. If we determine it is more likely than not that the Primatene\u00ae trademark is impaired or the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, further quantitative impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. If the life is no longer indefinite, the asset is tested for impairment, and the carrying value, after recognition of any impairment loss, is amortized over its remaining useful life. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset and goodwill was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, or 2015, respectively.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nWe utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting of certain areas for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act.\nA number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have established a tax reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years for which we can be subject to audit varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of an audit, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that is more likely than not to occur. The resolution of a matter could be recognized as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate in the period of resolution, and may also require a use of cash.\nShare-Based Compensation\nOptions issued under our 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan, or the 2015 Plan, and our Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Award Plan, or 2005 Plan are granted at exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant and vest based on continuous service. There have been no awards with performance conditions and no awards with market conditions. The options have a contractual term of five to ten years and generally vest over a three- to five-year period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model has various inputs such as the common share price on the date of grant, exercise price, the risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected life and dividend yield, all of which are estimates. We used the risk free rate on U.S. Treasury securities at the time of grant for instruments with maturities commensurate with the expected term of the stock option. Our volatility estimate was based on the weighted average historical volatility of our stock price since IPO and the stock price from a set of peer companies, since our shares do not have sufficient trading history. We consider factors such as stage of life cycle, competitors, size, market capitalization and financial leverage in the selection of similar entities. Our dividend yield was assumed to be 0%, because we have no plans to pay dividends. We estimate the expected term of options with consideration of vesting date, contractual term, and historical experience for employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior after our common stock has been publicly traded. The expected term of plain vanilla\u201d options is estimated based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term under the simplified method.\nThe fair value of each share-based compensation award is amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the grant date for the option and the vesting date net of expected forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual numbers differ from such estimates. The change of any of these inputs could significantly impact the determination of the fair value of our options as well as significantly impact our results of operations.\nEffective January 1, 2017, the Company prospectively adopted certain requirements of Auditing Standards Update, or ASU No. 2016-09. As a result, cash flows related to excess tax benefits are classified in operating activities and all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are directly included in income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of operations without adjusting prior periods. Additionally, ASU No. 2016-09 eliminated the requirement that excess tax benefits from share-based compensation reduce taxes payable prior to being recognized in the financial statements. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, the cumulative excess benefits of stock compensation of $0.9 million that was not previously recognized was established on the balance sheet resulting in an increase in deferred tax assets and retained earnings.\nCommon Stock Valuation Prior to Our Initial Public Offering\nFor all equity grants prior to our initial public offering on June 25, 2014, we were required to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our share-based awards when performing the fair value calculations with the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair values of the common stock underlying our share-based awards were determined by our Board of Directors, with input from management and contemporaneous third-party valuations. We believe that our Board of Directors had the relevant experience and expertise to determine the fair value of our common stock. As described below, the exercise price of our share-based awards was determined by our Board of Directors based on a number of factors, including the most recent third-party valuation report as of the grant date.\nGiven the absence of a public trading market of our common stock prior to our initial public offering, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company\nEquity Securities Issued as Compensation, our Board of Directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock.\nThe dates of our valuation reports, which were prepared on a quarterly basis, were not always contemporaneous with the grant dates of our share-based awards. Therefore, in those cases where the report was not contemporaneous with the grant date of the stock based awards, we considered the amount of time between the valuation report date and the grant date to determine whether to use the latest common stock valuation report for the purposes of determining the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes. If share-based awards were granted in a short period of time preceding the date of a valuation report, we assessed the fair value of such share-based awards used for financial reporting purposes after considering the fair value reflected in the subsequent valuation report and other facts and circumstances on the date of grant as discussed below. There were significant judgments and estimates inherent in these valuations, which included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to completing an initial public offering or other liquidity event and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods to be applied.\nIn valuing our common stock, our Board of Directors determined the equity value of our business using generally accepted valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow analysis and comparable public company analysis.\nOnce calculated, the Board determined the midpoint of the results of the discounted cash flow and the market comparable approach and then weighted the two methodologies to determine an estimated enterprise value.\nOnce an enterprise value was determined, we utilized the option pricing method, or OPM, to allocate the equity value to our common stock. The OPM values each equity class by creating a series of call options on our equity value, with exercise prices based on the strike prices of derivatives. This method is generally preferred when future outcomes are difficult to predict and dissolution or liquidation is not imminent. The inability to readily sell shares of a company increases the owner's exposure to changing market conditions and increases the risk of ownership. Because of the lack of marketability and the resulting increased risk associated with ownership of a privately-held stock, an investor typically demands a higher return or yield in comparison to a similar but publicly-traded stock. An indication of the discount for lack of marketability can be developed using a put option model. A put option model values what the illiquid security holder lacks, the ability to sell his or her shares. Theoretically, a holder of an illiquid security and a put option, and a holder of an identical, but liquid security, are in the same financial position. The put option model has the benefit of being company-specific (through the use of a company-specific volatility rate), verifiable and has relatively few inputs (risk free rate, term and volatility).\nBusiness Combinations\nIf an acquired set of activities and assets is capable of being operated as a business consisting of inputs and processes from the viewpoint of a market participant, the asset acquired and liabilities assumed are a business. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair value as of that date. Fair value determinations are based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. In determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a material acquisition, we may utilize appraisals from third party valuation firms to determine fair values of some or all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, or may complete some or all of the valuations internally. In either case, we take full responsibility for the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The value of goodwill reflects the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed to the seller over the fair value of the net assets received.\nAcquisition-related costs that we incur to effect a business combination are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. When the operations of the acquired businesses were not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements, no pro forma presentations were disclosed.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have\nirrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which creates a single source of revenue guidance for companies in all industries. Subsequently, the FASB issued multiple updates. The new standard provides guidance for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects all entities that enter into contracts to provide goods or services to their customers, unless the contracts are within the scope of other accounting standards. It also provides a model for the measurement and recognition of gains and losses on the sale of certain nonfinancial assets. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required regarding customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). Based on ASU No. 2015-14 Deferral of the Effective Date, issued in August 2015, this guidance will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018, including interim periods within the year. We will adopt the standard in 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Our revenues are generated from the sale of pharmaceutical products to various customers, and the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on these transactions or on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 Leases, that is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and which requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheets as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. This guidance will become effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019, and all annual and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements for the reporting periods in which the guidance is adopted. While we continue to evaluate the provisions of ASC 842 to determine how we will be affected, the primary effect of adopting the new standard will be to record assets and obligations for current operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Footnote 16 to the consolidated financial statements provides details on the Company's current operating lease arrangements. The adoption of ASC 842 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which is aimed at providing financial statement users with more useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. The standard update changes the impairment model for financial assets measured at amortized cost, requiring presentation at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual periods during the year ended December 31, 2019. We will be required to apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is aimed at addressing certain issues regarding classifications of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows where diversity in practice was identified. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively in the first interim and each annual period in which the guidance is adopted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16 Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements, interim or annual, have not been issued. The amendments will be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, we will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments will be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively when adopted. We will adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of 2018.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01 Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. Under the updated guidance, a set is not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar assets. If the threshold is not met, the update requires that, to be a business, the set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The definition of outputs was also aligned with Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC 606, by focusing on revenue-generating activities. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018, and prospectively applicable to any transactions occurring within the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. An entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The update also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2020, and applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. We currently do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09 Scope of Modification Accounting, that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The new guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018, and applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12 Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which amends the hedge accounting model in ASC 815 to enable entities to better portray the economics of their risk management activities in the financial statements and enhance the transparency and understandability of hedge results. The amendments also simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. The new guidance is effective\nfor our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02 Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows entities to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act. The guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.\nCollaboration Agreements with Medical Device Manufacturers\nIn August 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with a medical device manufacturer to develop a drug delivery system to be used by us for one of our pipeline products. As of December 31, 2017, we have paid an upfront payment of $0.5 million and have paid $1.5 million in milestone payments under this agreement, which were classified as research and development expense as the milestones were met. We are obligated to pay up to an additional $0.5 million if certain research and development milestones are met. As of December 31, 2017, no such obligation existed. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, if the medical device manufacturer is successful in the development of this drug delivery system and our pipeline products receive appropriate regulatory approval, we intend to enter into a commercial supply agreement with such medical device manufacturer for a minimum purchase of 1.0 million units during the first 12 months.\nIn October 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with a medical device manufacturer to develop a drug delivery system to be used by us for one of our pipeline products for a total of $1.6 million. As of December 31, 2017, we are obligated to pay $0.4 million, and up to an additional $1.2 million, if certain research and development milestones are met. As of December 31, 2017, no such obligation existed for the milestones. In addition, pursuant to the collaboration agreement, if the medical device manufacturer is successful in the development of this drug delivery system and our pipeline products receive appropriate regulatory approval, we intend to enter into a commercial supply agreement with such medical device manufacturer under which we are obligated to pay an additional $1.0 million, if certain commercial development milestones are met and to purchase a minimum of 100,000 units per year for three years.\nContractual Obligations\nSet forth below are our contractual payment obligations (including interest obligations but excluding intercompany obligations) as of December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) The table above excludes our liability for uncertain tax position of $7.4 million because the timing of any related payments cannot be reasonably estimated. \n (2) Long-term debt includes accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2017, the principal amount of long-term debt with variable interest exposure was $15.1 million. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average variable interest rate on our long-term debt was 4.5%. \n (3) Obligation to develop a facility in Nanjing, China. Please see - Investment in China\u201d below for further discussion. \n (4) The purchase obligations principally relate to inventory and pharmaceutical manufacturing and laboratory equipment. We anticipate meeting these purchase obligations through a combination of cash on hand, future cash flows from operations and debt and lease facilities. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships or financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nInvestment in China\nWe entered into agreements with a Chinese governmental entity to acquire land-use rights to real property in Nanjing, China. Under the terms of these agreements, we are committed to invest capital in our wholly-owned subsidiary, ANP, and to develop these properties as an API manufacturing facility for our pipeline products. In conjunction with these agreements, ANP modified its business license on July 3, 2012, to increase its authorized capital. As of December 31, 2016, we have completed our investment of total registered capital commitment of $61.0 million to ANP. This investment in ANP resulted in cash being transferred from the U.S. parent company to ANP.\nPer these agreements, in January 2010 we acquired certain land-use rights with a carrying value of $1.2 million. In addition, we purchased additional land-use rights in November 2012 for $1.3 million. We are committed to spend approximately $15.0 million in land development. The agreements require the construction of fixed assets on the property and specified a timetable for the construction of these fixed assets. The current pace of development of the property is behind the schedules described in the purchase agreements and, per the purchase agreements, potential monetary penalties could result if the development is delayed or not completed in accordance with the guidelines stated in the purchase agreements. We are in discussions with the Chinese government regarding the development and we believe that the likelihood of incurring any penalty is remote.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products and facilities are subject to regulation by a number of federal and state governmental agencies. The Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in particular, maintains oversight of the formulation, manufacture, distribution, packaging, and labeling of all of our products. The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, maintains oversight over our products that are considered controlled substances.\nFrom January 30, 2017 through February 09, 2017, our IMS facility in South El Monte, California was subject to a preapproval inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of our corrective actions taken from the recent cGMP inspection as well as review of data to support our pending application. The inspections resulted in multiple observations on Form 483. We responded to those observations on February 14, 2017. We believe that our responses to the observations will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and that no significant further actions will be necessary.\nFrom March 13, 2017 through March 31, 2017, our Amphastar facility in Rancho Cucamonga, California was subject to a preapproval inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of our corrective actions taken from the previous cGMP inspection in July 2014 as well as review of data to support our pending applications. The inspections resulted in multiple observations on Form 483. We fully responded to those observations on April 22, 2017. We believe that our responses to the observations will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and that no significant further actions will be necessary.\nFrom April 24, 2017 through April 28, 2017, our facility in Nanjing, China was subject to an inspection by the FDA. The purpose was a pre-approval inspection for the manufacture of API. The inspection resulted in several observations on Form 483. We responded to those observations on May 19, 2017, and believe that our responses to the observations satisfied the requirements of the FDA and the inspection is considered closed.\nOn October 20, 2017, a representative from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, inspected our facility in Chino, California. The inspection covered compliance with USDA regulations regarding laboratory animal handling and well-being. No citations were made.\nFrom October 23, 2017 through October 26, 2017, our facility in Nanjing, China was subject to an inspection by the FDA. The purpose was a general cGMP inspection to cover the facility for FDA's fiscal year 2018. The inspection included a review of Quality Systems, Production Controls, Laboratory Controls, Material Management, and Facilities and Equipment Maintenance. The inspection also included a review of our corrective actions taken from the previous inspection in April 2017. There were no Form 483 observations issued.", "item_7_tables": "Table 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
