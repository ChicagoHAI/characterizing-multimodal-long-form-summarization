Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nImpact of COVID-19\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 significantly impacted the global economy. The impact has been profound, has continued through the fourth quarter of 2020 and is likely to persist for months to come. While many businesses have re-opened, vaccinations have begun and leading economic indicators are showing signs of improvement, the overall extent and duration of COVID-19's impact on businesses and economic activity generally remains unclear. A recession in the near term remains possible. Economic effects from COVID-19, which have impacted virtually all countries and industries, include:\n\u2022Many small and large businesses being forced to interrupt their operations and as a result, lay off employees or even close;\n\u2022The re-opening and subsequent shuttering again of certain businesses in various countries around the world;\n\u2022Temporary large-scale population lock-downs, domestic and international travel restrictions and social-distancing measures were implemented, driving sharp declines in consumer and business spending. Further, while many businesses have re-opened, some are only allowing limited capacity, imposing social distancing restrictions and providing limited hours of operation, and while consumer spending has improved during the second half of 2020, uncertainty remains;\n\u2022Schools, many of which were shuttered during the first quarter, have allowed students to return to in-person instruction, but the constant concern and uncertainty of whether an outbreak may occur, have forced many schools to re-implement remote instruction, creating significant strain and uncertainty for working parents, which may slow or reverse the economic recovery;\n\u2022Significant declines and increased volatility impacted global financial markets during the first quarter, including 23.2% and 20.0% declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( Dow\u201d) and S&P 500 Index ( S&P\u201d), respectively. Although the financial markets recovered their first quarter losses to new highs in the months since, the prospect of continued volatility remains, especially given the uncertainty surrounding the continued economic effects of the virus (please see \"Market Environment\" below for additional details).\n\u2022The initial distribution of multiple COVID-19 vaccinations was initiated in the later part of the fourth quarter, but the speed, selective nature and logistical challenges of distribution, and the concerns in some communities around the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, have caused turmoil for many, further heightening the anxiety around the virus.\nGovernments around the world have responded to COVID-19 with economic stimulus measures, including a $2 trillion emergency relief bill passed in the U.S during the first quarter of 2020 and an additional $900 billion in aid passed during the fourth quarter of 2020. Similar fiscal stimulus was passed by many governments around the world. These measures and possible additional stimulus and aid measures are intended to steady businesses and consumers until economic activity meaningfully recovers. The timing and magnitude of any such recovery, however, remains uncertain.\nVarious countries around the world have continued to experience surges in the rates of COVID-19 infections, which are likely the result of greatly increased social interactions, including at colleges and universities, after re-opening of economies, as well as more contagious strains of the virus. As a result, several countries have paused the continued progression of their re-openings or re-imposed closing mandates on certain businesses, such as bars, restaurants and entertainment venues. These circumstances may adversely affect consumer sentiment and the pace of business re-openings, and they also may delay any economic recovery.\nAB Impact\nAt the initial onset of COVID-19 during the first quarter of 2020, we quickly responded in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the U.S., the U.K., Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore and Taiwan. We implemented business continuity measures, including travel restrictions and a work-from-home requirement for almost all personnel (other than a relatively small number of employees whose physical presence in our offices was considered critical), which has remained in place (except in our Asia offices, most of which have reopened) throughout the second, third and fourth quarters, to ensure operating continuity for all critical functions. We also instituted a notification process for any employee who tests positive for COVID-19 or has been exposed to someone else who has tested positive. As the COVID-19 crisis has continued to evolve since the lockdown in the first quarter, certain key functions of the business, such as Risk Management, Business Continuity, Finance and Human Capital, have maintained constant communication and monitored the evolution of the pandemic to keep our employees safe and advise of key developments. Additionally, we continue to monitor communications from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure we have current information.\nWe have continued to enhance our technology, which has increased the effectiveness of our remote work force. We have also continued to enhance our virtual programs to support business functions, such as training on cybersecurity and enhancements to our existing technology platforms. There has been a heightened focus on the emotional well-being of our employees, and we have provided regular touch points with employees through virtual town halls and management communications. Additionally, we have maintained regular communications and updates on the virus and the Company's response, which are posted on the Company's internal website, to ensure transparent communication with our employees. If any of our employees test positive for COVID-19 or interact with someone who has the virus, they are required to contact AB immediately for support and contact-tracing.\nWe continue to consider, and in some cases methodically implement, return to office programs for our U.S., European and Asia offices. However, we continue to monitor the daily evolution of the crisis in order to ensure the health and safety of our employees remains our top priority. We will modify our return to office plans, as needed, to ensure the safety of our employees and to ensure that the highest safety and cleanliness protocols are followed. We believe that our business continuity plan and technology platform will continue to support the effectiveness of our employees working remotely.\nAsset managers, such as AB, rely heavily on the performance of the financial markets largely to determine assets under management ( AUM\u201d) and revenues. Our results during the first quarter of 2020 were strong, which was primarily a reflection of financial market conditions during January and February, which were not adversely affected by COVID-19. Market conditions deteriorated dramatically during March, which negatively impacted our performance in that month. Financial markets, and hence our performance, rebounded during the ensuing months, primarily due to a U.S. Federal Government stimulus package and U.S. Treasury programs, which were instituted during March 2020 and throughout the second quarter. These programs renewed confidence in the financial markets by introducing liquidity through government purchasing of financial instruments. As various states and countries around the world eased restrictions on business and lockdown protocols during the second quarter and increasingly throughout the third and fourth quarters, increases in consumer spending, decreases in the unemployment rate and improvement in other leading economic indicators have stimulated domestic and global financial market performance. As a result of these developments, our AUM has increased in the second, third and fourth quarters. However, as U.S. states and countries globally have continued to ease restrictions, there has been a resurgence in the spread of the virus, causing certain states and countries to, among other things, shutter some businesses again or impose new social distancing restrictions. As a result, market volatility continues.\nThe economic impact of COVID-19 and any additional declines in the financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our AUM and revenues, particularly if economic activity does not continue to recover. Although countries throughout the world continue to grapple with re-opening their economies, this will continue to be a gradual process, and there is a significant risk that the opening process may be further interrupted if infection rates increase. Also, although unemployment rates have declined, they are still considered high and any reluctance of consumers to resume spending will do long-term damage to the global economy, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, as most of our workforce is working remotely, we are mindful of increased risk related to cybersecurity, which could significantly disrupt our business functions.\nUltimately, the return to normal business and economic activity will likely require the broad application of effective vaccines. Although the distribution of multiple vaccines was initiated towards the end of the fourth quarter, the speed, selective nature of those who are eligible to receive the vaccination, as well as logistical challenges regarding availability and distribution of the vaccines, could mean many months until the general population has been vaccinated.\nExecutive Overview\nPercentage change figures are calculated using assets under management rounded to the nearest million and financial statement amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.\nOur total assets under management (\"AUM\") as of December 31, 2020 were $685.9 billion, up $63.0 billion, or 10.1%, during 2020. The increase was driven primarily by market appreciation of $65.4 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $2.6 billion (due to Private Wealth Management net outflows of $2.0 billion and Retail net outflows of $1.6 billion, offset by Institutional net inflows of $1.0 billion). Excluding AXA's redemption of low-fee fixed income mandates of $11.8 billion, the firm generated net inflows of $9.2 billion in 2020.\nInstitutional AUM increased $32.9 billion, or 11.6%, to $315.6 billion during 2020, primarily due to market appreciation of $30.5 billion and net inflows of $1.0 billion. Gross sales increased $13.8 billion, from $17.1 billion in 2019 to $30.9 billion in 2020. Redemptions and terminations increased $11.3 billion, from $12.0 billion in 2019 to $23.3 billion in 2020. Excluding AXA's redemption of low-fee fixed income mandates of $11.8 billion, institutional net inflows were $12.8 billion in 2020.\nRetail AUM increased $26.1 billion, or 10.9%, to $265.3 billion during 2020, primarily due to market appreciation of $28.1 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $1.6 billion. Gross sales increased $3.6 billion, from $75.3 billion in 2019 to $78.9\nbillion in 2020. Redemptions and terminations increased $25.5 billion, from $44.0 billion in 2019 to $69.5 billion in 2020, due to record first quarter 2020 redemptions, reflecting the financial market sell-off in March amidst the onset of COVID-19.\nPrivate Wealth Management AUM increased $4.0 billion, or 3.9%, to $105.0 billion during 2020, primarily due to market appreciation of $6.8 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $2.0 billion. Gross sales increased $3.0 billion, from $11.3 billion in 2019 to $14.3 billion in 2020. Redemptions and terminations increased $4.1 billion, from $12.4 billion in 2019 to $16.5 billion in 2020.\nBernstein Research Services revenue increased $51.8 million, or 12.7%, in 2020. The increase was due to higher market volatility, particularly between March and June 2020, primarily as a result of COVID-19, which led to higher customer activity and greater global trading volumes. We expect customer activity and trading volumes to gradually decrease in 2021 and to normalize in 2022, as the volatility surrounding COVID-19 begins to decline. Any decreases in customer activity and trading volumes will have a corresponding effect on Bernstein Research services revenue. Furthermore, all of 2020 reflects the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Autonomous Research (\"Autonomous\"), which closed on April 1, 2019.\nOur 2020 net revenues of $3.7 billion increased $190.1 million, or 5.4%, compared to the prior year's net revenues. The most significant contributors to the increase were higher base advisory fees of $90.4 million, higher distribution revenues of $74.7 million, higher Bernstein Research Services revenue of $51.8 million and higher performance-based fees of $33.0 million, partially offset by higher investment losses of $55.1 million and lower net dividend and interest income of $11.9 million. Our operating expenses of $2.8 billion increased $106.1 million, or 3.9%, compared to the prior year's expenses. The increase primarily was due to higher promotion and servicing expenses of $63.6 million, higher employee compensation and benefits of $51.4 million and higher general and administrative expenses (including real estate charges) of $3.0 million, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets of $7.4 million and lower interest on borrowings of $6.9 million. Our operating income increased $84.0 million, or 10.2%, to $907.4 million from $823.4 million in 2019 and our operating margin increased from 22.6% in 2019 to 24.6% in 2020.\nMarket Environment\nDespite 2020 being a year marked by a global pandemic, record-breaking recession and unemployment levels, and a contentious U.S. presidential election, equity markets closed the year with solid gains. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq each rallied for most of the fourth quarter, finishing the year in positive territory. In the U.S., the presidential election passed with a market-friendly outcome, the distribution of multiple COVID-19 vaccines was initiated and the unemployment rate continued to decline. Meanwhile, after months of deadlock, a COVID-19 relief package was passed in the fourth quarter, consisting of direct payments, unemployment benefits and small business aid. However, even with the increasing likelihood of COVID-19 vaccines potentially boosting activity in 2021, significant slack in the economy and labor market by the end of this year are likely. As a result, the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely keep interest rates near zero as the economy improves.\nIn the U.K., COVID-19 and Brexit uncertainty resulted in the worst performing year for its equity market since the 2008 financial crisis. However, with a Brexit deal reached in the final days of 2020 between the U.K. and the E.U. and the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine, the U.K. economy may rebound in 2021. The Bank of England is likely to keep rates on hold during the recovery phase. In China, the economy has returned to almost pre-pandemic output levels. Chinese efforts to re-center the economy on a consumer-led model are expected to continue and fiscal policy will likely remain supportive through 2021. More stimulus may be announced in the first quarter of 2021 as the government continues to support consumption. While the economic outlook for China in 2021 appears positive, one big unknown is the future of the relationship between China and the new U.S. administration.\nMiFID II\nIn Europe, MiFID II, which became effective on January 3, 2018, has made significant modifications to the manner in which European broker-dealers can be compensated for research. These modifications are believed to have significantly reduced the overall research spend by European buy-side firms, which has decreased the revenues we derive from our European clients. Our European clients may continue to reduce their research budgets, which could result in a significant decline in our sell-side revenues.\nAlso, while MiFID II is not applicable to firms operating outside of Europe, competitive and client pressures may force buy-side firms operating outside of Europe to pay for research from their own resources instead of through bundled trading commissions. If that occurs, we would expect that research budgets from those clients will decrease further, which could result in an additional significant decline in our sell-side revenues. Additionally, these competitive and client pressures may result in our buy-side operation paying for research out of our own resources instead of through bundled trading commissions, which could increase our firm's expenses and decrease our operating income.\nThe ultimate impact of MiFID II on payments for research globally remains uncertain.\nEquitable Holdings IPO\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, AXA S.A. (\"AXA\") completed the sale of a minority stake in Equitable Holdings, Inc. ( EQH\u201d) through an initial public offering (\"IPO\"). Since then, AXA has completed additional offerings and taken other steps, most recently during the fourth quarter of 2019. As a result, AXA owned less than 10% of the outstanding common stock of EQH as of December 31, 2020.\nWhile we cannot at this time predict the full impact on AB of this transaction, such impact has included a reduction in the support AXA provided to AB in the past with respect to AB's investment management business, resulting in a modest decrease in our revenues and ability to initiate new investment services. Also, AB relies on AXA, including its subsidiary, AXA Business Services, for several significant services and AB has benefited from its affiliation with AXA in certain common vendor relationships. Some of these arrangements have changed, and others are expected to change, with immaterial financial implications for AB.\nOur ending AUM at December 31, 2020 reflects $11.8 billion in 2020 outflows resulting from AXA's redemption of certain low-fee fixed income mandates. We expect these redemptions to total approximately $14 billion, with the remaining redemptions expected to be completed during the first half of 2021. The revenue we earn from the management of these assets is not significant.\nRelocation Strategy\nOn May 2, 2018, we announced that we would establish our corporate headquarters in, and relocate approximately 1,050 jobs located in the New York metro area to, Nashville, TN. Subsequently, on January 14, 2020, we announced our plans to relocate an additional 200 jobs to Nashville thereby increasing the total relocated jobs to 1,250. The decision to add the additional jobs was the result of the growth in our business, select investments we are making, and the in-sourcing of roles typically performed by consultants. Our Nashville headquarters will house Finance, IT, Operations, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, Human Capital, and Sales and Marketing. We have been actively relocating jobs and expect this transition to take several years. We will continue to maintain a principal location in New York City, which will house our Portfolio Management, Sell-Side Research and Trading, and New York-based Private Wealth Management businesses.\nWe believe relocating our corporate headquarters to Nashville will afford us the opportunity to provide an improved quality of life alternative for our employees and enable us to attract and recruit new talented employees to a highly desirable location while improving the long-term cost structure of the firm.\nDuring the transition period, which began in 2018 and is expected to continue through 2024, we currently estimate we will incur transition costs of approximately $145 million to $155 million, which is less than our previous estimate of $155 million to $165 million. These costs include employee relocation, severance, recruitment, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. Over this same period, we expect to realize total expense savings of approximately $205 million to $215 million, which is greater than our previous estimate of $185 million to $195 million, and is an amount greater than the total transition costs. However, we did incur some transition costs before we began to realize expense savings. For the period beginning in 2018 and ending in 2020, we incurred $70 million of cumulative transition costs compared to $46 million of cumulative savings. In 2020, expense savings of $30 million were greater than transition costs of $26 million, resulting in a net increase of $0.01 in net income per unit ( EPU\u201d). We currently anticipate an EPU increase in 2021 of approximately $0.02 and expect to achieve increasing EPU accretion in each year thereafter. Beginning in 2025, once the transition period has been completed, we estimate ongoing annual expense savings towards the upper end of the range of $75 million to $80 million, which will result from a combination of occupancy and compensation-related savings. Our estimates for both the transition costs and the corresponding expense savings are based upon our current assumptions of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. In addition, our estimates for both the timing of when we incur transition costs and realize the related expense savings are based on our current relocation implementation plan and the timing for execution of each phase. The actual total charges we eventually record, the related expense savings we realize, and timing of EPU impact may differ from our current estimates as we implement each phase of our headquarters relocation.\nDuring October 2018, we signed a lease, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020, relating to 218,976 square feet of space at our new Nashville headquarters. Our estimated total base rent obligation (excluding taxes, operating expenses and utilities) over the 15-year initial lease term is $134 million.\nAlthough we have presented our transition costs and annual expense savings with numerical specificity, and we believe these targets to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions we discuss above create a significant risk that these targets may not be achieved. Accordingly, the expenses we actually incur and the savings we actually realize may differ from our targets, particularly if actual events adversely differ from one or more of our key assumptions. The transition costs and expense savings, together with their underlying assumptions, are Forward-Looking Statements and can be affected by any of the factors discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this 10-K. We strongly caution investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or our cost and expense targets. Except as may be required by applicable securities laws, we are not under any obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any assumptions, estimates, financial goals, targets, projections or other related statements that we may make.\nAdjusted Operating Margin Target\nWe previously adopted a goal of increasing our adjusted operating margin to a target of 30% by 2020 (the 2020 Margin Target\u201d), subject to the assumptions, factors and contingencies described as part of our initial disclosure of this target. Our adjusted operating margin, which was 27.5% for 2019, increased to 30.1% for 2020, achieving our target. We do not currently expect to set a new adjusted operating margin target going forward.\nOur AUM and, therefore, our investment advisory revenues, including performance-based fee revenues, are heavily dependent on the level and volatility of the financial markets, which ended 2020 favorably. Despite the challenges faced from the COVID-19 pandemic (please refer to Impact of COVID-19\u201d above and Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A), we benefited from certain of our adjusted operating expenses declining significantly, such as costs associated with travel and entertainment and client meetings during 2020. We do not anticipate the COVID-19-related cost-savings or market tailwinds to be indicative of future performance. We also expect continued investments in growth initiatives for our firm. Considering these factors, our adjusted operating margin may be less favorable in future periods, although we will continue to strive for improvement over the long-term.\nAB Holding\nAB Holding's principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB Units. The AB Holding financial statements, notes to the financial statements and and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with those of AB.\nResults of Operations\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020-19 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019-18 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except per unit amounts) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to AB Unitholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>865,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>752,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>757,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average equity ownership interest </td> <td>35.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net income attributable to AB Unitholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>308,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>266,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes </td> <td>29,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income of AB Holding </td> <td>$ </td> <td>279,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>242,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted net income per AB Holding Unit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions per AB Holding Unit (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________\n(1)Distributions reflect the impact of AB's non-GAAP adjustments.\nAB Holding had net income of $279.4 million in 2020 compared to $238.6 million in 2019, reflecting higher net income attributable to AB Unitholders. AB Holding had net income of $238.6 million in 2019 compared to $242.4 million in 2018, reflecting lower net income attributable to AB Unitholders and lower weighted average equity ownership interest.\nAB Holding's partnership gross income is derived from its interest in AB. AB Holding's income taxes, which reflect a 3.5% federal tax on its partnership gross income from the active conduct of a trade or business, are computed by multiplying certain AB qualifying revenues (primarily U.S. investment advisory fees, brokerage commissions and direct payments for research services) by AB Holding's ownership interest in AB, multiplied by the 3.5% tax rate. AB Holding's effective tax rate was 9.4% in 2020, 10.4% in 2019 and 10.4% in 2018. See Note 6 to AB Holding's financial statements in Item 8 for a further description.\nAs supplemental information, AB provides the performance measures adjusted net revenues,\u201d adjusted operating income\u201d and adjusted operating margin,\u201d which are the principal metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing the period-to-period operating performance of AB. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of AB's operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate charges (discussed below in Adjusted Operating Income) and other adjustment items. Similarly, management believes that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in AB's results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors. Such measures are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP measures\u201d). These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in evaluating the company's financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of AB's revenues and expenses. Further, adjusted diluted net income per AB Holding Unit is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures. See Management Operating Metrics\u201d in this Item 7.\nThe impact of these adjustments on AB Holding's net income and diluted net income per AB Holding Unit are as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except per unit amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AB non-GAAP adjustments, before taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,655 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AB Income tax benefit (expense) on non-GAAP adjustments </td> <td>(523) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,473) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AB non-GAAP adjustments, after taxes </td> <td>5,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,182 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AB Holding's weighted average equity ownership interest in AB </td> <td>35.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on AB Holding's net income of AB non-GAAP adjustments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income - diluted, GAAP basis </td> <td>$ </td> <td>279,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>242,844 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on AB Holding's net income of AB non-GAAP adjustments </td> <td>2,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income - diluted </td> <td>$ </td> <td>281,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>242,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>259,700 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted net income per AB Holding Unit, GAAP basis </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of AB non-GAAP adjustments </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted diluted net income per AB Holding Unit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.67 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe degree to which AB's non-GAAP adjustments impact AB Holding's net income fluctuates based on AB Holding's ownership percentage in AB.\nTax Legislation\nFor a discussion of tax legislation, see Risk Factors - Structure-related Risks\u201d in Item 1A.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $270.0 million, compared to $222.8 million during the corresponding 2019 period. The increase primarily resulted from higher cash distributions received from AB of $49.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $222.8 million, compared to $279.3 million during the corresponding 2018 period. The decrease primarily resulted from lower cash distributions received from AB of $58.6 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million, $11.5 million and $16.6 million, respectively, reflecting investments in AB with proceeds from exercises of compensatory options to buy AB Holding Units.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $269.9 million, compared to $211.2 million during the corresponding 2019 period. The increase primarily was due to higher cash distributions to Unitholders of $48.4\nmillion and lower proceeds from exercise of compensatory options to buy AB Holding Units of $11.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $211.2 million, compared to $262.7 million during the corresponding 2018 period. The decrease primarily was due to lower cash distributions to Unitholders of $58.2 million, partially offset by lower proceeds from exercise of compensatory options to buy AB Holding Units of $5.1 million.\nManagement believes that AB Holding will have the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations as a result of the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB.\nCash Distributions\nAB Holding is required to distribute all of its Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Holding Partnership Agreement, to its Unitholders (including the General Partner). Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of units outstanding at the end of the quarter. Management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more adjustments made to adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. See Note 2 to AB Holding's financial statements in Item 8 for a description of Available Cash Flow.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nFor a discussion of commitments and contingencies, see Note 7 to AB Holding's financial statements in Item 8.\nAB\nAssets Under Management\nAssets under management by distribution channel are as follows:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

A plan of this type allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms and limitations specified in the plan. Repurchases are subject to regulations promulgated by the SEC, as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. The plan adopted during the fourth quarter of 2020 expired at the close of business on February 10, 2021. We may adopt additional plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes.\nCash Distributions\nWe are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Partnership Agreement, to our Unitholders and the General Partner. Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. In future periods, management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 for a description of Available Cash Flow.\nManagement Operating Metrics\nWe are providing the non-GAAP measures adjusted net revenues,\u201d adjusted operating income\u201d and adjusted operating margin\u201d because they are the principal operating metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing period-to-period operating performance. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of our operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate charges and other adjustment items. Similarly, we believe that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in our results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\") and non-GAAP measures in evaluating our financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of our revenues and expenses.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $115.6 million, or 14.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher investment advisory base fees of $74.1 million, higher Bernstein Research Services revenue of $51.8 million, lower promotion and servicing expenses of $33.4 million, higher performance-based fees of $33.2 million, lower amortization of intangibles of $7.4 million and lower interest on borrowings of $6.9 million, partially offset by higher employee compensation expenses (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $56.1 million, higher net investment losses of $22.8 million, lower net dividend and interest income of $8.5 million and higher general and administrative expenses of $8.2 million.\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $49.6 million, or 5.8%, from the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower performance-based fees of $99.3 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $31.5 million, higher general and administrative expenses of $29.3 million and higher employee compensation expenses (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $8.3 million, offset by higher investment advisory base fees of $95.5 million and higher investments gains and losses revenue of $22.4 million.\nOn January 1, 2018, as a result of our adoption of ASC 606, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, of $35.0 million to partners' capital in the consolidated statement of financial condition. This amount represented carried interest distributions of $77.9 million previously received, net of revenue sharing payments to investment team members, of $42.7 million, with respect to which it was probable that significant reversal would not occur. These amounts were included in adjusted net revenues and adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2018.\nAdjusted Net Revenues\nNet Revenue, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the company's distribution revenues, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory services fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on the distinct arrangements, certain distribution fees are collected by us and passed through to third-party client intermediaries, while for certain other products, we collect investment advisory services fees and a portion is passed through to third-party client intermediaries. In both arrangements, the third-party client intermediary owns the relationship with the client and is responsible for performing services and distributing the product to the client on our behalf. We believe offsetting distribution revenues and certain investment advisory services fees is useful for our investors and other users of our financial statements because such presentation appropriately reflects the nature of these costs as pass-through payments to third parties that perform functions on behalf of our sponsored mutual funds and/or shareholders of these funds. Distribution-related adjustments fluctuate each period based on the type of investment products sold, as well as the average AUM over the period. Also, we adjust distribution revenues for the amortization of deferred sales commissions as these costs, over time, will offset such revenues.\nWe adjust investment advisory and services fees and other revenues for pass through costs, primarily related to our transfer agent and shareholder servicing fees. These fees do not affect operating income, but they do affect our operating margin. As such, we exclude these fees from adjusted net revenues.\nWe adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored investment funds' revenues and including AB's fees from such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and AB's investment gains and losses on its investments in such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds that were eliminated in consolidation.\nAlso, adjusted net revenues exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we wrote-off an investment that had been received in exchange for the sale of software technology, bringing the balance to zero. Previously, we had been excluding the value of this investment from adjusted net revenues.\nLastly, adjusted net revenues include the impact of our adoption of revenue recognition standard ASC 606 during the first quarter of 2018, as discussed above.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nAdjusted operating income represents operating income on a US GAAP basis excluding (1) real estate charges (credits), (2) the impact on net revenues and compensation expense of the investment gains and losses (as well as the dividends and interest) associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (3) our CEO's EQH award compensation, as discussed below, (4) the write-down of an investment (discussed immediately above), (5) acquisition-related expenses, (6) adjustments to contingent payment arrangements, and (7) the impact of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds; provided, however, that adjusted operating income includes the revenues and expenses associated with our implementation of ASC 606 during the first quarter of 2018 discussed above.\nReal estate charges (credits) have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers. However, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, real estate charges (credits), while excluded in the period in which the charges (credits) are recorded, are included ratably over the remaining applicable lease term.\nPrior to 2009, a significant portion of employee compensation was in the form of long-term incentive compensation awards that were notionally invested in AB investment services and generally vested over a period of four years. AB economically hedged the exposure to market movements by purchasing and holding these investments on its balance sheet. All such investments had vested as of year-end 2012 and the investments have been delivered to the participants, except for those investments with respect to which the participant elected a long-term deferral. Fluctuation in the value of these investments, which also impacts compensation expense, is recorded within investment gains and losses on the income statement. Management believes it is useful to reflect the offset achieved from economically hedging the market exposure of these investments in the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The non-GAAP measures exclude gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments included in revenues and compensation expense.\nThe board of directors of EQH granted to Seth P. Bernstein ( CEO\u201d), our President and Chief Executive Officer, equity awards in connection with EQH's IPO and Mr. Bernstein's membership on the EQH Management Committee. Mr. Bernstein may receive additional equity or cash compensation from EQH in the future related to his service on the Management Committee. Any awards granted to Mr. Bernstein by EQH are recorded as compensation expense in AB's consolidated statement of income. The compensation expense associated with these awards has been excluded from our non-GAAP measures because they are non-cash and are based upon EQH's, and not AB's, financial performance.\nThe write-off of the investment discussed above in Adjusted Net Revenues has been excluded due to its non-recurring nature and because it is not part of our core operating results.\nAcquisition-related expenses have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers. During 2020, these expenses included an intangible asset impairment charge of $1.5 million relating to our 2016 acquisition.\nThe recording of changes in estimates of contingent consideration payable with respect to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions are not considered part of our core operating results and, accordingly, have been excluded.\nAdjusted net revenues include the impact of our adoption of revenue recognition standard ASC 606 during the first quarter of 2018, as discussed above.\nWe adjusted for the operating income impact of consolidating certain company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored funds' revenues and expenses and including AB's revenues and expenses that were eliminated in consolidation. We also excluded the limited partner interests we do not own.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Net Income per AB Unit\nAs previously discussed, our quarterly distribution is typically our adjusted diluted net income per unit (which is derived from adjusted net income) for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. Adjusted income taxes, used in calculating adjusted net income, are calculated using the GAAP effective tax rate adjusted for non-GAAP income tax adjustments.\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating margin allows us to monitor our financial performance and efficiency from period to period without the volatility noted above in our discussion of adjusted operating income and to compare our performance to industry peers on a basis that better reflects our performance in our core business. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenues.\nNet Revenues\nThe components of net revenues are as follows:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

fees are the largest component of our revenues. These fees generally are calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM as of a specified date, or as a percentage of the value of average AUM for the applicable billing period, and vary with the type of investment service, the size of account and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client. Accordingly, fee income generally increases or decreases as AUM increase or decrease and is affected by market appreciation or depreciation, the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts, withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts, purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares, shifts of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures, and acquisitions. Our average basis points realized (investment advisory and services fees divided by average AUM) generally approximate 30 to 110 basis points for actively-managed equity services, 10 to 75 basis points for actively-managed fixed income services and 2 to 20 basis points for passively-managed services. Average basis points realized for other services could range from 4 basis points for certain Institutional third party managed services to over 100 basis points for certain Retail and Private Wealth Management alternative services. These ranges include all-inclusive fee arrangements (covering investment management, trade execution and other services) for our Private Wealth Management clients.\nWe calculate AUM using established market-based valuation methods and fair valuation (non-observable market) methods. Market-based valuation methods include: last sale/settle prices from an exchange for actively-traded listed equities, options and futures; evaluated bid prices from recognized pricing vendors for fixed income, asset-backed or mortgage-backed issues; mid prices from recognized pricing vendors and brokers for credit default swaps; and quoted bids or spreads from pricing vendors and brokers for other derivative products. Fair valuation methods include: discounted cash flow models or any other\nmethodology that is validated and approved by our Valuation Committee (see paragraph immediately below for more information regarding our Valuation Committee). Fair valuation methods are used only where AUM cannot be valued using market-based valuation methods, such as in the case of private equity or illiquid securities.\nThe Valuation Committee, which consists of senior officers and employees, is responsible for overseeing the pricing and valuation of all investments held in client and AB portfolios. The Valuation Committee has adopted a Statement of Pricing Policies describing principles and policies that apply to pricing and valuing investments held in these portfolios. We also have a Pricing Group, which reports to the Valuation Committee and is responsible for overseeing the pricing process for all investments.\nWe sometimes charge our clients performance-based fees. In these situations, we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance-based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. Some performance-based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target (whether absolute or relative to a specified benchmark), it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance-based fees. Therefore, if we fail to achieve our performance target for a particular period, we will not earn a performance-based fee for that period and, for accounts with a high-watermark provision, our ability to earn future performance-based fees will be impaired. We are eligible to earn performance-based fees on 6.0%, 8.5% and 0.8% of the assets we manage for institutional clients, private wealth clients and retail clients, respectively (in total, 4.4% of our AUM).\nOur investment advisory and services fees increased by $123.4 million, or 5.0%, in 2020, due to a $90.4 million, or 3.8%, increase in base fees and a $33.0 million increase in performance-based fees. The increase in base fees is primarily due to an 7.9% increase in average AUM, partially offset by a lower portfolio fee rate. Our investment advisory and services fees increased by $109.8 million, or 4.6%, in 2019, due to a $128.4 million, or 5.7%, increase in base fees, which primarily resulted from a 5.5% increase in average AUM and the impact of a slight shift in product mix from fixed income to equities, which generally have higher fees. This increase was partially offset by an $18.5 million decrease in performance-based fees.\nInstitutional investment advisory and services fees increased $32.8 million, or 6.9%, in 2020, due to an increase in performance-based fees of $25.5 million and an increase in base fees of $7.3 million, or 1.6%. The increase in base fees is primarily due to an 7.7% increase in average AUM, partially offset by a lower portfolio fee rate. Institutional investment advisory and services fees increased $1.2 million, or 0.2%, in 2019, due to an increase in base fees of $6.2 million, or 1.4%, partially offset by a decrease in performance-based fees of $5.0 million. The increase in base fees was primarily due to a 2.8% increase in average AUM, partially offset by the impact of lower fee realization from active equities.\nRetail investment advisory and services fees increased $112.0 million, or 10.2%, in 2020, due to an increase in base fees of $110.1 million, or 10.2%, and a $1.9 million increase in performance-based fees. The increase in base fees is primarily due to a 11.4% increase in average AUM, partially offset by a lower portfolio fee rate. Retail investment advisory and services fees increased $88.7 million, or 8.8%, in 2019, due to an increase in base fees of $84.5 million, or 8.5%, and a $4.2 million increase in base fees. The increase in base fees was primarily due to a 10.7% increase in average AUM, partially offset by the impact of lower fee realization from active equities.\nPrivate Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees decreased by $21.4 million, or 2.4%, in 2020, due to a decrease in base fees of $27.0 million, or 3.2%, partially offset by a $5.6 million increase in performance-based fees. The decrease in base fees is primarily due to the impact of a lower portfolio fee rate, as well as a product mix shift with high fee value equity strategies now representing a lower percentage of our total AUM than in prior periods. Private Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees increased $20.0 million, or 2.3%, in 2019, due to an increase in base fees of $37.7 million, or 4.7%, partially offset by a decrease in performance-based fees of $17.7 million. The increase in base fees was primarily due to a 2.3% increase in average AUM and the impact of a shift in product mix to alternatives, which generally have higher fees.\nBernstein Research Services\nWe earn revenues for providing investment research to, and executing brokerage transactions for, institutional clients. These clients compensate us principally by directing us to execute brokerage transactions on their behalf, for which we earn commissions, and to a lesser extent, but increasingly, by paying us directly for research through commission sharing agreements or cash payments.\nRevenues from Bernstein Research Services increased $51.8 million, or 12.7%, in 2020. The increase was due to higher market volatility in 2020, particularly between March and June 2020, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to\nhigher customer activity and greater global trading volumes. We expect customer activity and trading volumes to gradually decrease in 2021 and to normalize in 2022, as the volatility surrounding COVID-19 begins to decline. Any decreases in customer activity and trading volumes will have a corresponding effect on Bernstein Research services revenue. Furthermore, all of 2020 reflects the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Autonomous (which closed on April 1, 2019).\nRevenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased $31.5 million, or 7.2%, in 2019. The decrease was due to lower global customer activity and trading commissions, partially offset by the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Autonomous (which closed on April 1, 2019).\nDistribution Revenues\nTwo of our subsidiaries act as distributors and/or placement agents of company-sponsored mutual funds and receive distribution services fees from certain of those funds as partial reimbursement of the distribution expenses they incur. Period-over-period fluctuations of distribution revenues typically are in line with fluctuations of the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds.\nDistribution revenues increased $74.7 million, or 16.4%, in 2020, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds increasing 13.2%. Distribution revenues increased $36.5 million, or 8.7%, in 2019, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds increasing 10.0%, offset by the impact of a shift in product mix from mutual funds that have higher distribution rates to mutual funds with lower distribution rates.\nDividend and Interest Income and Interest Expense\nDividend and interest income consists primarily of investment income and interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills as well as dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense principally reflects interest accrued on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts.\nDividend and interest income decreased $53.5 million, or 51.2%, in 2020, primarily due to lower interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills, as well as lower dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense decreased $41.6 million, or 72.6%, in 2020, due to lower interest paid on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts.\nDividend and interest income increased $6.2 million, or 6.3%, in 2019, primarily due to higher interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills, offset by lower dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense increased $4.8 million, or 9.2%, in 2019, due to higher interest paid on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts.\nInvestment Gains (Losses)\nInvestment gains (losses) consist primarily of realized and unrealized investment gains or losses on: (i) employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (ii) U.S. Treasury Bills, (iii) market-making in exchange-traded options and equities, (iv) seed capital investments, (v) derivatives and (vi) investments in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Investment gains (losses) also include equity in earnings of proprietary investments in limited partnership hedge funds that we sponsor and manage.\nInvestment gains (losses) are as follows:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term incentive compensation-related investments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,672 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,512 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses) </td> <td>2,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,032) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments held by consolidated company-sponsored investment funds: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Realized gains (losses) </td> <td>3,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,134) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unrealized (losses) gains </td> <td>(854) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,217 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seed capital investments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains (losses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seed capital and other </td> <td>25,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(943) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives </td> <td>(30,343) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,320) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (losses) gains </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seed capital and other </td> <td>(12,387) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,003) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives </td> <td>(5,220) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,013) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokerage-related investments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized (losses) </td> <td>(1,188) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,209) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,410) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (losses) gains </td> <td>(337) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,401) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,653 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues consist of fees earned for transfer agency services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds, fees earned for administration and recordkeeping services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds and the general accounts of EQH and its subsidiaries, and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues increased $7.1 million, or 7.3%, in 2020, primarily due to higher shareholder servicing fees, higher brokerage income and higher mutual fund reimbursements, partially offset by lower investment income related to our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Other revenues decreased $1.1 million, or 1.1%, in 2019, primarily due to lower brokerage income and lower investment income related to our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds, partially offset by higher shareholder servicing fees.\nExpenses\nThe components of expenses are as follows:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020-19 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019-18 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee compensation and benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,494,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,442,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,378,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Promotion and servicing: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution-related payments </td> <td>569,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>487,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>427,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred sales commissions </td> <td>27,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade execution, marketing, T&E and other </td> <td>189,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>786,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>722,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>671,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>485,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>484,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>448,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate charges </td> <td>5,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>491,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>488,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>456,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent payment arrangements </td> <td>1,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(510) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,219) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> <td> </td> <td>(77.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on borrowings </td> <td>6,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets </td> <td>21,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,801,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,694,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,542,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\nEmployee compensation and benefits consist of base compensation (including salaries and severance), annual short-term incentive compensation awards (cash bonuses), annual long-term incentive compensation awards, commissions, fringe benefits and other employment costs (including recruitment, training, temporary help and meals).\nCompensation expense as a percentage of net revenues was 40.3%, 41.0% and 40.9% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Compensation expense generally is determined on a discretionary basis and is primarily a function of our firm's current-year financial performance. The amounts of incentive compensation we award are designed to motivate, reward and retain top talent while aligning our executives' interests with the interests of our Unitholders. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of AllianceBernstein Corporation ( Compensation Committee\u201d), periodically confirms that the appropriate metric to consider in determining the amount of incentive compensation is the ratio of adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues. Adjusted net revenues used in the adjusted compensation ratio are the same as the adjusted net revenues presented as a non-GAAP measure (discussed earlier in this Item 7). Adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense is total employee compensation and benefits expense minus other employment costs such as recruitment, training, temporary help and meals (which were 0.9%, 1.2% and 1.1% of adjusted net revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively), and excludes the impact of mark-to-market vesting expense, as well as dividends and interest expense, associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments and the amortization expense associated with the awards issued by EQH to our firm's CEO relating to his role as a member of the EQH Management Committee. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee, has established as an objective that adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense generally should not exceed 50% of our adjusted net revenues, except in unexpected or unusual circumstances. Our ratios of adjusted compensation expense as a percentage of adjusted net revenues were 47.9%, 47.9% and 47.5%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIn 2020, employee compensation and benefits expense increased $51.4 million, or 3.6%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation of $58.8 million and higher base compensation of $13.5 million (primarily higher base salaries), offset by lower fringes of $8.5 million, lower commissions of $6.2 million and lower other employment costs of $6.2 million. In 2019, employee compensation and benefits expense increased $64.0 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to higher base compensation of $34.1 million (primarily higher salaries), higher incentive compensation of $17.4 million and higher fringes of $15.6 million, partially offset by lower commissions of $3.2 million.\nPromotion and Servicing\nPromotion and servicing expenses include distribution-related payments to financial intermediaries for distribution of AB mutual funds and amortization of deferred sales commissions paid to financial intermediaries for the sale of back-end load shares of AB mutual funds. Also included in this expense category are costs related to travel and entertainment, advertising and promotional materials.\nPromotion and servicing expenses increased $63.6 million, or 8.8%, in 2020. The increase primarily was due to higher distribution-related payments of $81.3 million, higher amortization of deferred sales commissions of $12.3 million, higher trade execution and clearance expenses of $7.9 million and higher transfer fees of $4.8 million, offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses of $34.3 million and lower marketing expenses of $8.4 million. The decrease in travel and entertainment and marketing expense is primarily a result of cost savings associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect these costs to increase in 2021 and further normalize in 2022, as the pandemic recedes. Promotion and servicing expenses increased $51.7 million, or 7.7%, in 2019. The increase primarily was due to higher distribution-related payments of $60.8 million and higher travel and entertainment expenses of $3.2 million, offset by lower amortization of deferred sales commissions of $6.3 million, lower trade execution and clearance expenses of $3.7 million and lower marketing expenses of $2.5 million.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include portfolio services expenses, technology expenses, professional fees and office-related expenses (occupancy, communications and similar expenses). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 13.2% (13.1% excluding real estate charges), 13.9% (13.8% excluding real estate charges) and 13.5% (13.3% excluding real estate charges) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $3.0 million, or 0.6%, during 2020, primarily due to higher technology fees of $4.7 million, higher charitable contributions of $3.9 million, higher portfolio service fees of $3.6 million, higher real estate charges of $2.2 million and higher other taxes of $1.6 million, partially offset by lower professional fees of $9.1 million and lower office-related expenses of $3.5 million. General and administrative expenses increased $31.9 million, or 7.0%, during 2019, primarily due to higher portfolio service fees of $11.2 million, higher technology fees of $11.0 million and higher professional fees of $7.0 million.\nContingent Payment Arrangements\nContingent payment arrangements reflect changes in estimates of contingent payment liabilities associated with acquisitions in previous periods, as well as accretion expense of these liabilities. The expense of $1.9 million for 2020 reflects accretion expense of $3.3 million, offset by the change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2016 acquisition of $1.4 million. The credit of $0.5 million for 2019 reflects the change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2016 acquisition of $3.1 million, offset by accretion expenses of $2.6 million. The credit of $2.2 million for 2018 reflects the change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2016 acquisition of $2.4 million, offset by accretion expenses of $0.2 million.\nInterest on Borrowings\nInterest expense decreased 52.6% in 2020, reflecting lower interest rates partially offset by higher weighted average borrowings. Average daily borrowings for both the EQH facility and commercial paper were $554.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 0.5% during 2020 compared to $436.9 million and 2.5% during 2019. Interest expense increased 25.8% in 2019, reflecting both higher weighted average borrowings and interest rates. Average daily borrowings for both the EQH facility and commercial paper were $436.9 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.5% during 2019 compared to $350.3 million and 2.0% for commercial paper during 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nAB, a private limited partnership, is not subject to federal or state corporate income taxes. However, AB is subject to a 4.0% New York City unincorporated business tax ( UBT\u201d). Our domestic corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income taxes, and generally are included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return. Separate state and local income tax returns also are filed. Foreign corporate subsidiaries generally are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions where they are located.\nIncome tax expense increased $3.9 million, or 9.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019. This increase is due to higher pre-tax book income, offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate in 2020 of 5.0% compared to 5.1% in 2019. The decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by a reduction of one-time discrete items.\nIncome tax expense decreased $4.1 million, or 8.9%, in 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease is due to a lower effective tax rate in 2019 of 5.1% compared to 5.6% in 2018. The decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by a more favorable mix of earnings across the AB tax filing groups and a reduction of one-time discrete items.\nNet Income (Loss) of Consolidated Entities Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income (loss) of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests primarily consists of limited partner interests owned by other investors in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2020, we had $4.2 million of net losses of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to losses on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2019 and 2018, we had $29.6 million and $21.9 million, respectively, of net gains of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to gains on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Fluctuations period-to-period result primarily from the number of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and their respective market performance.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nCash flows from operating activities primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and services fees and other revenues offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Our cash flows from operating activities have historically been positive and sufficient in supporting our operations. We do not anticipate this to change in the foreseeable future. Cash flows from investing activities generally consist of small capital expenditures and, when applicable, business acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities primarily consist of issuance and repayment of debt and the repurchase of AB Holding units to fund our long-term deferred compensation plans. We are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow to our Unitholders and the General Partner.\nDuring 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, compared to $827.5 million during 2019. The change primarily was due to net activity of our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $468.2 million, an increase in broker-dealer related payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity) of $368.0 million, a decrease in other assets of $92.3 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $67.2 million and an increase in accrued compensation of $54.4 million, partially offset by higher net purchases of broker-dealer investments of $454.1 million. During 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $827.5 million, compared to $1.3 billion during 2018. The change primarily was due to a decrease in broker-dealer related payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity) of $754.8 million and net activity of our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $427.6 million, offset by lower net purchases of broker-dealer investments of $754.7 million.\nDuring 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $59.1 million, compared to $23.0 million during 2019. The change is primarily due to $13.6 millions paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $4.1 million paid for equity method investments and higher purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements of $13.2 million. During 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $23.0 million, compared to $32.8 million during 2018. The change is primarily due to the acquisition of Autonomous, net of cash acquired, of $5.3 million.\nDuring 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion, compared to $775.0 million during 2019. The change reflects higher redemptions of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $369.1 million and higher distributions to the General Partner and Unitholders of $133.4 million, partially offset by higher net proceeds of debt of $112.9 million and an increase in overdrafts payable of $47.3 million. During 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $775.0 million, compared to $1.6 billion during 2018. The change reflects the net purchases of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in 2019 as compared to net redemptions of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in 2018 (impact of $622.2 million), lower distributions to the General Partner and Unitholders of $154.7 million and lower net purchases of AB Holding Units to fund long-term incentive compensation plan awards of $95.5 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, AB had $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash and cash equivalents of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds), all of which is available for liquidity but consist primarily of cash on deposit for our broker-dealers related to various customer clearing activities, and cash held by foreign subsidiaries of $586.3 million.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nSee Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for disclosures relating to our debt and credit facilities.\nOur financial condition and access to public and private debt markets should provide adequate liquidity for our general business needs. Management believes that cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and AB Units or AB Holding Units will provide us with the resources we need to meet our financial obligations. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Item 7 for a discussion of credit markets and our ability to renew our credit facilities at expiration.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nGuarantees\nUnder various circumstances, AB guarantees the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAB maintains guarantees in connection with the Credit Facility (the \"Credit Facility\") and Revolver (the \"Revolver\"). If SCB LLC is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand. In addition, AB maintains guarantees totaling $365.0 million for SCB LLC's three uncommitted lines of credit.\nAB maintains a guarantee with a commercial bank, under which we guarantee the obligations in the ordinary course of business of each of SCB LLC, our U.K.-based broker-dealer and our Cayman subsidiary. We also maintain three additional guarantees with other commercial banks under which we guarantee approximately $294.7 million of obligations for our U.K.-based broker-dealer and $99.0 million of obligations for our India-based broker-dealer. In the event that any of these three entities is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand.\nWe also have two smaller guarantees with a commercial bank totaling approximately $2.1 million, under which we guarantee certain obligations in the ordinary course of business of one of our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe have not been required to perform under any of the above agreements and currently have no liability in connection with these agreements.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQH credit facility </td> <td>$ </td> <td>675.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>675.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases, net of sublease commitments </td> <td>851.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>526.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding commitments </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued compensation and benefits </td> <td>309.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FIN 48 reserve </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal transition tax </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,862.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>987.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2010, as general partner of AllianceBernstein U.S. Real Estate L.P. ( Real Estate Fund\u201d), we committed to invest $25.0 million in the Real Estate Fund. As of December 31, 2020, we had funded $22.4 million of this commitment. During 2014, as general partner of AllianceBernstein U.S. Real Estate II L.P. ( Real Estate Fund II\u201d), we committed to invest $27.3 million, as amended in 2020, in the Real Estate Fund II. As of December 31, 2020, we had funded $20.8 million of this commitment.\nAccrued compensation and benefits amounts in the table above exclude our accrued pension obligation. Offsetting our accrued compensation obligations are long-term incentive compensation-related investments and money market investments we funded totaling $67.0 million, which are included in our consolidated statement of financial condition. Any amounts reflected on the\nconsolidated statement of financial condition as payables (to broker-dealers, brokerage clients and company-sponsored mutual funds) and accounts payable and accrued expenses (excluding the tax obligations above) are excluded from the table above.\nWe expect to make contributions to our qualified profit sharing plan of approximately $15 million in each of the next four years. We do not currently anticipate that we will contribute to the Retirement Plan during 2021.\nThe 2017 Tax Act (enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017) imposed a federal transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of certain deferred foreign earnings. Management elected to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight-year period from 2018 to 2025. The federal transition tax obligation is recorded to income tax payable on our consolidated statement of financial condition. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our taxes.\nDuring October 2018, we signed a lease, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020, relating to 218,976 square feet of space at our newly constructed Nashville headquarters. Our estimated total base rent obligation (excluding taxes, operating expenses and utilities) over the 15-year initial lease term is $134.0 million. During April 2019, we signed a lease, which commences in 2024, relating to approximately 190,000 square feet of newly constructed space in New York City. Our estimated total base rent obligation (excluding taxes, operating expenses and utilities) over the 20-year lease term is approximately $448.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we exercised an option to return a half floor of this space, which reduced our square footage from approximately 190,000 to 166,000 square feet and our base rent obligation from $448.0 million to $393.0 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion of our leases.\nSee Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our debt.\nContingencies\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\nManagement believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve significant management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used.\nGoodwill\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had goodwill of $3.1 billion on the consolidated statement of financial condition. We have determined that AB has only one reporting segment and reporting unit. We test our goodwill annually, as of September 30, for impairment. As of September 30, 2020, the impairment test indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The carrying value of goodwill is also reviewed if facts and circumstances occur that suggest possible impairment, such as significant declines in AUM, revenues, earnings or the price of an AB Holding Unit.\nOn an annual basis, or when circumstances warrant, goodwill is tested for impairment utilizing the market approach where the fair value of the reporting unit is based on its unadjusted market valuation (AB Units outstanding multiplied by AB Holding's Unit price) and earnings multiples. The price of a publicly-traded AB Holding Unit serves as a reasonable starting point for valuing an AB Unit because each represents the same fractional interest in our underlying business. Our market approach analysis also includes comparable industry earnings multiples applied to our earnings forecast and assumes a control premium (when applicable).\nThroughout the year, the carrying value of goodwill is also reviewed for impairment if certain events or changes in circumstances occur, and trigger whether an interim impairment test may be required. Such changes in circumstances may include, but are not limited to, a sustained decrease in the price of an AB Unit or declines in AB's market capitalization that would suggest that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount; significant and unanticipated declines in AB's assets under management or revenues; and/or lower than expected earnings per unit. Any of these changes in circumstances could suggest the possibility that goodwill is impaired, but none of these events or circumstances by itself would indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. Instead, they are merely recognized as triggering events for the consideration of impairment and must be viewed in combination with any mitigating or positive factors. A holistic evaluation of all events since the most recent quantitative impairment test must be done to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit is impaired.\nAs of January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The guidance removed Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which had required a hypothetical purchase price allocation. As a result of the revised guidance, a goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Under this guidance, the goodwill impairment test no longer includes a determination by management of whether a decline in fair value is temporary; however, it is important to consider the impact of changing market conditions, including the severity and anticipated duration, is reflected in management's determination of fair value.\nLoss Contingencies\nManagement continuously reviews with legal counsel the status of regulatory matters and pending or threatened litigation. We evaluate the likelihood that a loss contingency exists and record a loss contingency if it is both probable and reasonably estimable as of the date of the financial statements. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nCautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements provided by management in this report are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The most significant of these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: the performance of financial markets, the investment performance of sponsored investment products and separately-managed accounts, general economic conditions, industry trends, future acquisitions, integration of acquired companies, competitive conditions and government regulations, including changes in tax regulations and rates and the manner in which the earnings of publicly-traded partnerships are taxed. We caution readers to carefully consider such factors. Further, these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. For further information regarding these forward-looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ, see Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. Any or all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this Form 10-K, other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, and any other public statements we issue, may turn out to be wrong. It is important to remember that other factors besides those listed in Risk Factors\u201d and those listed below could also adversely impact our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nThe forward-looking statements referred to in the preceding paragraph, most of which directly affect AB but also affect AB Holding because AB Holding's principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB, include statements regarding:\n\u2022Our belief that the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB will provide AB Holding with the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations: AB Holding's cash flow is dependent on the quarterly cash distributions it receives from AB. Accordingly, AB Holding's ability to meet its financial obligations is dependent on AB's cash flow from its operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets and other factors beyond our control.\n\u2022Our financial condition and ability to access the public and private capital markets providing adequate liquidity for our general business needs: Our financial condition is dependent on our cash flow from operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets, our ability to maintain and grow client assets under management and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to access public and private capital markets on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, our firm's credit ratings, our profitability and changes in government regulations, including tax rates and interest rates.\n\u2022The outcome of litigation: Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive damage awards do occur. Though we have stated that we do not expect any pending legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, any settlement or judgment with respect to a legal proceeding could be significant, and could have such an effect.\n\u2022The possibility that we will engage in open market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program: The number of AB Holding Units AB may decide to buy in future periods, if any, to help fund incentive compensation awards depends on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the fluctuation in the price of an AB Holding Unit (NYSE: AB) and the availability of cash to make these purchases.\n\u2022Our determination that adjusted employee compensation expense should not exceed 50% of our adjusted net revenues: Aggregate employee compensation reflects employee performance and competitive compensation levels. Fluctuations in our revenues and/or changes in competitive compensation levels could result in adjusted employee compensation expense exceeding 50% of our adjusted net revenues.\n\u2022Our Relocation Strategy: While the expenses, expense savings and EPU impact we expect will result from our Relocation Strategy are presented with numerical specificity, and we believe these figures to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions on which our estimates are based create a significant risk that our current estimates may not be realized. These assumptions include:\n\u2022the amount and timing of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs we experience; and\n\u2022the timing for execution of each phase of our relocation implementation plan.\n\u2022The Adverse Impact of COVID-19: The severity of the expected adverse impact on our AUM and revenues of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on the depth and length of the downturn and its impact on the companies in which we invest. Our conclusions about the possible continuing significant adverse impact on us is based on our assumptions that the recovery will be gradual and that there will be lasting high unemployment and economic damage. We believe that these assumptions are reasonable, but they may not be correct and economic conditions likely will differ from our assumptions.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nImpact of COVID-19\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 significantly impacted the global economy. The impact has been profound, has continued through the fourth quarter of 2020 and is likely to persist for months to come. While many businesses have re-opened, vaccinations have begun and leading economic indicators are showing signs of improvement, the overall extent and duration of COVID-19's impact on businesses and economic activity generally remains unclear. A recession in the near term remains possible. Economic effects from COVID-19, which have impacted virtually all countries and industries, include:\n\u2022Many small and large businesses being forced to interrupt their operations and as a result, lay off employees or even close;\n\u2022The re-opening and subsequent shuttering again of certain businesses in various countries around the world;\n\u2022Temporary large-scale population lock-downs, domestic and international travel restrictions and social-distancing measures were implemented, driving sharp declines in consumer and business spending. Further, while many businesses have re-opened, some are only allowing limited capacity, imposing social distancing restrictions and providing limited hours of operation, and while consumer spending has improved during the second half of 2020, uncertainty remains;\n\u2022Schools, many of which were shuttered during the first quarter, have allowed students to return to in-person instruction, but the constant concern and uncertainty of whether an outbreak may occur, have forced many schools to re-implement remote instruction, creating significant strain and uncertainty for working parents, which may slow or reverse the economic recovery;\n\u2022Significant declines and increased volatility impacted global financial markets during the first quarter, including 23.2% and 20.0% declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( Dow\u201d) and S&P 500 Index ( S&P\u201d), respectively. Although the financial markets recovered their first quarter losses to new highs in the months since, the prospect of continued volatility remains, especially given the uncertainty surrounding the continued economic effects of the virus (please see \"Market Environment\" below for additional details).\n\u2022The initial distribution of multiple COVID-19 vaccinations was initiated in the later part of the fourth quarter, but the speed, selective nature and logistical challenges of distribution, and the concerns in some communities around the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, have caused turmoil for many, further heightening the anxiety around the virus.\nGovernments around the world have responded to COVID-19 with economic stimulus measures, including a $2 trillion emergency relief bill passed in the U.S during the first quarter of 2020 and an additional $900 billion in aid passed during the fourth quarter of 2020. Similar fiscal stimulus was passed by many governments around the world. These measures and possible additional stimulus and aid measures are intended to steady businesses and consumers until economic activity meaningfully recovers. The timing and magnitude of any such recovery, however, remains uncertain.\nVarious countries around the world have continued to experience surges in the rates of COVID-19 infections, which are likely the result of greatly increased social interactions, including at colleges and universities, after re-opening of economies, as well as more contagious strains of the virus. As a result, several countries have paused the continued progression of their re-openings or re-imposed closing mandates on certain businesses, such as bars, restaurants and entertainment venues. These circumstances may adversely affect consumer sentiment and the pace of business re-openings, and they also may delay any economic recovery.\nAB Impact\nAt the initial onset of COVID-19 during the first quarter of 2020, we quickly responded in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the U.S., the U.K., Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore and Taiwan. We implemented business continuity measures, including travel restrictions and a work-from-home requirement for almost all personnel (other than a relatively small number of employees whose physical presence in our offices was considered critical), which has remained in place (except in our Asia offices, most of which have reopened) throughout the second, third and fourth quarters, to ensure operating continuity for all critical functions. We also instituted a notification process for any employee who tests positive for COVID-19 or has been exposed to someone else who has tested positive. As the COVID-19 crisis has continued to evolve since the lockdown in the first quarter, certain key functions of the business, such as Risk Management, Business Continuity, Finance and Human Capital, have maintained constant communication and monitored the evolution of the pandemic to keep our employees safe and advise of key developments. Additionally, we continue to monitor communications from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure we have current information.\nWe have continued to enhance our technology, which has increased the effectiveness of our remote work force. We have also continued to enhance our virtual programs to support business functions, such as training on cybersecurity and enhancements to our existing technology platforms. There has been a heightened focus on the emotional well-being of our employees, and we have provided regular touch points with employees through virtual town halls and management communications. Additionally, we have maintained regular communications and updates on the virus and the Company's response, which are posted on the Company's internal website, to ensure transparent communication with our employees. If any of our employees test positive for COVID-19 or interact with someone who has the virus, they are required to contact AB immediately for support and contact-tracing.\nWe continue to consider, and in some cases methodically implement, return to office programs for our U.S., European and Asia offices. However, we continue to monitor the daily evolution of the crisis in order to ensure the health and safety of our employees remains our top priority. We will modify our return to office plans, as needed, to ensure the safety of our employees and to ensure that the highest safety and cleanliness protocols are followed. We believe that our business continuity plan and technology platform will continue to support the effectiveness of our employees working remotely.\nAsset managers, such as AB, rely heavily on the performance of the financial markets largely to determine assets under management ( AUM\u201d) and revenues. Our results during the first quarter of 2020 were strong, which was primarily a reflection of financial market conditions during January and February, which were not adversely affected by COVID-19. Market conditions deteriorated dramatically during March, which negatively impacted our performance in that month. Financial markets, and hence our performance, rebounded during the ensuing months, primarily due to a U.S. Federal Government stimulus package and U.S. Treasury programs, which were instituted during March 2020 and throughout the second quarter. These programs renewed confidence in the financial markets by introducing liquidity through government purchasing of financial instruments. As various states and countries around the world eased restrictions on business and lockdown protocols during the second quarter and increasingly throughout the third and fourth quarters, increases in consumer spending, decreases in the unemployment rate and improvement in other leading economic indicators have stimulated domestic and global financial market performance. As a result of these developments, our AUM has increased in the second, third and fourth quarters. However, as U.S. states and countries globally have continued to ease restrictions, there has been a resurgence in the spread of the virus, causing certain states and countries to, among other things, shutter some businesses again or impose new social distancing restrictions. As a result, market volatility continues.\nThe economic impact of COVID-19 and any additional declines in the financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our AUM and revenues, particularly if economic activity does not continue to recover. Although countries throughout the world continue to grapple with re-opening their economies, this will continue to be a gradual process, and there is a significant risk that the opening process may be further interrupted if infection rates increase. Also, although unemployment rates have declined, they are still considered high and any reluctance of consumers to resume spending will do long-term damage to the global economy, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, as most of our workforce is working remotely, we are mindful of increased risk related to cybersecurity, which could significantly disrupt our business functions.\nUltimately, the return to normal business and economic activity will likely require the broad application of effective vaccines. Although the distribution of multiple vaccines was initiated towards the end of the fourth quarter, the speed, selective nature of those who are eligible to receive the vaccination, as well as logistical challenges regarding availability and distribution of the vaccines, could mean many months until the general population has been vaccinated.\nExecutive Overview\nPercentage change figures are calculated using assets under management rounded to the nearest million and financial statement amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.\nOur total assets under management (\"AUM\") as of December 31, 2020 were $685.9 billion, up $63.0 billion, or 10.1%, during 2020. The increase was driven primarily by market appreciation of $65.4 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $2.6 billion (due to Private Wealth Management net outflows of $2.0 billion and Retail net outflows of $1.6 billion, offset by Institutional net inflows of $1.0 billion). Excluding AXA's redemption of low-fee fixed income mandates of $11.8 billion, the firm generated net inflows of $9.2 billion in 2020.\nInstitutional AUM increased $32.9 billion, or 11.6%, to $315.6 billion during 2020, primarily due to market appreciation of $30.5 billion and net inflows of $1.0 billion. Gross sales increased $13.8 billion, from $17.1 billion in 2019 to $30.9 billion in 2020. Redemptions and terminations increased $11.3 billion, from $12.0 billion in 2019 to $23.3 billion in 2020. Excluding AXA's redemption of low-fee fixed income mandates of $11.8 billion, institutional net inflows were $12.8 billion in 2020.\nRetail AUM increased $26.1 billion, or 10.9%, to $265.3 billion during 2020, primarily due to market appreciation of $28.1 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $1.6 billion. Gross sales increased $3.6 billion, from $75.3 billion in 2019 to $78.9\nbillion in 2020. Redemptions and terminations increased $25.5 billion, from $44.0 billion in 2019 to $69.5 billion in 2020, due to record first quarter 2020 redemptions, reflecting the financial market sell-off in March amidst the onset of COVID-19.\nPrivate Wealth Management AUM increased $4.0 billion, or 3.9%, to $105.0 billion during 2020, primarily due to market appreciation of $6.8 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $2.0 billion. Gross sales increased $3.0 billion, from $11.3 billion in 2019 to $14.3 billion in 2020. Redemptions and terminations increased $4.1 billion, from $12.4 billion in 2019 to $16.5 billion in 2020.\nBernstein Research Services revenue increased $51.8 million, or 12.7%, in 2020. The increase was due to higher market volatility, particularly between March and June 2020, primarily as a result of COVID-19, which led to higher customer activity and greater global trading volumes. We expect customer activity and trading volumes to gradually decrease in 2021 and to normalize in 2022, as the volatility surrounding COVID-19 begins to decline. Any decreases in customer activity and trading volumes will have a corresponding effect on Bernstein Research services revenue. Furthermore, all of 2020 reflects the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Autonomous Research (\"Autonomous\"), which closed on April 1, 2019.\nOur 2020 net revenues of $3.7 billion increased $190.1 million, or 5.4%, compared to the prior year's net revenues. The most significant contributors to the increase were higher base advisory fees of $90.4 million, higher distribution revenues of $74.7 million, higher Bernstein Research Services revenue of $51.8 million and higher performance-based fees of $33.0 million, partially offset by higher investment losses of $55.1 million and lower net dividend and interest income of $11.9 million. Our operating expenses of $2.8 billion increased $106.1 million, or 3.9%, compared to the prior year's expenses. The increase primarily was due to higher promotion and servicing expenses of $63.6 million, higher employee compensation and benefits of $51.4 million and higher general and administrative expenses (including real estate charges) of $3.0 million, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets of $7.4 million and lower interest on borrowings of $6.9 million. Our operating income increased $84.0 million, or 10.2%, to $907.4 million from $823.4 million in 2019 and our operating margin increased from 22.6% in 2019 to 24.6% in 2020.\nMarket Environment\nDespite 2020 being a year marked by a global pandemic, record-breaking recession and unemployment levels, and a contentious U.S. presidential election, equity markets closed the year with solid gains. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq each rallied for most of the fourth quarter, finishing the year in positive territory. In the U.S., the presidential election passed with a market-friendly outcome, the distribution of multiple COVID-19 vaccines was initiated and the unemployment rate continued to decline. Meanwhile, after months of deadlock, a COVID-19 relief package was passed in the fourth quarter, consisting of direct payments, unemployment benefits and small business aid. However, even with the increasing likelihood of COVID-19 vaccines potentially boosting activity in 2021, significant slack in the economy and labor market by the end of this year are likely. As a result, the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely keep interest rates near zero as the economy improves.\nIn the U.K., COVID-19 and Brexit uncertainty resulted in the worst performing year for its equity market since the 2008 financial crisis. However, with a Brexit deal reached in the final days of 2020 between the U.K. and the E.U. and the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine, the U.K. economy may rebound in 2021. The Bank of England is likely to keep rates on hold during the recovery phase. In China, the economy has returned to almost pre-pandemic output levels. Chinese efforts to re-center the economy on a consumer-led model are expected to continue and fiscal policy will likely remain supportive through 2021. More stimulus may be announced in the first quarter of 2021 as the government continues to support consumption. While the economic outlook for China in 2021 appears positive, one big unknown is the future of the relationship between China and the new U.S. administration.\nMiFID II\nIn Europe, MiFID II, which became effective on January 3, 2018, has made significant modifications to the manner in which European broker-dealers can be compensated for research. These modifications are believed to have significantly reduced the overall research spend by European buy-side firms, which has decreased the revenues we derive from our European clients. Our European clients may continue to reduce their research budgets, which could result in a significant decline in our sell-side revenues.\nAlso, while MiFID II is not applicable to firms operating outside of Europe, competitive and client pressures may force buy-side firms operating outside of Europe to pay for research from their own resources instead of through bundled trading commissions. If that occurs, we would expect that research budgets from those clients will decrease further, which could result in an additional significant decline in our sell-side revenues. Additionally, these competitive and client pressures may result in our buy-side operation paying for research out of our own resources instead of through bundled trading commissions, which could increase our firm's expenses and decrease our operating income.\nThe ultimate impact of MiFID II on payments for research globally remains uncertain.\nEquitable Holdings IPO\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, AXA S.A. (\"AXA\") completed the sale of a minority stake in Equitable Holdings, Inc. ( EQH\u201d) through an initial public offering (\"IPO\"). Since then, AXA has completed additional offerings and taken other steps, most recently during the fourth quarter of 2019. As a result, AXA owned less than 10% of the outstanding common stock of EQH as of December 31, 2020.\nWhile we cannot at this time predict the full impact on AB of this transaction, such impact has included a reduction in the support AXA provided to AB in the past with respect to AB's investment management business, resulting in a modest decrease in our revenues and ability to initiate new investment services. Also, AB relies on AXA, including its subsidiary, AXA Business Services, for several significant services and AB has benefited from its affiliation with AXA in certain common vendor relationships. Some of these arrangements have changed, and others are expected to change, with immaterial financial implications for AB.\nOur ending AUM at December 31, 2020 reflects $11.8 billion in 2020 outflows resulting from AXA's redemption of certain low-fee fixed income mandates. We expect these redemptions to total approximately $14 billion, with the remaining redemptions expected to be completed during the first half of 2021. The revenue we earn from the management of these assets is not significant.\nRelocation Strategy\nOn May 2, 2018, we announced that we would establish our corporate headquarters in, and relocate approximately 1,050 jobs located in the New York metro area to, Nashville, TN. Subsequently, on January 14, 2020, we announced our plans to relocate an additional 200 jobs to Nashville thereby increasing the total relocated jobs to 1,250. The decision to add the additional jobs was the result of the growth in our business, select investments we are making, and the in-sourcing of roles typically performed by consultants. Our Nashville headquarters will house Finance, IT, Operations, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, Human Capital, and Sales and Marketing. We have been actively relocating jobs and expect this transition to take several years. We will continue to maintain a principal location in New York City, which will house our Portfolio Management, Sell-Side Research and Trading, and New York-based Private Wealth Management businesses.\nWe believe relocating our corporate headquarters to Nashville will afford us the opportunity to provide an improved quality of life alternative for our employees and enable us to attract and recruit new talented employees to a highly desirable location while improving the long-term cost structure of the firm.\nDuring the transition period, which began in 2018 and is expected to continue through 2024, we currently estimate we will incur transition costs of approximately $145 million to $155 million, which is less than our previous estimate of $155 million to $165 million. These costs include employee relocation, severance, recruitment, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. Over this same period, we expect to realize total expense savings of approximately $205 million to $215 million, which is greater than our previous estimate of $185 million to $195 million, and is an amount greater than the total transition costs. However, we did incur some transition costs before we began to realize expense savings. For the period beginning in 2018 and ending in 2020, we incurred $70 million of cumulative transition costs compared to $46 million of cumulative savings. In 2020, expense savings of $30 million were greater than transition costs of $26 million, resulting in a net increase of $0.01 in net income per unit ( EPU\u201d). We currently anticipate an EPU increase in 2021 of approximately $0.02 and expect to achieve increasing EPU accretion in each year thereafter. Beginning in 2025, once the transition period has been completed, we estimate ongoing annual expense savings towards the upper end of the range of $75 million to $80 million, which will result from a combination of occupancy and compensation-related savings. Our estimates for both the transition costs and the corresponding expense savings are based upon our current assumptions of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. In addition, our estimates for both the timing of when we incur transition costs and realize the related expense savings are based on our current relocation implementation plan and the timing for execution of each phase. The actual total charges we eventually record, the related expense savings we realize, and timing of EPU impact may differ from our current estimates as we implement each phase of our headquarters relocation.\nDuring October 2018, we signed a lease, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020, relating to 218,976 square feet of space at our new Nashville headquarters. Our estimated total base rent obligation (excluding taxes, operating expenses and utilities) over the 15-year initial lease term is $134 million.\nAlthough we have presented our transition costs and annual expense savings with numerical specificity, and we believe these targets to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions we discuss above create a significant risk that these targets may not be achieved. Accordingly, the expenses we actually incur and the savings we actually realize may differ from our targets, particularly if actual events adversely differ from one or more of our key assumptions. The transition costs and expense savings, together with their underlying assumptions, are Forward-Looking Statements and can be affected by any of the factors discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this 10-K. We strongly caution investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or our cost and expense targets. Except as may be required by applicable securities laws, we are not under any obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any assumptions, estimates, financial goals, targets, projections or other related statements that we may make.\nAdjusted Operating Margin Target\nWe previously adopted a goal of increasing our adjusted operating margin to a target of 30% by 2020 (the 2020 Margin Target\u201d), subject to the assumptions, factors and contingencies described as part of our initial disclosure of this target. Our adjusted operating margin, which was 27.5% for 2019, increased to 30.1% for 2020, achieving our target. We do not currently expect to set a new adjusted operating margin target going forward.\nOur AUM and, therefore, our investment advisory revenues, including performance-based fee revenues, are heavily dependent on the level and volatility of the financial markets, which ended 2020 favorably. Despite the challenges faced from the COVID-19 pandemic (please refer to Impact of COVID-19\u201d above and Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A), we benefited from certain of our adjusted operating expenses declining significantly, such as costs associated with travel and entertainment and client meetings during 2020. We do not anticipate the COVID-19-related cost-savings or market tailwinds to be indicative of future performance. We also expect continued investments in growth initiatives for our firm. Considering these factors, our adjusted operating margin may be less favorable in future periods, although we will continue to strive for improvement over the long-term.\nAB Holding\nAB Holding's principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB Units. The AB Holding financial statements, notes to the financial statements and and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with those of AB.\nResults of Operations\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020-19 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019-18 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except per unit amounts) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to AB Unitholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>865,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>752,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>757,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average equity ownership interest </td> <td>35.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net income attributable to AB Unitholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>308,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>266,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes </td> <td>29,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income of AB Holding </td> <td>$ </td> <td>279,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>242,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted net income per AB Holding Unit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions per AB Holding Unit (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________\n(1)Distributions reflect the impact of AB's non-GAAP adjustments.\nAB Holding had net income of $279.4 million in 2020 compared to $238.6 million in 2019, reflecting higher net income attributable to AB Unitholders. AB Holding had net income of $238.6 million in 2019 compared to $242.4 million in 2018, reflecting lower net income attributable to AB Unitholders and lower weighted average equity ownership interest.\nAB Holding's partnership gross income is derived from its interest in AB. AB Holding's income taxes, which reflect a 3.5% federal tax on its partnership gross income from the active conduct of a trade or business, are computed by multiplying certain AB qualifying revenues (primarily U.S. investment advisory fees, brokerage commissions and direct payments for research services) by AB Holding's ownership interest in AB, multiplied by the 3.5% tax rate. AB Holding's effective tax rate was 9.4% in 2020, 10.4% in 2019 and 10.4% in 2018. See Note 6 to AB Holding's financial statements in Item 8 for a further description.\nAs supplemental information, AB provides the performance measures adjusted net revenues,\u201d adjusted operating income\u201d and adjusted operating margin,\u201d which are the principal metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing the period-to-period operating performance of AB. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of AB's operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate charges (discussed below in Adjusted Operating Income) and other adjustment items. Similarly, management believes that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in AB's results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors. Such measures are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP measures\u201d). These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in evaluating the company's financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of AB's revenues and expenses. Further, adjusted diluted net income per AB Holding Unit is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures. See Management Operating Metrics\u201d in this Item 7.\nThe impact of these adjustments on AB Holding's net income and diluted net income per AB Holding Unit are as follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except per unit amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AB non-GAAP adjustments, before taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,655 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AB Income tax benefit (expense) on non-GAAP adjustments </td> <td>(523) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,473) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AB non-GAAP adjustments, after taxes </td> <td>5,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,182 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AB Holding's weighted average equity ownership interest in AB </td> <td>35.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on AB Holding's net income of AB non-GAAP adjustments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income - diluted, GAAP basis </td> <td>$ </td> <td>279,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>242,844 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on AB Holding's net income of AB non-GAAP adjustments </td> <td>2,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income - diluted </td> <td>$ </td> <td>281,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>242,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>259,700 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted net income per AB Holding Unit, GAAP basis </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of AB non-GAAP adjustments </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted diluted net income per AB Holding Unit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.67 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe degree to which AB's non-GAAP adjustments impact AB Holding's net income fluctuates based on AB Holding's ownership percentage in AB.\nTax Legislation\nFor a discussion of tax legislation, see Risk Factors - Structure-related Risks\u201d in Item 1A.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $270.0 million, compared to $222.8 million during the corresponding 2019 period. The increase primarily resulted from higher cash distributions received from AB of $49.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $222.8 million, compared to $279.3 million during the corresponding 2018 period. The decrease primarily resulted from lower cash distributions received from AB of $58.6 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million, $11.5 million and $16.6 million, respectively, reflecting investments in AB with proceeds from exercises of compensatory options to buy AB Holding Units.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $269.9 million, compared to $211.2 million during the corresponding 2019 period. The increase primarily was due to higher cash distributions to Unitholders of $48.4\nmillion and lower proceeds from exercise of compensatory options to buy AB Holding Units of $11.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $211.2 million, compared to $262.7 million during the corresponding 2018 period. The decrease primarily was due to lower cash distributions to Unitholders of $58.2 million, partially offset by lower proceeds from exercise of compensatory options to buy AB Holding Units of $5.1 million.\nManagement believes that AB Holding will have the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations as a result of the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB.\nCash Distributions\nAB Holding is required to distribute all of its Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Holding Partnership Agreement, to its Unitholders (including the General Partner). Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of units outstanding at the end of the quarter. Management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more adjustments made to adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. See Note 2 to AB Holding's financial statements in Item 8 for a description of Available Cash Flow.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nFor a discussion of commitments and contingencies, see Note 7 to AB

A plan of this type allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms and limitations specified in the plan. Repurchases are subject to regulations promulgated by the SEC, as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. The plan adopted during the fourth quarter of 2020 expired at the close of business on February 10, 2021. We may adopt additional plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes.\nCash Distributions\nWe are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Partnership Agreement, to our Unitholders and the General Partner. Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. In future periods, management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 for a description of Available Cash Flow.\nManagement Operating Metrics\nWe are providing the non-GAAP measures adjusted net revenues,\u201d adjusted operating income\u201d and adjusted operating margin\u201d because they are the principal operating metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing period-to-period operating performance. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of our operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate charges and other adjustment items. Similarly, we believe that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in our results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\") and non-GAAP measures in evaluating our financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of our revenues and expenses.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $115.6 million, or 14.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher investment advisory base fees of $74.1 million, higher Bernstein Research Services revenue of $51.8 million, lower promotion and servicing expenses of $33.4 million, higher performance-based fees of $33.2 million, lower amortization of intangibles of $7.4 million and lower interest on borrowings of $6.9 million, partially offset by higher employee compensation expenses (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $56.1 million, higher net investment losses of $22.8 million, lower net dividend and interest income of $8.5 million and higher general and administrative expenses of $8.2 million.\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $49.6 million, or 5.8%, from the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower performance-based fees of $99.3 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $31.5 million, higher general and administrative expenses of $29.3 million and higher employee compensation expenses (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $8.3 million, offset by higher investment advisory base fees of $95.5 million and higher investments gains and losses revenue of $22.4 million.\nOn January 1, 2018, as a result of our adoption of ASC 606, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, of $35.0 million to partners' capital in the consolidated statement of financial condition. This amount represented carried interest distributions of $77.9 million previously received, net of revenue sharing payments to investment team members, of $42.7 million, with respect to which it was probable that significant reversal would not occur. These amounts were included in adjusted net revenues and adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2018.\nAdjusted Net Revenues\nNet Revenue, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the company's distribution revenues, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory services fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on the distinct arrangements, certain distribution fees are collected by us and passed through to third-party client intermediaries, while for certain other products, we collect investment advisory services fees and a portion is passed through to third-party client intermediaries. In both arrangements, the third-party client intermediary owns the relationship with the client and is responsible for performing services and distributing the product to the client on our behalf. We believe offsetting distribution revenues and certain investment advisory services fees is useful for our investors and other users of our financial statements because such presentation appropriately reflects the nature of these costs as pass-through payments to third parties that perform functions on behalf of our sponsored mutual funds and/or shareholders of these funds. Distribution-related adjustments fluctuate each period based on the type of investment products sold, as well as the average AUM over the period. Also, we adjust distribution revenues for the amortization of deferred sales commissions as these costs, over time, will offset such revenues.\nWe adjust investment advisory and services fees and other revenues for pass through costs, primarily related to our transfer agent and shareholder servicing fees. These fees do not affect operating income, but they do affect our operating margin. As such, we exclude these fees from adjusted net revenues.\nWe adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored investment funds' revenues and including AB's fees from such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and AB's investment gains and losses on its investments in such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds that were eliminated in consolidation.\nAlso, adjusted net revenues exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we wrote-off an investment that had been received in exchange for the sale of software technology, bringing the balance to zero. Previously, we had been excluding the value of this investment from adjusted net revenues.\nLastly, adjusted net revenues include the impact of our adoption of revenue recognition standard ASC 606 during the first quarter of 2018, as discussed above.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nAdjusted operating income represents operating income on a US GAAP basis excluding (1) real estate charges (credits), (2) the impact on net revenues and compensation expense of the investment gains and losses (as well as the dividends and interest) associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (3) our CEO's EQH award compensation, as discussed below, (4) the write-down of an investment (discussed immediately above), (5) acquisition-related expenses, (6) adjustments to contingent payment arrangements, and (7) the impact of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds; provided, however, that adjusted operating income includes the revenues and expenses associated with our implementation of ASC 606 during the first quarter of 2018 discussed above.\nReal estate charges (credits) have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers. However, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, real estate charges (credits), while excluded in the period in which the charges (credits) are recorded, are included ratably over the remaining applicable lease term.\nPrior to 2009, a significant portion of employee compensation was in the form of long-term incentive compensation awards that were notionally invested in AB investment services and generally vested over a period of four years. AB economically hedged the exposure to market movements by purchasing and holding these investments on its balance sheet. All such investments had vested as of year-end 2012 and the investments have been delivered to the participants, except for those investments with respect to which the participant elected a long-term deferral. Fluctuation in the value of these investments, which also impacts compensation expense, is recorded within investment gains and losses on the income statement. Management believes it is useful to reflect the offset achieved from economically hedging the market exposure of these investments in the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The non-GAAP measures exclude gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments included in revenues and compensation expense.\nThe board of directors of EQH granted to Seth P. Bernstein ( CEO\u201d), our President and Chief Executive Officer, equity awards in connection with EQH's IPO and Mr. Bernstein's membership on the EQH Management Committee. Mr. Bernstein may receive additional equity or cash compensation from EQH in the future related to his service on the Management Committee. Any awards granted to Mr. Bernstein by EQH are recorded as compensation expense in AB's consolidated statement of income. The compensation expense associated with these awards has been excluded from our non-GAAP measures because they are non-cash and are based upon EQH's, and not AB's, financial performance.\nThe write-off of the investment discussed above in Adjusted Net Revenues has been excluded due to its non-recurring nature and because it is not part of our core operating results.\nAcquisition-related expenses have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers. During 2020, these expenses included an intangible asset impairment charge of $1.5 million relating to our 2016 acquisition.\nThe recording of changes in estimates of contingent consideration payable with respect to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions are not considered part of our core operating results and, accordingly, have been excluded.\nAdjusted net revenues include the impact of our adoption of revenue recognition standard ASC 606 during the first quarter of 2018, as discussed above.\nWe adjusted for the operating income impact of consolidating certain company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored funds' revenues and expenses and including AB's revenues and expenses that were eliminated in consolidation. We also excluded the limited partner interests we do not own.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Net Income per AB Unit\nAs previously discussed, our quarterly distribution is typically our adjusted diluted net income per unit (which is derived from adjusted net income) for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. Adjusted income taxes, used in calculating adjusted net income, are calculated using the GAAP effective tax rate adjusted for non-GAAP income tax adjustments.\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating margin allows us to monitor our financial performance and efficiency from period to period without the volatility noted above in our discussion of adjusted operating income and to compare our performance to industry peers on a basis that better reflects our performance in our core business. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenues.\nNet Revenues\nThe components of net revenues are as follows:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

fees are the largest component of our revenues. These fees generally are calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM as of a specified date, or as a percentage of the value of average AUM for the applicable billing period, and vary with the type of investment service, the size of account and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client. Accordingly, fee income generally increases or decreases as AUM increase or decrease and is affected by market appreciation or depreciation, the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts, withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts, purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares, shifts of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures, and acquisitions. Our average basis points realized (investment advisory and services fees divided by average AUM) generally approximate 30 to 110 basis points for actively-managed equity services, 10 to 75 basis points for actively-managed fixed income services and 2 to 20 basis points for passively-managed services. Average basis points realized for other services could range from 4 basis points for certain Institutional third party managed services to over 100 basis points for certain Retail and Private Wealth Management alternative services. These ranges include all-inclusive fee arrangements (covering investment management, trade execution and other services) for our Private Wealth Management clients.\nWe calculate AUM using established market-based valuation methods and fair valuation (non-observable market) methods. Market-based valuation methods include: last sale/settle prices from an exchange for actively-traded listed equities, options and futures; evaluated bid prices from recognized pricing vendors for fixed income, asset-backed or mortgage-backed issues; mid prices from recognized pricing vendors and brokers for credit default swaps; and quoted bids or spreads from pricing vendors and brokers for other derivative products. Fair valuation methods include: discounted cash flow models or any other\nmethodology that is validated and approved by our Valuation Committee (see paragraph immediately below for more information regarding our Valuation Committee). Fair valuation methods are used only where AUM cannot be valued using market-based valuation methods, such as in the case of private equity or illiquid securities.\nThe Valuation Committee, which consists of senior officers and employees, is responsible for overseeing the pricing and valuation of all investments held in client and AB portfolios. The Valuation Committee has adopted a Statement of Pricing Policies describing principles and policies that apply to pricing and valuing investments held in these portfolios. We also have a Pricing Group, which reports to the Valuation Committee and is responsible for overseeing the pricing process for all investments.\nWe sometimes charge our clients performance-based fees. In these situations, we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance-based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. Some performance-based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target (whether absolute or relative to a specified benchmark), it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance-based fees. Therefore, if we fail to achieve our performance target for a particular period, we will not earn a performance-based fee for that period and, for accounts with a high-watermark provision, our ability to earn future performance-based fees will be impaired. We are eligible to earn performance-based fees on 6.0%, 8.5% and 0.8% of the assets we manage for institutional clients, private wealth clients and retail clients, respectively (in total, 4.4% of our AUM).\nOur investment advisory and services fees increased by $123.4 million, or 5.0%, in 2020, due to a $90.4 million, or 3.8%, increase in base fees and a $33.0 million increase in performance-based fees. The increase in base fees is primarily due to an 7.9% increase in average AUM, partially offset by a lower portfolio fee rate. Our investment advisory and services fees increased by $109.8 million, or 4.6%, in 2019, due to a $128.4 million, or 5.7%, increase in base fees, which primarily resulted from a 5.5% increase in average AUM and the impact of a slight shift in product mix from fixed income to equities, which generally have higher fees. This increase was partially offset by an $18.5 million decrease in performance-based fees.\nInstitutional investment advisory and services fees increased $32.8 million, or 6.9%, in 2020, due to an increase in performance-based fees of $25.5 million and an increase in base fees of $7.3 million, or 1.6%. The increase in base fees is primarily due to an 7.7% increase in average AUM, partially offset by a lower portfolio fee rate. Institutional investment advisory and services fees increased $1.2 million, or 0.2%, in 2019, due to an increase in base fees of $6.2 million, or 1.4%, partially offset by a decrease in performance-based fees of $5.0 million. The increase in base fees was primarily due to a 2.8% increase in average AUM, partially offset by the impact of lower fee realization from active equities.\nRetail investment advisory and services fees increased $112.0 million, or 10.2%, in 2020, due to an increase in base fees of $110.1 million, or 10.2%, and a $1.9 million increase in performance-based fees. The increase in base fees is primarily due to a 11.4% increase in average AUM, partially offset by a lower portfolio fee rate. Retail investment advisory and services fees increased $88.7 million, or 8.8%, in 2019, due to an increase in base fees of $84.5 million, or 8.5%, and a $4.2 million increase in base fees. The increase in base fees was primarily due to a 10.7% increase in average AUM, partially offset by the impact of lower fee realization from active equities.\nPrivate Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees decreased by $21.4 million, or 2.4%, in 2020, due to a decrease in base fees of $27.0 million, or 3.2%, partially offset by a $5.6 million increase in performance-based fees. The decrease in base fees is primarily due to the impact of a lower portfolio fee rate, as well as a product mix shift with high fee value equity strategies now representing a lower percentage of our total AUM than in prior periods. Private Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees increased $20.0 million, or 2.3%, in 2019, due to an increase in base fees of $37.7 million, or 4.7%, partially offset by a decrease in performance-based fees of $17.7 million. The increase in base fees was primarily due to a 2.3% increase in average AUM and the impact of a shift in product mix to alternatives, which generally have higher fees.\nBernstein Research Services\nWe earn revenues for providing investment research to, and executing brokerage transactions for, institutional clients. These clients compensate us principally by directing us to execute brokerage transactions on their behalf, for which we earn commissions, and to a lesser extent, but increasingly, by paying us directly for research through commission sharing agreements or cash payments.\nRevenues from Bernstein Research Services increased $51.8 million, or 12.7%, in 2020. The increase was due to higher market volatility in 2020, particularly between March and June 2020, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to\nhigher customer activity and greater global trading volumes. We expect customer activity and trading volumes to gradually decrease in 2021 and to normalize in 2022, as the volatility surrounding COVID-19 begins to decline. Any decreases in customer activity and trading volumes will have a corresponding effect on Bernstein Research services revenue. Furthermore, all of 2020 reflects the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Autonomous (which closed on April 1, 2019).\nRevenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased $31.5 million, or 7.2%, in 2019. The decrease was due to lower global customer activity and trading commissions, partially offset by the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Autonomous (which closed on April 1, 2019).\nDistribution Revenues\nTwo of our subsidiaries act as distributors and/or placement agents of company-sponsored mutual funds and receive distribution services fees from certain of those funds as partial reimbursement of the distribution expenses they incur. Period-over-period fluctuations of distribution revenues typically are in line with fluctuations of the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds.\nDistribution revenues increased $74.7 million, or 16.4%, in 2020, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds increasing 13.2%. Distribution revenues increased $36.5 million, or 8.7%, in 2019, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds increasing 10.0%, offset by the impact of a shift in product mix from mutual funds that have higher distribution rates to mutual funds with lower distribution rates.\nDividend and Interest Income and Interest Expense\nDividend and interest income consists primarily of investment income and interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills as well as dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense principally reflects interest accrued on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts.\nDividend and interest income decreased $53.5 million, or 51.2%, in 2020, primarily due to lower interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills, as well as lower dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense decreased $41.6 million, or 72.6%, in 2020, due to lower interest paid on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts.\nDividend and interest income increased $6.2 million, or 6.3%, in 2019, primarily due to higher interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills, offset by lower dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense increased $4.8 million, or 9.2%, in 2019, due to higher interest paid on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts.\nInvestment Gains (Losses)\nInvestment gains (losses) consist primarily of realized and unrealized investment gains or losses on: (i) employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (ii) U.S. Treasury Bills, (iii) market-making in exchange-traded options and equities, (iv) seed capital investments, (v) derivatives and (vi) investments in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Investment gains (losses) also include equity in earnings of proprietary investments in limited partnership hedge funds that we sponsor and manage.\nInvestment gains (losses) are as follows:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term incentive compensation-related investments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,672 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,512 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gains (losses) </td> <td>2,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,032) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments held by consolidated company-sponsored investment funds: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Realized gains (losses) </td> <td>3,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,134) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unrealized (losses) gains </td> <td>(854) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,217 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seed capital investments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains (losses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seed capital and other </td> <td>25,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(943) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives </td> <td>(30,343) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,320) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (losses) gains </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seed capital and other </td> <td>(12,387) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,003) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives </td> <td>(5,220) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,013) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,384 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokerage-related investments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized (losses) </td> <td>(1,188) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,209) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,410) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (losses) gains </td> <td>(337) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,401) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,653 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues consist of fees earned for transfer agency services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds, fees earned for administration and recordkeeping services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds and the general accounts of EQH and its subsidiaries, and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues increased $7.1 million, or 7.3%, in 2020, primarily due to higher shareholder servicing fees, higher brokerage income and higher mutual fund reimbursements, partially offset by lower investment income related to our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Other revenues decreased $1.1 million, or 1.1%, in 2019, primarily due to lower brokerage income and lower investment income related to our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds, partially offset by higher shareholder servicing fees.\nExpenses\nThe components of expenses are as follows:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020-19 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019-18 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee compensation and benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,494,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,442,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,378,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Promotion and servicing: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution-related payments </td> <td>569,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>487,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>427,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred sales commissions </td> <td>27,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade execution, marketing, T&E and other </td> <td>189,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>786,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>722,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>671,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>485,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>484,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>448,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate charges </td> <td>5,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>491,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>488,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>456,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent payment arrangements </td> <td>1,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(510) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,219) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> <td> </td> <td>(77.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on borrowings </td> <td>6,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets </td> <td>21,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,801,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,694,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,542,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\nEmployee compensation and benefits consist of base compensation (including salaries and severance), annual short-term incentive compensation awards (cash bonuses), annual long-term incentive compensation awards, commissions, fringe benefits and other employment costs (including recruitment, training, temporary help and meals).\nCompensation expense as a percentage of net revenues was 40.3%, 41.0% and 40.9% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Compensation expense generally is determined on a discretionary basis and is primarily a function of our firm's current-year financial performance. The amounts of incentive compensation we award are designed to motivate, reward and retain top talent while aligning our executives' interests with the interests of our Unitholders. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of AllianceBernstein Corporation ( Compensation Committee\u201d), periodically confirms that the appropriate metric to consider in determining the amount of incentive compensation is the ratio of adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues. Adjusted net revenues used in the adjusted compensation ratio are the same as the adjusted net revenues presented as a non-GAAP measure (discussed earlier in this Item 7). Adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense is total employee compensation and benefits expense minus other employment costs such as recruitment, training, temporary help and meals (which were 0.9%, 1.2% and 1.1% of adjusted net revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively), and excludes the impact of mark-to-market vesting expense, as well as dividends and interest expense, associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments and the amortization expense associated with the awards issued by EQH to our firm's CEO relating to his role as a member of the EQH Management Committee. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee, has established as an objective that adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense generally should not exceed 50% of our adjusted net revenues, except in unexpected or unusual circumstances. Our ratios of adjusted compensation expense as a percentage of adjusted net revenues were 47.9%, 47.9% and 47.5%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIn 2020, employee compensation and benefits expense increased $51.4 million, or 3.6%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation of $58.8 million and higher base compensation of $13.5 million (primarily higher base salaries), offset by lower fringes of $8.5 million, lower commissions of $6.2 million and lower other employment costs of $6.2 million. In 2019, employee compensation and benefits expense increased $64.0 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to higher base compensation of $34.1 million (primarily higher salaries), higher incentive compensation of $17.4 million and higher fringes of $15.6 million, partially offset by lower commissions of $3.2 million.\nPromotion and Servicing\nPromotion and servicing expenses include distribution-related payments to financial intermediaries for distribution of AB mutual funds and amortization of deferred sales commissions paid to financial intermediaries for the sale of back-end load shares of AB mutual funds. Also included in this expense category are costs related to travel and entertainment, advertising and promotional materials.\nPromotion and servicing expenses increased $63.6 million, or 8.8%, in 2020. The increase primarily was due to higher distribution-related payments of $81.3 million, higher amortization of deferred sales commissions of $12.3 million, higher trade execution and clearance expenses of $7.9 million and higher transfer fees of $4.8 million, offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses of $34.3 million and lower marketing expenses of $8.4 million. The decrease in travel and entertainment and marketing expense is primarily a result of cost savings associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect these costs to increase in 2021 and further normalize in 2022, as the pandemic recedes. Promotion and servicing expenses increased $51.7 million, or 7.7%, in 2019. The increase primarily was due to higher distribution-related payments of $60.8 million and higher travel and entertainment expenses of $3.2 million, offset by lower amortization of deferred sales commissions of $6.3 million, lower trade execution and clearance expenses of $3.7 million and lower marketing expenses of $2.5 million.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include portfolio services expenses, technology expenses, professional fees and office-related expenses (occupancy, communications and similar expenses). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 13.2% (13.1% excluding real estate charges), 13.9% (13.8% excluding real estate charges) and 13.5% (13.3% excluding real estate charges) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $3.0 million, or 0.6%, during 2020, primarily due to higher technology fees of $4.7 million, higher charitable contributions of $3.9 million, higher portfolio service fees of $3.6 million, higher real estate charges of $2.2 million and higher other taxes of $1.6 million, partially offset by lower professional fees of $9.1 million and lower office-related expenses of $3.5 million. General and administrative expenses increased $31.9 million, or 7.0%, during 2019, primarily due to higher portfolio service fees of $11.2 million, higher technology fees of $11.0 million and higher professional fees of $7.0 million.\nContingent Payment Arrangements\nContingent payment arrangements reflect changes in estimates of contingent payment liabilities associated with acquisitions in previous periods, as well as accretion expense of these liabilities. The expense of $1.9 million for 2020 reflects accretion expense of $3.3 million, offset by the change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2016 acquisition of $1.4 million. The credit of $0.5 million for 2019 reflects the change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2016 acquisition of $3.1 million, offset by accretion expenses of $2.6 million. The credit of $2.2 million for 2018 reflects the change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2016 acquisition of $2.4 million, offset by accretion expenses of $0.2 million.\nInterest on Borrowings\nInterest expense decreased 52.6% in 2020, reflecting lower interest rates partially offset by higher weighted average borrowings. Average daily borrowings for both the EQH facility and commercial paper were $554.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 0.5% during 2020 compared to $436.9 million and 2.5% during 2019. Interest expense increased 25.8% in 2019, reflecting both higher weighted average borrowings and interest rates. Average daily borrowings for both the EQH facility and commercial paper were $436.9 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.5% during 2019 compared to $350.3 million and 2.0% for commercial paper during 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nAB, a private limited partnership, is not subject to federal or state corporate income taxes. However, AB is subject to a 4.0% New York City unincorporated business tax ( UBT\u201d). Our domestic corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income taxes, and generally are included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return. Separate state and local income tax returns also are filed. Foreign corporate subsidiaries generally are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions where they are located.\nIncome tax expense increased $3.9 million, or 9.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019. This increase is due to higher pre-tax book income, offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate in 2020 of 5.0% compared to 5.1% in 2019. The decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by a reduction of one-time discrete items.\nIncome tax expense decreased $4.1 million, or 8.9%, in 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease is due to a lower effective tax rate in 2019 of 5.1% compared to 5.6% in 2018. The decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by a more favorable mix of earnings across the AB tax filing groups and a reduction of one-time discrete items.\nNet Income (Loss) of Consolidated Entities Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income (loss) of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests primarily consists of limited partner interests owned by other investors in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2020, we had $4.2 million of net losses of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to losses on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2019 and 2018, we had $29.6 million and $21.9 million, respectively, of net gains of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to gains on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Fluctuations period-to-period result primarily from the number of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and their respective market performance.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nCash flows from operating activities primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and services fees and other revenues offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Our cash flows from operating activities have historically been positive and sufficient in supporting our operations. We do not anticipate this to change in the foreseeable future. Cash flows from investing activities generally consist of small capital expenditures and, when applicable, business acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities primarily consist of issuance and repayment of debt and the repurchase of AB Holding units to fund our long-term deferred compensation plans. We are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow to our Unitholders and the General Partner.\nDuring 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, compared to $827.5 million during 2019. The change primarily was due to net activity of our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $468.2 million, an increase in broker-dealer related payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity) of $368.0 million, a decrease in other assets of $92.3 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $67.2 million and an increase in accrued compensation of $54.4 million, partially offset by higher net purchases of broker-dealer investments of $454.1 million. During 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $827.5 million, compared to $1.3 billion during 2018. The change primarily was due to a decrease in broker-dealer related payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity) of $754.8 million and net activity of our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $427.6 million, offset by lower net purchases of broker-dealer investments of $754.7 million.\nDuring 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $59.1 million, compared to $23.0 million during 2019. The change is primarily due to $13.6 millions paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $4.1 million paid for equity method investments and higher purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements of $13.2 million. During 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $23.0 million, compared to $32.8 million during 2018. The change is primarily due to the acquisition of Autonomous, net of cash acquired, of $5.3 million.\nDuring 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion, compared to $775.0 million during 2019. The change reflects higher redemptions of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $369.1 million and higher distributions to the General Partner and Unitholders of $133.4 million, partially offset by higher net proceeds of debt of $112.9 million and an increase in overdrafts payable of $47.3 million. During 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $775.0 million, compared to $1.6 billion during 2018. The change reflects the net purchases of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in 2019 as compared to net redemptions of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in 2018 (impact of $622.2 million), lower distributions to the General Partner and Unitholders of $154.7 million and lower net purchases of AB Holding Units to fund long-term incentive compensation plan awards of $95.5 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, AB had $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash and cash equivalents of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds), all of which is available for liquidity but consist primarily of cash on deposit for our broker-dealers related to various customer clearing activities, and cash held by foreign subsidiaries of $586.3 million.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nSee Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for disclosures relating to our debt and credit facilities.\nOur financial condition and access to public and private debt markets should provide adequate liquidity for our general business needs. Management believes that cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and AB Units or AB Holding Units will provide us with the resources we need to meet our financial obligations. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Item 7 for a discussion of credit markets and our ability to renew our credit facilities at expiration.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nGuarantees\nUnder various circumstances, AB guarantees the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAB maintains guarantees in connection with the Credit Facility (the \"Credit Facility\") and Revolver (the \"Revolver\"). If SCB LLC is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand. In addition, AB maintains guarantees totaling $365.0 million for SCB LLC's three uncommitted lines of credit.\nAB maintains a guarantee with a commercial bank, under which we guarantee the obligations in the ordinary course of business of each of SCB LLC, our U.K.-based broker-dealer and our Cayman subsidiary. We also maintain three additional guarantees with other commercial banks under which we guarantee approximately $294.7 million of obligations for our U.K.-based broker-dealer and $99.0 million of obligations for our India-based broker-dealer. In the event that any of these three entities is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand.\nWe also have two smaller guarantees with a commercial bank totaling approximately $2.1 million, under which we guarantee certain obligations in the ordinary course of business of one of our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe have not been required to perform under any of the above agreements and currently have no liability in connection with these agreements.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQH credit facility </td> <td>$ </td> <td>675.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>675.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases, net of sublease commitments </td> <td>851.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>526.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding commitments </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued compensation and benefits </td> <td>309.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FIN 48 reserve </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal transition tax </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,862.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>987.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2010, as general partner of AllianceBernstein U.S. Real Estate L.P. ( Real Estate Fund\u201d), we committed to invest $25.0 million in the Real Estate Fund. As of December 31, 2020, we had funded $22.4 million of this commitment. During 2014, as general partner of AllianceBernstein U.S. Real Estate II L.P. ( Real Estate Fund II\u201d), we committed to invest $27.3 million, as amended in 2020, in the Real Estate Fund II. As of December 31, 2020, we had funded $20.8 million of this commitment.\nAccrued compensation and benefits amounts in the table above exclude our accrued pension obligation. Offsetting our accrued compensation obligations are long-term incentive compensation-related investments and money market investments we funded totaling $67.0 million, which are included in our consolidated statement of financial condition. Any amounts reflected on the\nconsolidated statement of financial condition as payables (to broker-dealers, brokerage clients and company-sponsored mutual funds) and accounts payable and accrued expenses (excluding the tax obligations above) are excluded from the table above.\nWe expect to make contributions to our qualified profit sharing plan of approximately $15 million in each of the next four years. We do not currently anticipate that we will contribute to the Retirement Plan during 2021.\nThe 2017 Tax Act (enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017) imposed a federal transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of certain deferred foreign earnings. Management elected to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight-year period from 2018 to 2025. The federal transition tax obligation is recorded to income tax payable on our consolidated statement of financial condition. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our taxes.\nDuring October 2018, we signed a lease, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020, relating to 218,976 square feet of space at our newly constructed Nashville headquarters. Our estimated total base rent obligation (excluding taxes, operating expenses and utilities) over the 15-year initial lease term is $134.0 million. During April 2019, we signed a lease, which commences in 2024, relating to approximately 190,000 square feet of newly constructed space in New York City. Our estimated total base rent obligation (excluding taxes, operating expenses and utilities) over the 20-year lease term is approximately $448.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we exercised an option to return a half floor of this space, which reduced our square footage from approximately 190,000 to 166,000 square feet and our base rent obligation from $448.0 million to $393.0 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion of our leases.\nSee Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our debt.\nContingencies\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\nManagement believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve significant management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used.\nGoodwill\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had goodwill of $3.1 billion on the consolidated statement of financial condition. We have determined that AB has only one reporting segment and reporting unit. We test our goodwill annually, as of September 30, for impairment. As of September 30, 2020, the impairment test indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The carrying value of goodwill is also reviewed if facts and circumstances occur that suggest possible impairment, such as significant declines in AUM, revenues, earnings or the price of an AB Holding Unit.\nOn an annual basis, or when circumstances warrant, goodwill is tested for impairment utilizing the market approach where the fair value of the reporting unit is based on its unadjusted market valuation (AB Units outstanding multiplied by AB Holding's Unit price) and earnings multiples. The price of a publicly-traded AB Holding Unit serves as a reasonable starting point for valuing an AB Unit because each represents the same fractional interest in our underlying business. Our market approach analysis also includes comparable industry earnings multiples applied to our earnings forecast and assumes a control premium (when applicable).\nThroughout the year, the carrying value of goodwill is also reviewed for impairment if certain events or changes in circumstances occur, and trigger whether an interim impairment test may be required. Such changes in circumstances may include, but are not limited to, a sustained decrease in the price of an AB Unit or declines in AB's market capitalization that would suggest that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount; significant and unanticipated declines in AB's assets under management or revenues; and/or lower than expected earnings per unit. Any of these changes in circumstances could suggest the possibility that goodwill is impaired, but none of these events or circumstances by itself would indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. Instead, they are merely recognized as triggering events for the consideration of impairment and must be viewed in combination with any mitigating or positive factors. A holistic evaluation of all events since the most recent quantitative impairment test must be done to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit is impaired.\nAs of January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The guidance removed Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which had required a hypothetical purchase price allocation. As a result of the revised guidance, a goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Under this guidance, the goodwill impairment test no longer includes a determination by management of whether a decline in fair value is temporary; however, it is important to consider the impact of changing market conditions, including the severity and anticipated duration, is reflected in management's determination of fair value.\nLoss Contingencies\nManagement continuously reviews with legal counsel the status of regulatory matters and pending or threatened litigation. We evaluate the likelihood that a loss contingency exists and record a loss contingency if it is both probable and reasonably estimable as of the date of the financial statements. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nCautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements provided by management in this report are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The most significant of these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: the performance of financial markets, the investment performance of sponsored investment products and separately-managed accounts, general economic conditions, industry trends, future acquisitions, integration of acquired companies, competitive conditions and government regulations, including changes in tax regulations and rates and the manner in which the earnings of publicly-traded partnerships are taxed. We caution readers to carefully consider such factors. Further, these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. For further information regarding these forward-looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ, see Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. Any or all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this Form 10-K, other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, and any other public statements we issue, may turn out to be wrong. It is important to remember that other factors besides those listed in Risk Factors\u201d and those listed below could also adversely impact our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nThe forward-looking statements referred to in the preceding paragraph, most of which directly affect AB but also affect AB Holding because AB Holding's principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB, include statements regarding:\n\u2022Our belief that the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB will provide AB Holding with the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations: AB Holding's cash flow is dependent on the quarterly cash distributions it receives from AB. Accordingly, AB Holding's ability to meet its financial obligations is dependent on AB's cash flow from its operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets and other factors beyond our control.\n\u2022Our financial condition and ability to access the public and private capital markets providing adequate liquidity for our general business needs: Our financial condition is dependent on our cash flow from operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets, our ability to maintain and grow client assets under management and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to access public and private capital markets on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, our firm's credit ratings, our profitability and changes in government regulations, including tax rates and interest rates.\n\u2022The outcome of litigation: Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive damage awards do occur. Though we have stated that we do not expect any pending legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, any settlement or judgment with respect to a legal proceeding could be significant, and could have such an effect.\n\u2022The possibility that we will engage in open market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program: The number of AB Holding Units AB may decide to buy in future periods, if any, to help fund incentive compensation awards depends on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the fluctuation in the price of an AB Holding Unit (NYSE: AB) and the availability of cash to make these purchases.\n\u2022Our determination that adjusted employee compensation expense should not exceed 50% of our adjusted net revenues: Aggregate employee compensation reflects employee performance and competitive compensation levels. Fluctuations in our revenues and/or changes in competitive compensation levels could result in adjusted employee compensation expense exceeding 50% of our adjusted net revenues.\n\u2022Our Relocation Strategy: While the expenses, expense savings and EPU impact we expect will result from our Relocation Strategy are presented with numerical specificity, and we believe these figures to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions on which our estimates are based create a significant risk that our current estimates may not be realized. These assumptions include:\n\u2022the amount and timing of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs we experience; and\n\u2022the timing for execution of each phase of our relocation implementation plan.\n\u2022The Adverse Impact of COVID-19: The severity of the expected adverse impact on our AUM and revenues of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on the depth and length of the downturn and its impact on the companies in which we invest. Our conclusions about the possible continuing significant adverse impact on us is based on our assumptions that the recovery will be gradual and that there will be lasting high unemployment and economic damage. We believe that these assumptions are reasonable, but they may not be correct and economic conditions likely will differ from our assumptions.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nImpact of COVID-19\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 significantly impacted the global economy. The impact has been profound, has continued through the fourth quarter of 2020 and is likely to persist for months to come. While many businesses have re-opened, vaccinations have begun and leading economic indicators are showing signs of improvement, the overall extent and duration of COVID-19's impact on businesses and economic activity generally remains unclear. A recession in the near term remains possible. Economic effects from COVID-19, which have impacted virtually all countries and industries, include:\n\u2022Many small and large businesses being forced to interrupt their operations and as a result, lay off employees or even close;\n\u2022The re-opening and subsequent shuttering again of certain businesses in various countries around the world;\n\u2022Temporary large-scale population lock-downs, domestic and international travel restrictions and social-distancing measures were implemented, driving sharp declines in consumer and business spending. Further, while many businesses have re-opened, some are only allowing limited capacity, imposing social distancing restrictions and providing limited hours of operation, and while consumer spending has improved during the second half of 2020, uncertainty remains;\n\u2022Schools, many of which were shuttered during the first quarter, have allowed students to return to in-person instruction, but the constant concern and uncertainty of whether an outbreak may occur, have forced many schools to re-implement remote instruction, creating significant strain and uncertainty for working parents, which may slow or reverse the economic recovery;\n\u2022Significant declines and increased volatility impacted global financial markets during the first quarter, including 23.2% and 20.0% declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( Dow\u201d) and S&P 500 Index ( S&P\u201d), respectively. Although the financial markets recovered their first quarter losses to new highs in the months since, the prospect of continued volatility remains, especially given the uncertainty surrounding the continued economic effects of the virus (please see \"Market Environment\" below for additional details).\n\u2022The initial distribution of multiple COVID-19 vaccinations was initiated in the later part of the fourth quarter, but the speed, selective nature and logistical challenges of distribution, and the concerns in some communities around the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, have caused turmoil for many, further heightening the anxiety around the virus.\nGovernments around the world have responded to COVID-19 with economic stimulus measures, including a $2 trillion emergency relief bill passed in the U.S during the first quarter of 2020 and an additional $900 billion in aid passed during the fourth quarter of 2020. Similar fiscal stimulus was passed by many governments around the world. These measures and possible additional stimulus and aid measures are intended to steady businesses and consumers until economic activity meaningfully recovers. The timing and magnitude of any such recovery, however, remains uncertain.\nVarious countries around the world have continued to experience surges in the rates of COVID-19 infections, which are likely the result of greatly increased social interactions, including at colleges and universities, after re-opening of economies, as well as more contagious strains of the virus. As a result, several countries have paused the continued progression of their re-openings or re-imposed closing mandates on certain businesses, such as bars, restaurants and entertainment venues. These circumstances may adversely affect consumer sentiment and the pace of business re-openings, and they also may delay any economic recovery.\nAB Impact\nAt the initial onset of COVID-19 during the first quarter of 2020, we quickly responded in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the U.S., the U.K., Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore and Taiwan. We implemented business continuity measures, including travel restrictions and a work-from-home requirement for almost all personnel (other than a relatively small number of employees whose physical presence in our offices was considered critical), which has remained in place (except in our Asia offices, most of which have reopened) throughout the second, third and fourth quarters, to ensure operating continuity for all critical functions. We also instituted a notification process for any employee who tests positive for COVID-19 or has been exposed to someone else who has tested positive. As the COVID-19 crisis has continued to evolve since the lockdown in the first quarter, certain key functions of the business, such as Risk Management, Business Continuity, Finance and Human Capital, have maintained constant communication and monitored the evolution of the pandemic to keep our employees safe and advise of key developments. Additionally, we continue to monitor communications from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure we have current information.\nWe have continued to enhance our technology, which has increased the effectiveness of our remote work force. We have also continued to enhance our virtual programs to support business functions, such as training on cybersecurity and enhancements to our existing technology platforms. There has been a heightened focus on the emotional well-being of our employees, and we have provided regular touch points with employees through virtual town halls and management communications. Additionally, we have maintained regular communications and updates on the virus and the Company's response, which are posted on the Company's internal website, to ensure transparent communication with our employees. If any of our employees test positive for COVID-19 or interact with someone who has the virus, they are required to contact AB immediately for support and contact-tracing.\nWe continue to consider, and in some cases methodically implement, return to office programs for our U.S., European and Asia offices. However, we continue to monitor the daily evolution of the crisis in order to ensure the health and safety of our employees remains our top priority. We will modify our return to office plans, as needed, to ensure the safety of our employees and to ensure that the highest safety and cleanliness protocols are followed. We believe that our business continuity plan and technology platform will continue to support the effectiveness of our employees working remotely.\nAsset managers, such as AB, rely heavily on the performance of the financial markets largely to determine assets under management ( AUM\u201d) and revenues. Our results during the first quarter of 2020 were strong, which was primarily a reflection of financial market conditions during January and February, which were not adversely affected by COVID-19. Market conditions deteriorated dramatically during March, which negatively impacted our performance in that month. Financial markets, and hence our performance, rebounded during the ensuing months, primarily due to a U.S. Federal Government stimulus package and U.S. Treasury programs, which were instituted during March 2020 and throughout the second quarter. These programs renewed confidence in the financial markets by introducing liquidity through government purchasing of financial instruments. As various states and countries around the world eased restrictions on business and lockdown protocols during the second quarter and increasingly throughout the third and fourth quarters, increases in consumer spending, decreases in the unemployment rate and improvement in other leading economic indicators have stimulated domestic and global financial market performance. As a result of these developments, our AUM has increased in the second, third and fourth quarters. However, as U.S. states and countries globally have continued to ease restrictions, there has been a resurgence in the spread of the virus, causing certain states and countries to, among other things, shutter some businesses again or impose new social distancing restrictions. As a result, market volatility continues.\nThe economic impact of COVID-19 and any additional declines in the financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our AUM and revenues, particularly if economic activity does not continue to recover. Although countries throughout the world continue to grapple with re-opening their economies, this will continue to be a gradual process, and there is a significant risk that the opening process may be further interrupted if infection rates increase. Also, although unemployment rates have declined, they are still considered high and any reluctance of consumers to resume spending will do long-term damage to the global economy, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, as most of our workforce is working remotely, we are mindful of increased risk related to cybersecurity, which could significantly disrupt our business functions.\nUltimately, the return to normal business and economic activity will likely require the broad application of effective vaccines. Although the distribution of multiple vaccines was initiated towards the end of the fourth quarter, the speed, selective nature of those who are eligible to receive the vaccination, as well as logistical challenges regarding availability and distribution of the vaccines, could mean many months until the general population has been vaccinated.\nExecutive Overview\nPercentage change figures are calculated using assets under management rounded to the nearest million and financial statement amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.\nOur total assets under management (\"AUM\") as of December 31, 2020 were $685.9 billion, up $63.0 billion, or 10.1%, during 2020. The increase was driven primarily by market appreciation of $65.4 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $2.6 billion (due to Private Wealth Management net outflows of $2.0 billion and Retail net outflows of $1.6 billion, offset by Institutional net inflows of $1.0 billion). Excluding AXA's redemption of low-fee fixed income mandates of $11.8 billion, the firm generated net inflows of $9.2 billion in 2020.\nInstitutional AUM increased $32.9 billion, or 11.6%, to $315.6 billion during 2020, primarily due to market appreciation of $30.5 billion and net inflows of $1.0 billion. Gross sales increased $13.8 billion, from $17.1 billion in 2019 to $30.9 billion in 2020. Redemptions and terminations increased $11.3 billion, from $12.0 billion in 2019 to $23.3 billion in 2020. Excluding AXA's redemption of low-fee fixed income mandates of $11.8 billion, institutional net inflows were $12.8 billion in 2020.\nRetail AUM increased $26.1 billion, or 10.9%, to $265.3 billion during 2020, primarily due to market appreciation of $28.1 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $1.6 billion. Gross sales increased $3.6 billion, from $75.3 billion in 2019 to $78.9\nbillion in 2020. Redemptions and terminations increased $25.5 billion, from $44.0 billion in 2019 to $69.5 billion in 2020, due to record first quarter 2020 redemptions, reflecting the financial market sell-off in March amidst the onset of COVID-19.\nPrivate Wealth Management AUM increased $4.0 billion, or 3.9%, to $105.0 billion during 2020, primarily due to market appreciation of $6.8 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $2.0 billion. Gross sales increased $3.0 billion, from $11.3 billion in 2019 to $14.3 billion in 2020. Redemptions and terminations increased $4.1 billion, from $12.4 billion in 2019 to $16.5 billion in 2020.\nBernstein Research Services revenue increased $51.8 million, or 12.7%, in 2020. The increase was due to higher market volatility, particularly between March and June 2020, primarily as a result of COVID-19, which led to higher customer activity and greater global trading volumes. We expect customer activity and trading volumes to gradually decrease in 2021 and to normalize in 2022, as the volatility surrounding COVID-19 begins to decline. Any decreases in customer activity and trading volumes will have a corresponding effect on Bernstein Research services revenue. Furthermore, all of 2020 reflects the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Autonomous Research (\"Autonomous\"), which closed on April 1, 2019.\nOur 2020 net revenues of $3.7 billion increased $190.1 million, or 5.4%, compared to the prior year's net revenues. The most significant contributors to the increase were higher base advisory fees of $90.4 million, higher distribution revenues of $74.7 million, higher Bernstein Research Services revenue of $51.8 million and higher performance-based fees of $33.0 million, partially offset by higher investment losses of $55.1 million and lower net dividend and interest income of $11.9 million. Our operating expenses of $2.8 billion increased $106.1 million, or 3.9%, compared to the prior year's expenses. The increase primarily was due to higher promotion and servicing expenses of $63.6 million, higher employee compensation and benefits of $51.4 million and higher general and administrative expenses (including real estate charges) of $3.0 million, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets of $7.4 million and lower interest on borrowings of $6.9 million. Our operating income increased $84.0 million, or 10.2%, to $907.4 million from $823.4 million in 2019 and our operating margin increased from 22.6% in 2019 to 24.6% in 2020.\nMarket Environment\nDespite 2020 being a year marked by a global pandemic, record-breaking recession and unemployment levels, and a contentious U.S. presidential election, equity markets closed the year with solid gains. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq each rallied for most of the fourth quarter, finishing the year in positive territory. In the U.S., the presidential election passed with a market-friendly outcome, the distribution of multiple COVID-19 vaccines was initiated and the unemployment rate continued to decline. Meanwhile, after months of deadlock, a COVID-19 relief package was passed in the fourth quarter, consisting of direct payments, unemployment benefits and small business aid. However, even with the increasing likelihood of COVID-19 vaccines potentially boosting activity in 2021, significant slack in the economy and labor market by the end of this year are likely. As a result, the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely keep interest rates near zero as the economy improves.\nIn the U.K., COVID-19 and Brexit uncertainty resulted in the worst performing year for its equity market since the 2008 financial crisis. However, with a Brexit deal reached in the final days of 2020 between the U.K. and the E.U. and the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine, the U.K. economy may rebound in 2021. The Bank of England is likely to keep rates on hold during the recovery phase. In China, the economy has returned to almost pre-pandemic output levels. Chinese efforts to re-center the economy on a consumer-led model are expected to continue and fiscal policy will likely remain supportive through 2021. More stimulus may be announced in the first quarter of 2021 as the government continues to support consumption. While the economic outlook for China in 2021 appears positive, one big unknown is the future of the relationship between China and the new U.S. administration.\nMiFID II\nIn Europe, MiFID II, which became effective on January 3, 2018, has made significant modifications to the manner in which European broker-dealers can be compensated for research. These modifications are believed to have significantly reduced the overall research spend by European buy-side firms, which has decreased the revenues we derive from our European clients. Our European clients may continue to reduce their research budgets, which could result in a significant decline in our sell-side revenues.\nAlso, while MiFID II is not applicable to firms operating outside of Europe, competitive and client pressures may force buy-side firms operating outside of Europe to pay for research from their own resources instead of through bundled trading commissions. If that occurs, we would expect that research budgets from those clients will decrease further, which could result in an additional significant decline in our sell-side revenues. Additionally, these competitive and client pressures may result in our buy-side operation paying for research out of our own resources instead of through bundled trading commissions, which could increase our firm's expenses and decrease our operating income.\nThe ultimate impact of MiFID II on payments for research globally remains uncertain.\nEquitable Holdings IPO\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, AXA S.A. (\"AXA\") completed the sale of a minority stake in Equitable Holdings, Inc. ( EQH\u201d) through an initial public offering (\"IPO\"). Since then, AXA has completed additional offerings and taken other steps, most recently during the fourth quarter of 2019. As a result, AXA owned less than 10% of the outstanding common stock of EQH as of December 31, 2020.\nWhile we cannot at this time predict the full impact on AB of this transaction, such impact has included a reduction in the support AXA provided to AB in the past with respect to AB's investment management business, resulting in a modest decrease in our revenues and ability to initiate new investment services. Also, AB relies on AXA, including its subsidiary, AXA Business Services, for several significant services and AB has benefited from its affiliation with AXA in certain common vendor relationships. Some of these arrangements have changed, and others are expected to change, with immaterial financial implications for AB.\nOur ending AUM at December 31, 2020 reflects $11.8 billion in 2020 outflows resulting from AXA's redemption of certain low-fee fixed income mandates. We expect these redemptions to total approximately $14 billion, with the remaining redemptions expected to be completed during the first half of 2021. The revenue we earn from the management of these assets is not significant.\nRelocation Strategy\nOn May 2, 2018, we announced that we would establish our corporate headquarters in, and relocate approximately 1,050 jobs located in the New York metro area to, Nashville, TN. Subsequently, on January 14, 2020, we announced our plans to relocate an additional 200 jobs to Nashville thereby increasing the total relocated jobs to 1,250. The decision to add the additional jobs was the result of the growth in our business, select investments we are making, and the in-sourcing of roles typically performed by consultants. Our Nashville headquarters will house Finance, IT, Operations, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, Human Capital, and Sales and Marketing. We have been actively relocating jobs and expect this transition to take several years. We will continue to maintain a principal location in New York City, which will house our Portfolio Management, Sell-Side Research and Trading, and New York-based Private Wealth Management businesses.\nWe believe relocating our corporate headquarters to Nashville will afford us the opportunity to provide an improved quality of life alternative for our employees and enable us to attract and recruit new talented employees to a highly desirable location while improving the long-term cost structure of the firm.\nDuring the transition period, which began in 2018 and is expected to continue through 2024, we currently estimate we will incur transition costs of approximately $145 million to $155 million, which is less than our previous estimate of $155 million to $165 million. These costs include employee relocation, severance, recruitment, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. Over this same period, we expect to realize total expense savings of approximately $205 million to $215 million, which is greater than our previous estimate of $185 million to $195 million, and is an amount greater than the total transition costs. However, we did incur some transition costs before we began to realize expense savings. For the period beginning in 2018 and ending in 2020, we incurred $70 million of cumulative transition costs compared to $46 million of cumulative savings. In 2020, expense savings of $30 million were greater than transition costs of $26 million, resulting in a net increase of $0.01 in net income per unit ( EPU\u201d). We currently anticipate an EPU increase in 2021 of approximately $0.02 and expect to achieve increasing EPU accretion in each year thereafter. Beginning in 2025, once the transition period has been completed, we estimate ongoing annual expense savings towards the upper end of the range of $75 million to $80 million, which will result from a combination of occupancy and compensation-related savings. Our estimates for both the transition costs and the corresponding expense savings are based upon our current assumptions of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. In addition, our estimates for both the timing of when we incur transition costs and realize the related expense savings are based on our current relocation implementation plan and the timing for execution of each phase. The actual total charges we eventually record, the related expense savings we realize, and timing of EPU impact may differ from our current estimates as we implement each phase of our headquarters relocation.\nDuring October 2018, we signed a lease, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020, relating to 218,976 square feet of space at our new Nashville headquarters. Our estimated total base rent obligation (excluding taxes, operating expenses and utilities) over the 15-year initial lease term is $134 million.\nAlthough we have presented our transition costs and annual expense savings with numerical specificity, and we believe these targets to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions we discuss above create a significant risk that these targets may not be achieved. Accordingly, the expenses we actually incur and the savings we actually realize may differ from our targets, particularly if actual events adversely differ from one or more of our key assumptions. The transition costs and expense savings, together with their underlying assumptions, are Forward-Looking Statements and can be affected by any of the factors discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this 10-K. We strongly caution investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or our cost and expense targets. Except as may be required by applicable securities laws, we are not under any obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any assumptions, estimates, financial goals, targets, projections or other related statements that we may make.\nAdjusted Operating Margin Target\nWe previously adopted a goal of increasing our adjusted operating margin to a target of 30% by 2020 (the 2020 Margin Target\u201d), subject to the assumptions, factors and contingencies described as part of our initial disclosure of this target. Our adjusted operating margin, which was 27.5% for 2019, increased to 30.1% for 2020, achieving our target. We do not currently expect to set a new adjusted operating margin target going forward.\nOur AUM and, therefore, our investment advisory revenues, including performance-based fee revenues, are heavily dependent on the level and volatility of the financial markets, which ended 2020 favorably. Despite the challenges faced from the COVID-19 pandemic (please refer to Impact of COVID-19\u201d above and Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A), we benefited from certain of our adjusted operating expenses declining significantly, such as costs associated with travel and entertainment and client meetings during 2020. We do not anticipate the COVID-19-related cost-savings or market tailwinds to be indicative of future performance. We also expect continued investments in growth initiatives for our firm. Considering these factors, our adjusted operating margin may be less favorable in future periods, although we will continue to strive for improvement over the long-term.\nAB Holding\nAB Holding's principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB Units. The AB Holding financial statements, notes to the financial statements and and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with those of AB.\nResults of Operations\n\n________________________\n(1)Distributions reflect the impact of AB's non-GAAP adjustments.\nAB Holding had net income of $279.4 million in 2020 compared to $238.6 million in 2019, reflecting higher net income attributable to AB Unitholders. AB Holding had net income of $238.6 million in 2019 compared to $242.4 million in 2018, reflecting lower net income attributable to AB Unitholders and lower weighted average equity ownership interest.\nAB Holding's partnership gross income is derived from its interest in AB. AB Holding's income taxes, which reflect a 3.5% federal tax on its partnership gross income from the active conduct of a trade or business, are computed by multiplying certain AB qualifying revenues (primarily U.S. investment advisory fees, brokerage commissions and direct payments for research services) by AB Holding's ownership interest in AB, multiplied by the 3.5% tax rate. AB Holding's effective tax rate was 9.4% in 2020, 10.4% in 2019 and 10.4% in 2018. See Note 6 to AB Holding's financial statements in Item 8 for a further description.\nAs supplemental information, AB provides the performance measures adjusted net revenues,\u201d adjusted operating income\u201d and adjusted operating margin,\u201d which are the principal metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing the period-to-period operating performance of AB. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of AB's operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate charges (discussed below in Adjusted Operating Income) and other adjustment items. Similarly, management believes that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in AB's results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors. Such measures are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP measures\u201d). These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in evaluating the company's financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of AB's revenues and expenses. Further, adjusted diluted net income per AB Holding Unit is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures. See Management Operating Metrics\u201d in this Item 7.\nThe impact of these adjustments on AB Holding's net income and diluted net income per AB Holding Unit are as follows:\n\nThe degree to which AB's non-GAAP adjustments impact AB Holding's net income fluctuates based on AB Holding's ownership percentage in AB.\nTax Legislation\nFor a discussion of tax legislation, see Risk Factors - Structure-related Risks\u201d in Item 1A.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $270.0 million, compared to $222.8 million during the corresponding 2019 period. The increase primarily resulted from higher cash distributions received from AB of $49.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $222.8 million, compared to $279.3 million during the corresponding 2018 period. The decrease primarily resulted from lower cash distributions received from AB of $58.6 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million, $11.5 million and $16.6 million, respectively, reflecting investments in AB with proceeds from exercises of compensatory options to buy AB Holding Units.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $269.9 million, compared to $211.2 million during the corresponding 2019 period. The increase primarily was due to higher cash distributions to Unitholders of $48.4\nmillion and lower proceeds from exercise of compensatory options to buy AB Holding Units of $11.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $211.2 million, compared to $262.7 million during the corresponding 2018 period. The decrease primarily was due to lower cash distributions to Unitholders of $58.2 million, partially offset by lower proceeds from exercise of compensatory options to buy AB Holding Units of $5.1 million.\nManagement believes that AB Holding will have the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations as a result of the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB.\nCash Distributions\nAB Holding is required to distribute all of its Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Holding Partnership Agreement, to its Unitholders (including the General Partner). Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of units outstanding at the end of the quarter. Management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more adjustments made to adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. See Note 2 to AB Holding's financial statements in Item 8 for a description of Available Cash Flow.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nFor a discussion of commitments and contingencies, see Note 7 to AB Holding's financial statements in Item 8.\nAB\nAssets Under Management\nAssets under management by distribution channel are as follows:\n\nAssets under management by investment service are as follows:\n\n \n(1)Includes index and enhanced index services.\n(2)Includes certain multi-asset solutions and services not included in equity or fixed income services.\nChanges in assets under management during 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n\n \n(1)Approximately $900 million of non-investment management fee earning taxable and tax-exempt money market assets\nwere removed from assets under management during the second quarter of 2019.\n(2)Institutional net flows for 2020 include $11.8 billion of AXA redemptions of certain low-fee fixed income mandates.\n\n \n(1)Includes index and enhanced index services.\n(2)Includes certain multi-asset solutions and services not included in equity or fixed income services.\n(3)Fixed income - taxable investment service net flows for 2020 include $11.8 billion of AXA redemptions of certain low-fee fixed income mandates.\n(4)Approximately $900 million of non-investment management fee earning taxable and tax-exempt money market assets\nwere removed from assets under management during the second quarter of 2019.\nNet long-term inflows (outflows) for actively managed investment services as compared to passively managed investment services during 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n\nAverage assets under management by distribution channel and investment service are as follows:\n\n \n(1)Includes index and enhanced index services.\n(2)Includes certain multi-asset solutions and services not included in equity or fixed income services.\nDuring 2020, our Institutional channel average AUM of $285.9 billion increased $20.5 billion, or 7.7%, compared to 2019, primarily due to this AUM increasing $32.9 billion, or 11.6%, to $315.6 billion over the last twelve months. The $32.9 billion increase in AUM resulted primarily from market appreciation of $30.5 billion and net inflows of $1.0 billion. During 2019, our Institutional channel average AUM of $265.4 billion increased $7.3 billion, or 2.8%, compared to 2018, primarily due to this AUM increasing $36.4 billion, or 14.8%, to $282.7 billion during 2019. The $36.4 billion increase in AUM resulted from market appreciation of $34.0 billion and net inflows of $2.4 billion.\nDuring 2020, our Retail channel average AUM of $236.5 billion increased $24.2 billion, or 11.4%, compared to 2019, primarily due to this AUM increasing $26.1 billion, or 10.9%, to $265.3 billion over the last twelve months. The $26.1 billion increase in AUM resulted primarily from market appreciation of $28.1 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $1.6 billion. During 2019, our Retail channel average AUM of $212.3 billion increased $20.5 billion, or 10.7%, compared to 2018, primarily due to this AUM increasing $58.4 billion, or 32.3%, to $239.2 billion during 2019. The $58.4 billion increase in AUM resulted primarily from market appreciation of $34.5 billion and net inflows of $23.8 billion.\nDuring 2020, our Private Wealth Management channel average AUM of $97.1 billion increased $0.6 billion, or 0.7%, compared to 2019, primarily due to this AUM increasing $4.0 billion, or 3.9%, to $105.0 billion over the last twelve months. The $4.0 billion increase in AUM resulted primarily from market appreciation of $6.8 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $2.0 billion. During 2019, our Private Wealth Management channel average AUM of $96.5 billion increased $2.2 billion, or 2.3%, compared to 2018, primarily due to this AUM increasing $11.7 billion, or 13.2%, to $101.0 billion during 2019. The $11.7 billion increase in AUM resulted from market appreciation of $13.7 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $1.0 billion and an adjustment of $0.9 billion in the second quarter of 2019 relating to the removal of non-investment management fee earning assets.\nAbsolute investment composite returns, gross of fees, and relative performance as of December 31, 2020 compared to benchmarks for certain representative Institutional equity and fixed income services are as follows:\n\n\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\n \n(1)Operating income excluding net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests as a percentage of net revenues.\nNet income attributable to AB Unitholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $113.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase primarily is due to (in millions):\n\nNet income attributable to AB Unitholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $5.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease primarily was due to (in millions):\n\nUnits Outstanding\nEach quarter, we consider whether to implement a plan to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act\u201d). A plan of this type allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms and limitations specified in the plan. Repurchases are subject to regulations promulgated by the SEC, as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. The plan adopted during the fourth quarter of 2020 expired at the close of business on February 10, 2021. We may adopt additional plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes.\nCash Distributions\nWe are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Partnership Agreement, to our Unitholders and the General Partner. Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. In future periods, management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 for a description of Available Cash Flow.\nManagement Operating Metrics\nWe are providing the non-GAAP measures adjusted net revenues,\u201d adjusted operating income\u201d and adjusted operating margin\u201d because they are the principal operating metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing period-to-period operating performance. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of our operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, real estate charges and other adjustment items. Similarly, we believe that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in our results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\") and non-GAAP measures in evaluating our financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of our revenues and expenses.\n\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $115.6 million, or 14.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher investment advisory base fees of $74.1 million, higher Bernstein Research Services revenue of $51.8 million, lower promotion and servicing expenses of $33.4 million, higher performance-based fees of $33.2 million, lower amortization of intangibles of $7.4 million and lower interest on borrowings of $6.9 million, partially offset by higher employee compensation expenses (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $56.1 million, higher net investment losses of $22.8 million, lower net dividend and interest income of $8.5 million and higher general and administrative expenses of $8.2 million.\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $49.6 million, or 5.8%, from the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower performance-based fees of $99.3 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of $31.5 million, higher general and administrative expenses of $29.3 million and higher employee compensation expenses (excluding the impact of long-term incentive compensation-related items) of $8.3 million, offset by higher investment advisory base fees of $95.5 million and higher investments gains and losses revenue of $22.4 million.\nOn January 1, 2018, as a result of our adoption of ASC 606, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, of $35.0 million to partners' capital in the consolidated statement of financial condition. This amount represented carried interest distributions of $77.9 million previously received, net of revenue sharing payments to investment team members, of $42.7 million, with respect to which it was probable that significant reversal would not occur. These amounts were included in adjusted net revenues and adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2018.\nAdjusted Net Revenues\nNet Revenue, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the company's distribution revenues, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory services fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on the distinct arrangements, certain distribution fees are collected by us and passed through to third-party client intermediaries, while for certain other products, we collect investment advisory services fees and a portion is passed through to third-party client intermediaries. In both arrangements, the third-party client intermediary owns the relationship with the client and is responsible for performing services and distributing the product to the client on our behalf. We believe offsetting distribution revenues and certain investment advisory services fees is useful for our investors and other users of our financial statements because such presentation appropriately reflects the nature of these costs as pass-through payments to third parties that perform functions on behalf of our sponsored mutual funds and/or shareholders of these funds. Distribution-related adjustments fluctuate each period based on the type of investment products sold, as well as the average AUM over the period. Also, we adjust distribution revenues for the amortization of deferred sales commissions as these costs, over time, will offset such revenues.\nWe adjust investment advisory and services fees and other revenues for pass through costs, primarily related to our transfer agent and shareholder servicing fees. These fees do not affect operating income, but they do affect our operating margin. As such, we exclude these fees from adjusted net revenues.\nWe adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored investment funds' revenues and including AB's fees from such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and AB's investment gains and losses on its investments in such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds that were eliminated in consolidation.\nAlso, adjusted net revenues exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we wrote-off an investment that had been received in exchange for the sale of software technology, bringing the balance to zero. Previously, we had been excluding the value of this investment from adjusted net revenues.\nLastly, adjusted net revenues include the impact of our adoption of revenue recognition standard ASC 606 during the first quarter of 2018, as discussed above.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nAdjusted operating income represents operating income on a US GAAP basis excluding (1) real estate charges (credits), (2) the impact on net revenues and compensation expense of the investment gains and losses (as well as the dividends and interest) associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (3) our CEO's EQH award compensation, as discussed below, (4) the write-down of an investment (discussed immediately above), (5) acquisition-related expenses, (6) adjustments to contingent payment arrangements, and (7) the impact of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds; provided, however, that adjusted operating income includes the revenues and expenses associated with our implementation of ASC 606 during the first quarter of 2018 discussed above.\nReal estate charges (credits) have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers. However, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, real estate charges (credits), while excluded in the period in which the charges (credits) are recorded, are included ratably over the remaining applicable lease term.\nPrior to 2009, a significant portion of employee compensation was in the form of long-term incentive compensation awards that were notionally invested in AB investment services and generally vested over a period of four years. AB economically hedged the exposure to market movements by purchasing and holding these investments on its balance sheet. All such investments had vested as of year-end 2012 and the investments have been delivered to the participants, except for those investments with respect to which the participant elected a long-term deferral. Fluctuation in the value of these investments, which also impacts compensation expense, is recorded within investment gains and losses on the income statement. Management believes it is useful to reflect the offset achieved from economically hedging the market exposure of these investments in the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The non-GAAP measures exclude gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments included in revenues and compensation expense.\nThe board of directors of EQH granted to Seth P. Bernstein ( CEO\u201d), our President and Chief Executive Officer, equity awards in connection with EQH's IPO and Mr. Bernstein's membership on the EQH Management Committee. Mr. Bernstein may receive additional equity or cash compensation from EQH in the future related to his service on the Management Committee. Any awards granted to Mr. Bernstein by EQH are recorded as compensation expense in AB's consolidated statement of income. The compensation expense associated with these awards has been excluded from our non-GAAP measures because they are non-cash and are based upon EQH's, and not AB's, financial performance.\nThe write-off of the investment discussed above in Adjusted Net Revenues has been excluded due to its non-recurring nature and because it is not part of our core operating results.\nAcquisition-related expenses have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers. During 2020, these expenses included an intangible asset impairment charge of $1.5 million relating to our 2016 acquisition.\nThe recording of changes in estimates of contingent consideration payable with respect to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions are not considered part of our core operating results and, accordingly, have been excluded.\nAdjusted net revenues include the impact of our adoption of revenue recognition standard ASC 606 during the first quarter of 2018, as discussed above.\nWe adjusted for the operating income impact of consolidating certain company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored funds' revenues and expenses and including AB's revenues and expenses that were eliminated in consolidation. We also excluded the limited partner interests we do not own.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Net Income per AB Unit\nAs previously discussed, our quarterly distribution is typically our adjusted diluted net income per unit (which is derived from adjusted net income) for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. Adjusted income taxes, used in calculating adjusted net income, are calculated using the GAAP effective tax rate adjusted for non-GAAP income tax adjustments.\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating margin allows us to monitor our financial performance and efficiency from period to period without the volatility noted above in our discussion of adjusted operating income and to compare our performance to industry peers on a basis that better reflects our performance in our core business. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenues.\nNet Revenues\nThe components of net revenues are as follows:\n\nInvestment Advisory and Services Fees\nInvestment advisory and services fees are the largest component of our revenues. These fees generally are calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM as of a specified date, or as a percentage of the value of average AUM for the applicable billing period, and vary with the type of investment service, the size of account and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client. Accordingly, fee income generally increases or decreases as AUM increase or decrease and is affected by market appreciation or depreciation, the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts, withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts, purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares, shifts of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures, and acquisitions. Our average basis points realized (investment advisory and services fees divided by average AUM) generally approximate 30 to 110 basis points for actively-managed equity services, 10 to 75 basis points for actively-managed fixed income services and 2 to 20 basis points for passively-managed services. Average basis points realized for other services could range from 4 basis points for certain Institutional third party managed services to over 100 basis points for certain Retail and Private Wealth Management alternative services. These ranges include all-inclusive fee arrangements (covering investment management, trade execution and other services) for our Private Wealth Management clients.\nWe calculate AUM using established market-based valuation methods and fair valuation (non-observable market) methods. Market-based valuation methods include: last sale/settle prices from an exchange for actively-traded listed equities, options and futures; evaluated bid prices from recognized pricing vendors for fixed income, asset-backed or mortgage-backed issues; mid prices from recognized pricing vendors and brokers for credit default swaps; and quoted bids or spreads from pricing vendors and brokers for other derivative products. Fair valuation methods include: discounted cash flow models or any other\nmethodology that is validated and approved by our Valuation Committee (see paragraph immediately below for more information regarding our Valuation Committee). Fair valuation methods are used only where AUM cannot be valued using market-based valuation methods, such as in the case of private equity or illiquid securities.\nThe Valuation Committee, which consists of senior officers and employees, is responsible for overseeing the pricing and valuation of all investments held in client and AB portfolios. The Valuation Committee has adopted a Statement of Pricing Policies describing principles and policies that apply to pricing and valuing investments held in these portfolios. We also have a Pricing Group, which reports to the Valuation Committee and is responsible for overseeing the pricing process for all investments.\nWe sometimes charge our clients performance-based fees. In these situations, we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance-based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. Some performance-based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target (whether absolute or relative to a specified benchmark), it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance-based fees. Therefore, if we fail to achieve our performance target for a particular period, we will not earn a performance-based fee for that period and, for accounts with a high-watermark provision, our ability to earn future performance-based fees will be impaired. We are eligible to earn performance-based fees on 6.0%, 8.5% and 0.8% of the assets we manage for institutional clients, private wealth clients and retail clients, respectively (in total, 4.4% of our AUM).\nOur investment advisory and services fees increased by $123.4 million, or 5.0%, in 2020, due to a $90.4 million, or 3.8%, increase in base fees and a $33.0 million increase in performance-based fees. The increase in base fees is primarily due to an 7.9% increase in average AUM, partially offset by a lower portfolio fee rate. Our investment advisory and services fees increased by $109.8 million, or 4.6%, in 2019, due to a $128.4 million, or 5.7%, increase in base fees, which primarily resulted from a 5.5% increase in average AUM and the impact of a slight shift in product mix from fixed income to equities, which generally have higher fees. This increase was partially offset by an $18.5 million decrease in performance-based fees.\nInstitutional investment advisory and services fees increased $32.8 million, or 6.9%, in 2020, due to an increase in performance-based fees of $25.5 million and an increase in base fees of $7.3 million, or 1.6%. The increase in base fees is primarily due to an 7.7% increase in average AUM, partially offset by a lower portfolio fee rate. Institutional investment advisory and services fees increased $1.2 million, or 0.2%, in 2019, due to an increase in base fees of $6.2 million, or 1.4%, partially offset by a decrease in performance-based fees of $5.0 million. The increase in base fees was primarily due to a 2.8% increase in average AUM, partially offset by the impact of lower fee realization from active equities.\nRetail investment advisory and services fees increased $112.0 million, or 10.2%, in 2020, due to an increase in base fees of $110.1 million, or 10.2%, and a $1.9 million increase in performance-based fees. The increase in base fees is primarily due to a 11.4% increase in average AUM, partially offset by a lower portfolio fee rate. Retail investment advisory and services fees increased $88.7 million, or 8.8%, in 2019, due to an increase in base fees of $84.5 million, or 8.5%, and a $4.2 million increase in base fees. The increase in base fees was primarily due to a 10.7% increase in average AUM, partially offset by the impact of lower fee realization from active equities.\nPrivate Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees decreased by $21.4 million, or 2.4%, in 2020, due to a decrease in base fees of $27.0 million, or 3.2%, partially offset by a $5.6 million increase in performance-based fees. The decrease in base fees is primarily due to the impact of a lower portfolio fee rate, as well as a product mix shift with high fee value equity strategies now representing a lower percentage of our total AUM than in prior periods. Private Wealth Management investment advisory and services fees increased $20.0 million, or 2.3%, in 2019, due to an increase in base fees of $37.7 million, or 4.7%, partially offset by a decrease in performance-based fees of $17.7 million. The increase in base fees was primarily due to a 2.3% increase in average AUM and the impact of a shift in product mix to alternatives, which generally have higher fees.\nBernstein Research Services\nWe earn revenues for providing investment research to, and executing brokerage transactions for, institutional clients. These clients compensate us principally by directing us to execute brokerage transactions on their behalf, for which we earn commissions, and to a lesser extent, but increasingly, by paying us directly for research through commission sharing agreements or cash payments.\nRevenues from Bernstein Research Services increased $51.8 million, or 12.7%, in 2020. The increase was due to higher market volatility in 2020, particularly between March and June 2020, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to\nhigher customer activity and greater global trading volumes. We expect customer activity and trading volumes to gradually decrease in 2021 and to normalize in 2022, as the volatility surrounding COVID-19 begins to decline. Any decreases in customer activity and trading volumes will have a corresponding effect on Bernstein Research services revenue. Furthermore, all of 2020 reflects the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Autonomous (which closed on April 1, 2019).\nRevenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased $31.5 million, or 7.2%, in 2019. The decrease was due to lower global customer activity and trading commissions, partially offset by the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Autonomous (which closed on April 1, 2019).\nDistribution Revenues\nTwo of our subsidiaries act as distributors and/or placement agents of company-sponsored mutual funds and receive distribution services fees from certain of those funds as partial reimbursement of the distribution expenses they incur. Period-over-period fluctuations of distribution revenues typically are in line with fluctuations of the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds.\nDistribution revenues increased $74.7 million, or 16.4%, in 2020, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds increasing 13.2%. Distribution revenues increased $36.5 million, or 8.7%, in 2019, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds increasing 10.0%, offset by the impact of a shift in product mix from mutual funds that have higher distribution rates to mutual funds with lower distribution rates.\nDividend and Interest Income and Interest Expense\nDividend and interest income consists primarily of investment income and interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills as well as dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense principally reflects interest accrued on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts.\nDividend and interest income decreased $53.5 million, or 51.2%, in 2020, primarily due to lower interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills, as well as lower dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense decreased $41.6 million, or 72.6%, in 2020, due to lower interest paid on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts.\nDividend and interest income increased $6.2 million, or 6.3%, in 2019, primarily due to higher interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills, offset by lower dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense increased $4.8 million, or 9.2%, in 2019, due to higher interest paid on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts.\nInvestment Gains (Losses)\nInvestment gains (losses) consist primarily of realized and unrealized investment gains or losses on: (i) employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (ii) U.S. Treasury Bills, (iii) market-making in exchange-traded options and equities, (iv) seed capital investments, (v) derivatives and (vi) investments in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Investment gains (losses) also include equity in earnings of proprietary investments in limited partnership hedge funds that we sponsor and manage.\nInvestment gains (losses) are as follows:\n\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues consist of fees earned for transfer agency services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds, fees earned for administration and recordkeeping services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds and the general accounts of EQH and its subsidiaries, and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues increased $7.1 million, or 7.3%, in 2020, primarily due to higher shareholder servicing fees, higher brokerage income and higher mutual fund reimbursements, partially offset by lower investment income related to our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Other revenues decreased $1.1 million, or 1.1%, in 2019, primarily due to lower brokerage income and lower investment income related to our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds, partially offset by higher shareholder servicing fees.\nExpenses\nThe components of expenses are as follows:\n\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\nEmployee compensation and benefits consist of base compensation (including salaries and severance), annual short-term incentive compensation awards (cash bonuses), annual long-term incentive compensation awards, commissions, fringe benefits and other employment costs (including recruitment, training, temporary help and meals).\nCompensation expense as a percentage of net revenues was 40.3%, 41.0% and 40.9% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Compensation expense generally is determined on a discretionary basis and is primarily a function of our firm's current-year financial performance. The amounts of incentive compensation we award are designed to motivate, reward and retain top talent while aligning our executives' interests with the interests of our Unitholders. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of AllianceBernstein Corporation ( Compensation Committee\u201d), periodically confirms that the appropriate metric to consider in determining the amount of incentive compensation is the ratio of adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues. Adjusted net revenues used in the adjusted compensation ratio are the same as the adjusted net revenues presented as a non-GAAP measure (discussed earlier in this Item 7). Adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense is total employee compensation and benefits expense minus other employment costs such as recruitment, training, temporary help and meals (which were 0.9%, 1.2% and 1.1% of adjusted net revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively), and excludes the impact of mark-to-market vesting expense, as well as dividends and interest expense, associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments and the amortization expense associated with the awards issued by EQH to our firm's CEO relating to his role as a member of the EQH Management Committee. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee, has established as an objective that adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense generally should not exceed 50% of our adjusted net revenues, except in unexpected or unusual circumstances. Our ratios of adjusted compensation expense as a percentage of adjusted net revenues were 47.9%, 47.9% and 47.5%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIn 2020, employee compensation and benefits expense increased $51.4 million, or 3.6%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation of $58.8 million and higher base compensation of $13.5 million (primarily higher base salaries), offset by lower fringes of $8.5 million, lower commissions of $6.2 million and lower other employment costs of $6.2 million. In 2019, employee compensation and benefits expense increased $64.0 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to higher base compensation of $34.1 million (primarily higher salaries), higher incentive compensation of $17.4 million and higher fringes of $15.6 million, partially offset by lower commissions of $3.2 million.\nPromotion and Servicing\nPromotion and servicing expenses include distribution-related payments to financial intermediaries for distribution of AB mutual funds and amortization of deferred sales commissions paid to financial intermediaries for the sale of back-end load shares of AB mutual funds. Also included in this expense category are costs related to travel and entertainment, advertising and promotional materials.\nPromotion and servicing expenses increased $63.6 million, or 8.8%, in 2020. The increase primarily was due to higher distribution-related payments of $81.3 million, higher amortization of deferred sales commissions of $12.3 million, higher trade execution and clearance expenses of $7.9 million and higher transfer fees of $4.8 million, offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses of $34.3 million and lower marketing expenses of $8.4 million. The decrease in travel and entertainment and marketing expense is primarily a result of cost savings associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect these costs to increase in 2021 and further normalize in 2022, as the pandemic recedes. Promotion and servicing expenses increased $51.7 million, or 7.7%, in 2019. The increase primarily was due to higher distribution-related payments of $60.8 million and higher travel and entertainment expenses of $3.2 million, offset by lower amortization of deferred sales commissions of $6.3 million, lower trade execution and clearance expenses of $3.7 million and lower marketing expenses of $2.5 million.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include portfolio services expenses, technology expenses, professional fees and office-related expenses (occupancy, communications and similar expenses). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 13.2% (13.1% excluding real estate charges), 13.9% (13.8% excluding real estate charges) and 13.5% (13.3% excluding real estate charges) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $3.0 million, or 0.6%, during 2020, primarily due to higher technology fees of $4.7 million, higher charitable contributions of $3.9 million, higher portfolio service fees of $3.6 million, higher real estate charges of $2.2 million and higher other taxes of $1.6 million, partially offset by lower professional fees of $9.1 million and lower office-related expenses of $3.5 million. General and administrative expenses increased $31.9 million, or 7.0%, during 2019, primarily due to higher portfolio service fees of $11.2 million, higher technology fees of $11.0 million and higher professional fees of $7.0 million.\nContingent Payment Arrangements\nContingent payment arrangements reflect changes in estimates of contingent payment liabilities associated with acquisitions in previous periods, as well as accretion expense of these liabilities. The expense of $1.9 million for 2020 reflects accretion expense of $3.3 million, offset by the change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2016 acquisition of $1.4 million. The credit of $0.5 million for 2019 reflects the change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2016 acquisition of $3.1 million, offset by accretion expenses of $2.6 million. The credit of $2.2 million for 2018 reflects the change in estimate of the contingent consideration payable relating to our 2016 acquisition of $2.4 million, offset by accretion expenses of $0.2 million.\nInterest on Borrowings\nInterest expense decreased 52.6% in 2020, reflecting lower interest rates partially offset by higher weighted average borrowings. Average daily borrowings for both the EQH facility and commercial paper were $554.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 0.5% during 2020 compared to $436.9 million and 2.5% during 2019. Interest expense increased 25.8% in 2019, reflecting both higher weighted average borrowings and interest rates. Average daily borrowings for both the EQH facility and commercial paper were $436.9 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.5% during 2019 compared to $350.3 million and 2.0% for commercial paper during 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nAB, a private limited partnership, is not subject to federal or state corporate income taxes. However, AB is subject to a 4.0% New York City unincorporated business tax ( UBT\u201d). Our domestic corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income taxes, and generally are included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return. Separate state and local income tax returns also are filed. Foreign corporate subsidiaries generally are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions where they are located.\nIncome tax expense increased $3.9 million, or 9.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019. This increase is due to higher pre-tax book income, offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate in 2020 of 5.0% compared to 5.1% in 2019. The decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by a reduction of one-time discrete items.\nIncome tax expense decreased $4.1 million, or 8.9%, in 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease is due to a lower effective tax rate in 2019 of 5.1% compared to 5.6% in 2018. The decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by a more favorable mix of earnings across the AB tax filing groups and a reduction of one-time discrete items.\nNet Income (Loss) of Consolidated Entities Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\nNet income (loss) of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests primarily consists of limited partner interests owned by other investors in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2020, we had $4.2 million of net losses of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to losses on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2019 and 2018, we had $29.6 million and $21.9 million, respectively, of net gains of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to gains on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Fluctuations period-to-period result primarily from the number of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and their respective market performance.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nCash flows from operating activities primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and services fees and other revenues offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Our cash flows from operating activities have historically been positive and sufficient in supporting our operations. We do not anticipate this to change in the foreseeable future. Cash flows from investing activities generally consist of small capital expenditures and, when applicable, business acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities primarily consist of issuance and repayment of debt and the repurchase of AB Holding units to fund our long-term deferred compensation plans. We are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow to our Unitholders and the General Partner.\nDuring 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, compared to $827.5 million during 2019. The change primarily was due to net activity of our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $468.2 million, an increase in broker-dealer related payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity) of $368.0 million, a decrease in other assets of $92.3 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $67.2 million and an increase in accrued compensation of $54.4 million, partially offset by higher net purchases of broker-dealer investments of $454.1 million. During 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $827.5 million, compared to $1.3 billion during 2018. The change primarily was due to a decrease in broker-dealer related payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity) of $754.8 million and net activity of our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $427.6 million, offset by lower net purchases of broker-dealer investments of $754.7 million.\nDuring 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $59.1 million, compared to $23.0 million during 2019. The change is primarily due to $13.6 millions paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $4.1 million paid for equity method investments and higher purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements of $13.2 million. During 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $23.0 million, compared to $32.8 million during 2018. The change is primarily due to the acquisition of Autonomous, net of cash acquired, of $5.3 million.\nDuring 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion, compared to $775.0 million during 2019. The change reflects higher redemptions of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of $369.1 million and higher distributions to the General Partner and Unitholders of $133.4 million, partially offset by higher net proceeds of debt of $112.9 million and an increase in overdrafts payable of $47.3 million. During 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $775.0 million, compared to $1.6 billion during 2018. The change reflects the net purchases of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in 2019 as compared to net redemptions of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in 2018 (impact of $622.2 million), lower distributions to the General Partner and Unitholders of $154.7 million and lower net purchases of AB Holding Units to fund long-term incentive compensation plan awards of $95.5 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, AB had $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash and cash equivalents of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds), all of which is available for liquidity but consist primarily of cash on deposit for our broker-dealers related to various customer clearing activities, and cash held by foreign subsidiaries of $586.3 million.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nSee Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for disclosures relating to our debt and credit facilities.\nOur financial condition and access to public and private debt markets should provide adequate liquidity for our general business needs. Management believes that cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and AB Units or AB Holding Units will provide us with the resources we need to meet our financial obligations. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Item 7 for a discussion of credit markets and our ability to renew our credit facilities at expiration.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nGuarantees\nUnder various circumstances, AB guarantees the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAB maintains guarantees in connection with the Credit Facility (the \"Credit Facility\") and Revolver (the \"Revolver\"). If SCB LLC is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand. In addition, AB maintains guarantees totaling $365.0 million for SCB LLC's three uncommitted lines of credit.\nAB maintains a guarantee with a commercial bank, under which we guarantee the obligations in the ordinary course of business of each of SCB LLC, our U.K.-based broker-dealer and our Cayman subsidiary. We also maintain three additional guarantees with other commercial banks under which we guarantee approximately $294.7 million of obligations for our U.K.-based broker-dealer and $99.0 million of obligations for our India-based broker-dealer. In the event that any of these three entities is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand.\nWe also have two smaller guarantees with a commercial bank totaling approximately $2.1 million, under which we guarantee certain obligations in the ordinary course of business of one of our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe have not been required to perform under any of the above agreements and currently have no liability in connection with these agreements.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\n\nDuring 2010, as general partner of AllianceBernstein U.S. Real Estate L.P. ( Real Estate Fund\u201d), we committed to invest $25.0 million in the Real Estate Fund. As of December 31, 2020, we had funded $22.4 million of this commitment. During 2014, as general partner of AllianceBernstein U.S. Real Estate II L.P. ( Real Estate Fund II\u201d), we committed to invest $27.3 million, as amended in 2020, in the Real Estate Fund II. As of December 31, 2020, we had funded $20.8 million of this commitment.\nAccrued compensation and benefits amounts in the table above exclude our accrued pension obligation. Offsetting our accrued compensation obligations are long-term incentive compensation-related investments and money market investments we funded totaling $67.0 million, which are included in our consolidated statement of financial condition. Any amounts reflected on the\nconsolidated statement of financial condition as payables (to broker-dealers, brokerage clients and company-sponsored mutual funds) and accounts payable and accrued expenses (excluding the tax obligations above) are excluded from the table above.\nWe expect to make contributions to our qualified profit sharing plan of approximately $15 million in each of the next four years. We do not currently anticipate that we will contribute to the Retirement Plan during 2021.\nThe 2017 Tax Act (enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017) imposed a federal transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of certain deferred foreign earnings. Management elected to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight-year period from 2018 to 2025. The federal transition tax obligation is recorded to income tax payable on our consolidated statement of financial condition. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our taxes.\nDuring October 2018, we signed a lease, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020, relating to 218,976 square feet of space at our newly constructed Nashville headquarters. Our estimated total base rent obligation (excluding taxes, operating expenses and utilities) over the 15-year initial lease term is $134.0 million. During April 2019, we signed a lease, which commences in 2024, relating to approximately 190,000 square feet of newly constructed space in New York City. Our estimated total base rent obligation (excluding taxes, operating expenses and utilities) over the 20-year lease term is approximately $448.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we exercised an option to return a half floor of this space, which reduced our square footage from approximately 190,000 to 166,000 square feet and our base rent obligation from $448.0 million to $393.0 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion of our leases.\nSee Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our debt.\nContingencies\nSee Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\nManagement believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve significant management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used.\nGoodwill\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had goodwill of $3.1 billion on the consolidated statement of financial condition. We have determined that AB has only one reporting segment and reporting unit. We test our goodwill annually, as of September 30, for impairment. As of September 30, 2020, the impairment test indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The carrying value of goodwill is also reviewed if facts and circumstances occur that suggest possible impairment, such as significant declines in AUM, revenues, earnings or the price of an AB Holding Unit.\nOn an annual basis, or when circumstances warrant, goodwill is tested for impairment utilizing the market approach where the fair value of the reporting unit is based on its unadjusted market valuation (AB Units outstanding multiplied by AB Holding's Unit price) and earnings multiples. The price of a publicly-traded AB Holding Unit serves as a reasonable starting point for valuing an AB Unit because each represents the same fractional interest in our underlying business. Our market approach analysis also includes comparable industry earnings multiples applied to our earnings forecast and assumes a control premium (when applicable).\nThroughout the year, the carrying value of goodwill is also reviewed for impairment if certain events or changes in circumstances occur, and trigger whether an interim impairment test may be required. Such changes in circumstances may include, but are not limited to, a sustained decrease in the price of an AB Unit or declines in AB's market capitalization that would suggest that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount; significant and unanticipated declines in AB's assets under management or revenues; and/or lower than expected earnings per unit. Any of these changes in circumstances could suggest the possibility that goodwill is impaired, but none of these events or circumstances by itself would indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. Instead, they are merely recognized as triggering events for the consideration of impairment and must be viewed in combination with any mitigating or positive factors. A holistic evaluation of all events since the most recent quantitative impairment test must be done to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit is impaired.\nAs of January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The guidance removed Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which had required a hypothetical purchase price allocation. As a result of the revised guidance, a goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Under this guidance, the goodwill impairment test no longer includes a determination by management of whether a decline in fair value is temporary; however, it is important to consider the impact of changing market conditions, including the severity and anticipated duration, is reflected in management's determination of fair value.\nLoss Contingencies\nManagement continuously reviews with legal counsel the status of regulatory matters and pending or threatened litigation. We evaluate the likelihood that a loss contingency exists and record a loss contingency if it is both probable and reasonably estimable as of the date of the financial statements. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nCautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements provided by management in this report are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The most significant of these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: the performance of financial markets, the investment performance of sponsored investment products and separately-managed accounts, general economic conditions, industry trends, future acquisitions, integration of acquired companies, competitive conditions and government regulations, including changes in tax regulations and rates and the manner in which the earnings of publicly-traded partnerships are taxed. We caution readers to carefully consider such factors. Further, these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. For further information regarding these forward-looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ, see Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. Any or all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this Form 10-K, other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, and any other public statements we issue, may turn out to be wrong. It is important to remember that other factors besides those listed in Risk Factors\u201d and those listed below could also adversely impact our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nThe forward-looking statements referred to in the preceding paragraph, most of which directly affect AB but also affect AB Holding because AB Holding's principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB, include statements regarding:\n\u2022Our belief that the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB will provide AB Holding with the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations: AB Holding's cash flow is dependent on the quarterly cash distributions it receives from AB. Accordingly, AB Holding's ability to meet its financial obligations is dependent on AB's cash flow from its operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets and other factors beyond our control.\n\u2022Our financial condition and ability to access the public and private capital markets providing adequate liquidity for our general business needs: Our financial condition is dependent on our cash flow from operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets, our ability to maintain and grow client assets under management and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to access public and private capital markets on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, our firm's credit ratings, our profitability and changes in government regulations, including tax rates and interest rates.\n\u2022The outcome of litigation: Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive damage awards do occur. Though we have stated that we do not expect any pending legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, any settlement or judgment with respect to a legal proceeding could be significant, and could have such an effect.\n\u2022The possibility that we will engage in open market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program: The number of AB Holding Units AB may decide to buy in future periods, if any, to help fund incentive compensation awards depends on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the fluctuation in the price of an AB Holding Unit (NYSE: AB) and the availability of cash to make these purchases.\n\u2022Our determination that adjusted employee compensation expense should not exceed 50% of our adjusted net revenues: Aggregate employee compensation reflects employee performance and competitive compensation levels. Fluctuations in our revenues and/or changes in competitive compensation levels could result in adjusted employee compensation expense exceeding 50% of our adjusted net revenues.\n\u2022Our Relocation Strategy: While the expenses, expense savings and EPU impact we expect will result from our Relocation Strategy are presented with numerical specificity, and we believe these figures to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions on which our estimates are based create a significant risk that our current estimates may not be realized. These assumptions include:\n\u2022the amount and timing of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs we experience; and\n\u2022the timing for execution of each phase of our relocation implementation plan.\n\u2022The Adverse Impact of COVID-19: The severity of the expected adverse impact on our AUM and revenues of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on the depth and length of the downturn and its impact on the companies in which we invest. Our conclusions about the possible continuing significant adverse impact on us is based on our assumptions that the recovery will be gradual and that there will be lasting high unemployment and economic damage.

the COVID-19 pandemic. Key highlights include:\n\n- COVID-19 substantially impacted global economies beginning in Q1 2020, with effects persisting through Q4 2020.\n- Businesses faced operational interruptions, employee layoffs, repeated closures, and demand reductions.\n- Financial markets experienced volatility, but markets recovered from initial declines.\n- Government fiscal stimuli aimed to stabilize economies, though the timing and magnitude of economic recovery remain uncertain.\n- AB implemented continuity measures, including remote work, travel restrictions, and health and safety protocols.\n- The firm enhanced technology to support effective remote work and focused on employee well-being.\n- AB's asset management depends on financial market performance, which rebounded in the latter half of the year, primarily due to government stimulus.\n- Despite 2020 challenges, including the pandemic and a tense U.S. presidential election, equity markets closed with solid gains.\n- MiFID II in Europe impacts how European broker-dealers can compensate for research, potentially reducing AB's revenue from European clients.\n- The future relationship between China and the U.S. remains uncertain.\n- The relocation of AB's corporate headquarters to Nashville is expected to afford cost savings and an improved quality of life for employees.\n- AB Holding's net income increased due to factors like higher base advisory fees, higher performance-based fees, and the inclusion of Autonomous Research revenues.\n\nThe outlook for AB is cautious due to ongoing economic uncertainties, market volatility, regulatory changes like MiFID II, and the completion of strategic initiatives such as the Nashville relocation. While AB expects its corporate actions and the broad vaccine application to return business to normal, the timeline remains unclear. \n\nIt's important to note that \"AB\" refers to AllianceBernstein L.P. and also to AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. (\"AB Holding\"). The report contains forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Statements consider the performance of financial markets, the investment performance of AB's products, broad economic conditions, competitive conditions, changes in tax rates and regulations, and other factors."}
