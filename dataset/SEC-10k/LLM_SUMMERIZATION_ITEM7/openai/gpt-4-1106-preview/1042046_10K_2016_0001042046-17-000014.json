This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page.\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial Condition\nAFG is organized as a holding company with almost all of its operations being conducted by subsidiaries. AFG, however, has continuing cash needs for administrative expenses, the payment of principal and interest on borrowings, shareholder dividends, and taxes. Therefore, certain analyses are most meaningfully presented on a parent only basis while others are best done on a total enterprise basis. In addition, because most of its businesses are financial in nature, AFG does not prepare its consolidated financial statements using a current-noncurrent format. Consequently, certain traditional ratios and financial analysis tests are not meaningful.\nAt December 31, 2016, AFG (parent) held approximately $260 million in cash and securities and had $500 million available under a bank line of credit, which expires in June 2021.\nResults of Operations\nThrough the operations of its subsidiaries, AFG is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance, focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses, and in the sale of fixed and fixed-indexed annuities in the retail, financial institutions and education markets.\nFourth quarter 2016 net earnings attributable to AFG's shareholders were $385 million ($4.33 per share, diluted) compared to $129 million ($1.45 per share, diluted) in the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher underwriting profit and net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher earnings in the annuity segment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fourth quarter 2016 tax benefits from the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>net realized gains on securities in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFull year 2016 net earnings attributable to AFG's shareholders were $649 million ($7.33 per share, diluted) compared to $352 million ($3.94 per share, diluted) in 2015, reflecting:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher underwriting profit and net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher earnings in the annuity segment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>lower profitability in the run-off long-term care and life segment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>net realized gains on securities in 2016 compared to net realized losses on securities in 2015,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the 2015 loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care business,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of an apartment property, which was less than the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of a hotel and the fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fourth quarter 2016 tax benefits related to the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSignificant accounting policies are summarized in Note A - Accounting Policies\u201d to the financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements. As more information becomes known, these estimates and assumptions change and, thus, impact amounts reported in the future. The areas where management believes the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements is most significant are as follows:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the establishment of insurance reserves, especially asbestos and environmental-related reserves,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the recoverability of reinsurance,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the establishment of asbestos and environmental reserves of former railroad and manufacturing operations, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the valuation of investments, including the determination of other-than-temporary impairments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Uncertainties\u201d for a discussion of insurance reserves, recoverables from reinsurers, and contingencies related to American Premier's former operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investments\u201d for a discussion of impairments on investments. Deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) and certain liabilities related to annuities are amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies. Assumptions considered in determining expected gross profits involve significant judgment and include management's estimates of interest rates and investment spreads, surrenders, annuitizations, renewal premiums and mortality. Should actual experience require management to change its assumptions (commonly referred to as unlocking\u201d), a charge or credit would be recorded to adjust DPAC or annuity liabilities to the levels they would have been if the new assumptions had been used from the inception date of each policy.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRatios AFG's debt to total capital ratio on a consolidated basis is shown below (dollars in millions). Management intends to maintain the ratio of debt to capital at or below 25% and intends to maintain the capital of its significant insurance subsidiaries at or above levels currently indicated by rating agencies as appropriate for the current ratings. Table 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal amount of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of debt to total capital:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Including subordinated debt and debt secured by real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excluding subordinated debt and debt secured by real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ratio of debt to total capital is a non-GAAP measure that management believes is useful for investors, analysts and independent ratings agencies to evaluate AFG's financial strength and liquidity and to provide insight into how AFG finances its operations. In addition, maintaining a ratio of debt, excluding subordinated debt and debt secured by real estate, to total capital of 35% or lower is a financial covenant in AFG's bank credit facility. The ratio is calculated by dividing the principal amount of AFG's long-term debt by its total capital, which includes long-term debt, noncontrolling interests and shareholders' equity (excluding unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity investments).\nAFG's ratio of earnings to fixed charges, including annuity benefits as a fixed charge, was 1.85 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding annuity benefits, this ratio was 8.62. Although the ratio excluding annuity benefits is not required or encouraged to be disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, it is presented because interest credited to annuity policyholder accounts is not always considered a borrowing cost for an insurance company.\nThe NAIC's model law for risk based capital ( RBC\u201d) applies to both life and property and casualty companies. RBC formulas determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs so that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired. At December 31, 2016, the capital ratios of all AFG insurance companies substantially exceeded the RBC requirements.\nCondensed Consolidated Cash Flows AFG's principal sources of cash include insurance premiums, income from its investment portfolio and proceeds from the maturities, redemptions and sales of investments. Insurance premiums in excess of acquisition expenses and operating costs are invested until they are needed to meet policyholder obligations or made available to the parent company through dividends to cover debt obligations and corporate expenses, and to provide returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as detailed in AFG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are shown below (in millions):\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(2,981\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,628\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>2,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities AFG's property and casualty insurance operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as premiums collected and investment income exceed policy acquisition costs, claims payments and operating expenses. AFG's net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by the level and timing of property and casualty premiums, claim and expense payments and recoveries from reinsurers. AFG's annuity operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as investment income exceeds acquisition costs and operating expenses. Interest credited on annuity policyholder funds is a non-cash increase in AFG's annuity benefits accumulated liability and annuity premiums, benefits and withdrawals are considered financing activities due to the deposit-type nature of annuities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.15 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.23 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities AFG's investing activities consist primarily of the investment of funds provided by its property and casualty and annuity products. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.98 billion in 2016 compared to $4.57 billion in 2015, a decrease of $1.59 billion. The $151 million decrease in net cash flows from annuity policyholders in 2016 as compared to 2015 (discussed below under net cash provided by financing activities) decreased the amount of cash available for investment in 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, AFG's cash on hand increased by $887 million during 2016, primarily in the property and casualty and annuity segments reflecting the timing of investing available cash in those segments. Investing activities also include the purchase and disposal of managed investment entity investments (collateralized loan obligations), which are presented separately in AFG's Balance Sheet. Net investment activity in the managed investment entities was a $364 million use of cash in 2016 compared to a $675 million use of cash in 2015, accounting for a $311 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $4.57 billion in 2015 compared to $3.63 billion in 2014, an increase of $945 million. The $537 million increase in net cash flows from annuity policyholders in 2015 as compared to 2014 increased the amount of cash available for investment in 2015 compared to 2014. Net investment activity in the managed investment entities was a $675 million use of cash in 2015 compared to a $275 million use of cash in 2014, accounting for a $400 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities AFG's financing activities consist primarily of transactions with annuity policyholders, issuances and retirements of long-term debt, repurchases of common stock and dividend payments. Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.72 billion in 2016 compared to $3.10 billion in 2015, a decrease of $379 million. Annuity receipts exceeded annuity surrenders, benefits, withdrawals and transfers by $2.35 billion in 2016 compared to $2.50 billion in 2015, resulting in a $151 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. AFG issued $300 million of 3.50% Senior Notes in 2016 and $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures in 2015, the\nnet proceeds of which contributed $296 million in 2016 and $145 million in 2015 to net cash provided by financing activities. Redemptions of long-term debt was an $18 million use of cash in 2016 and a $192 million use of cash in 2015. During 2016, AFG repurchased $133 million of its Common Stock compared to $126 million repurchased in 2015, which accounted for a $7 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2016, $315 million was used to fund the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in National Interstate Corporation. Financing activities also include issuances and retirements of managed investment entity liabilities, which are nonrecourse to AFG and presented separately in AFG's Balance Sheet. Issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $693 million in 2016 compared to $890 million in 2015, accounting for a $197 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3.10 billion in 2015 compared to $2.10 billion in 2014, an increase of $996 million. Annuity receipts exceeded annuity surrenders, benefits, withdrawals and transfers by $2.50 billion in 2015 compared to $1.97 billion in 2014, resulting in a $537 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities. Redemptions of long-term debt resulted in a $192 million use of cash in 2015. AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures in 2015 and $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures in 2014, the net proceeds of each issuance contributed $145 million to net cash provided by financing activities in those years. During 2015, AFG repurchased $126 million of its Common Stock compared to $191 million in 2014, which accounted for a $65 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014. Issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $890 million in 2015 compared to $306 million in 2014, accounting for a $584 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014.\nParent and Subsidiary Liquidity\nParent Holding Company Liquidity Management believes AFG has sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements. If funds generated from operations, including dividends, tax payments and borrowings from subsidiaries, are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period, AFG would be required to utilize parent company cash and marketable securities or to generate cash through borrowings, sales of other assets, or similar transactions.\nIn June 2016, AFG replaced its bank credit facility with a five-year, $500 million revolving credit line. Amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at rates ranging from 1.00% to 1.875% (currently 1.375%) over LIBOR based on AFG's credit rating. There were no borrowings under this agreement, or under any other parent company short-term borrowing arrangements, during 2016.\nOn November 10, 2016, AFG acquired the 49% of National Interstate Corporation ( NATL\u201d) not previously owned by AFG's wholly-owned subsidiary, Great American Insurance Company ( GAI\u201d) for $315 million ($32.00 per share) in cash in a merger transaction. In addition, NATL paid a one-time special cash dividend of $0.50 per share to its shareholders immediately prior to the merger closing ($5 million was paid to noncontrolling shareholders). See Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements.\nIn August 2016, AFG issued $300 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due 2026. AFG used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the acquisition of NATL mentioned above.\nDuring 2016, AFG repurchased 1.9 million shares of its Common Stock for $133 million. In December 2016, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $87 million.\nIn November 2015, AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures due 2055. In September 2015, AFG redeemed its $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050 at par using cash on hand at the parent company.\nDuring 2015, AFG repurchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock for $126 million. In December 2015, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million.\nIn April 2014, AFG completed the purchase of Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and its related companies ( Summit\u201d) from Liberty Mutual Insurance for $259 million using cash on hand at the parent company. In addition, AFG made a capital contribution of approximately $140 million, bringing its capital investment in the Summit business to $399 million. Summit's results of operations are included in AFG's consolidated results beginning in April of 2014.\nIn September 2014, AFG issued $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures due 2054. During 2014, AFG repurchased 3.3 million shares of its Common Stock for $191 million. In December 2014, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million.\nAll debentures and notes issued by AFG are rated investment grade by two nationally recognized rating agencies. Under a currently effective shelf registration statement, AFG can offer additional equity or debt securities. The shelf registration provides AFG with flexibility to access the capital markets from time to time as market and other conditions permit.\nUnder a tax allocation agreement with AFG, its 80%-owned U.S. subsidiaries generally pay taxes to (or recover taxes from) AFG based on each subsidiary's contribution to amounts due under AFG's consolidated tax return.\nSubsidiary Liquidity Great American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC\u201d), a wholly-owned annuity subsidiary, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati ( FHLB\u201d). The FHLB makes advances and provides other banking services to member institutions, which provides the annuity operations with an additional source of liquidity. These advances further the FHLB's mission of improving access to housing by increasing liquidity in the residential mortgage-backed securities market. At December 31, 2016, GALIC had $935 million in outstanding advances from the FHLB (included in annuity benefits accumulated), bearing interest at rates ranging from 0.03% to 0.53% over LIBOR (average rate of 1.18% at December 31, 2016). In the fourth quarter of 2016, GALIC extended the terms on advances totaling $200 million by four years. While these advances must be repaid between 2018 and 2021 ($285 million in 2018, $500 million in 2020 and $150 million in 2021), GALIC has the option to prepay all or a portion of the advances. GALIC has invested the proceeds from the advances in fixed maturity securities with similar expected lives as the advances for the purpose of earning a spread over the interest payments due to the FHLB. At December 31, 2016, GALIC estimated that it had additional borrowing capacity of approximately $300 million from the FHLB.\nThe liquidity requirements of AFG's insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and expenses, payments of dividends and taxes to AFG and contributions of capital to their subsidiaries. Historically, cash flows from premiums and investment income have generally provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements. Funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities. In addition, the insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid, short-term investments.\nThe excess cash flow of AFG's property and casualty group allows it to extend the duration of its investment portfolio somewhat beyond that of its claim reserves.\nIn the annuity business, where profitability is largely dependent on earning a spread between invested assets and annuity liabilities, the duration of investments is generally maintained close to that of liabilities. In a rising interest rate environment, significant protection from withdrawals exists in the form of temporary and permanent surrender charges on AFG's annuity products. With declining rates, AFG receives some protection (from spread compression) due to the ability to lower crediting rates, subject to contractually guaranteed minimum interest rates ( GMIRs\u201d). AFG began selling policies with GMIRs below 2% in 2003; almost all new business since late 2010 has been issued with a 1% GMIR. At December 31, 2016, AFG could reduce the average crediting rate on approximately $22 billion of traditional fixed and fixed-indexed annuities without guaranteed withdrawal benefits by approximately 80 basis points (on a weighted average basis). Annuity policies are subject to GMIRs at policy issuance. The table below shows the breakdown of annuity reserves by GMIR. The current interest crediting rates on substantially all of AFG's annuities with a GMIR of 3% or higher are at their minimum.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>at December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>GMIR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>1 - 1.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2 - 2.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>3 - 3.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>4.00% and above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Annuity benefits accumulated (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$29,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG's weighted average cost of funds for newly issued traditional fixed and fixed-indexed annuities was 2.28% for 2016 compared to 2.31% for 2015. In the first half of 2016, AFG lowered the crediting rates on new annuity sales due to the decline in market investment yields experienced during that period. Conversely, AFG raised crediting rates on new annuity sales in the\nlatter part of 2016 in response to rising market investment yields. In addition to lowering the cost of funds, AFG reduced certain commission rates and guaranteed withdrawal benefits on annuities sold in 2016.\nFor statutory accounting purposes, equity securities of non-affiliates and equity call options used in the fixed-indexed annuity business are generally carried at fair value. At December 31, 2016, AFG's insurance companies owned publicly traded equity securities with a fair value of $1.51 billion and equity call options with a fair value of $492 million. Decreases in market prices could adversely affect the insurance group's capital, potentially impacting the amount of dividends available or necessitating a capital contribution. Conversely, increases in market prices could have a favorable impact on the group's dividend-paying capability.\nAFG believes its insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and benefits and operating expenses. In addition, these subsidiaries have sufficient capital to meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies, inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies. Nonetheless, changes in statutory accounting rules, significant declines in the fair value of the insurance subsidiaries' investment portfolios or significant ratings downgrades on these investments, could create a need for additional capital.\nCondensed Parent Only Cash Flows AFG's parent holding company only condensed cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are shown below (in millions):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(560\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(232\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(231\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nParent Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Parent holding company cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of dividends and tax payments received from AFG's insurance subsidiaries, reduced by tax payments to the IRS and holding company interest and other expenses. Parent holding company net cash provided by operating activities was $555 million in 2016 compared to $162 million in 2015 and $372 million in 2014. Higher dividends received from subsidiaries in 2016 as compared to 2015 were the primary driver of the $393 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities. The $210 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily the result of lower dividends received.\nParent Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Parent holding company investing activities consist of capital contributions to and returns of capital from subsidiaries and, to a much lesser extent, parent company investment activity. Parent holding company net cash used in investing activities was $560 million in 2016 compared to $33 million in 2015 and $432 million in 2014. The $560 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 as compared to the $33 million in 2015 is significantly higher due primarily to increased capital contributions to a subsidiary to fund the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in National Interstate Corporation. The $33 million of parent holding company net cash used in investing activities in 2015 was significantly lower than the $432 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 due primarily to capital contributions made to a subsidiary to fund the $399 million investment in Summit in 2014.\nParent Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Parent company financing activities consist primarily of repurchases of AFG Common Stock, dividends to shareholders, the issuance and retirement of long-term debt and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Significant long-term debt and common stock transactions are discussed above under Parent Holding Company Liquidity.\u201d Parent holding company net cash provided by financing activities was $13 million in 2016 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $232 million in 2015 and $171 million in 2014. The $245 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflects proceeds from additional long-term borrowings. The $61 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 reflects the 2015 redemption of $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050, partially offset by a $65 million decrease in common stock repurchases.\nContractual Obligations The following table shows an estimate (based on historical patterns and expected trends) of payments to be made for insurance reserve liabilities, as well as scheduled payments for major contractual obligations (in millions).

In addition, $359 million in fixed maturities and $56 million in equity securities were classified as trading with changes in unrealized holding gains or losses included in net investment income.\nAs detailed in Note E - Investments - Net Unrealized Gain on Marketable Securities\u201d to the financial statements, unrealized gains and losses on AFG's fixed maturity and equity securities are included in shareholders' equity after adjustments for related changes in DPAC and certain liabilities related to annuity, long-term care and life businesses, noncontrolling interests and deferred income taxes. DPAC and certain other balance sheet amounts applicable to annuity, long-term care and life businesses are adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses had been realized, with corresponding increases or decreases (net of tax) included in accumulated other comprehensive income in AFG's Balance Sheet.\nFixed income investment funds are generally invested in securities with intermediate-term maturities with an objective of optimizing total return while allowing flexibility to react to changes in market conditions. At December 31, 2016, the average life of AFG's fixed maturities was about 6-1/2 years.\nFair values for AFG's portfolio are determined by AFG's internal investment professionals using data from nationally recognized pricing services as well as non-binding broker quotes. Fair values of equity securities are generally based on published closing prices. For mortgage-backed securities ( MBS\u201d), which comprise approximately 15% of AFG's fixed maturities, prices for each security are generally obtained from both pricing services and broker quotes. For the remainder of AFG's fixed maturity portfolio, approximately 79% are priced using pricing services and the balance is priced primarily by\nusing non-binding broker quotes. When prices obtained for the same security vary, AFG's internal investment professionals select the price they believe is most indicative of an exit price.\nThe pricing services use a variety of observable inputs to estimate fair value of fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis. Based upon information provided by the pricing services, these inputs include, but are not limited to, recent reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids or offers, reference data, and measures of volatility. Included in the pricing of MBS are estimates of the rate of future prepayments and defaults of principal over the remaining life of the underlying collateral. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on brokers' prices are classified as Level 3 in the GAAP hierarchy unless the price can be corroborated, for example, by comparison to similar securities priced using observable inputs.\nValuation techniques utilized by pricing services and prices obtained from external sources are reviewed by AFG's internal investment professionals who are familiar with the securities being priced and the markets in which they trade to ensure the fair value determination is representative of an exit price. To validate the appropriateness of the prices obtained, these investment managers consider widely published indices (as benchmarks), recent trades, changes in interest rates, general economic conditions and the credit quality of the specific issuers. In addition, AFG communicates directly with pricing services regarding the methods and assumptions used in pricing, including verifying, on a test basis, the inputs used by the services to value specific securities.\nIn general, the fair value of AFG's fixed maturity investments is inversely correlated to changes in interest rates. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of such fair values to reasonably likely changes in interest rates by illustrating the estimated effect on AFG's fixed maturity portfolio and accumulated other comprehensive income that an immediate increase of 100 basis points in the interest rate yield curve would have at December 31, 2016 (dollars in millions). Effects of increases or decreases from the 100 basis points illustrated would be approximately proportional.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of fixed maturity portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage impact on fair value of 100 bps increase in interest rates\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pretax impact on fair value of fixed maturity portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,745\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offsetting adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs and other balance sheet amounts\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated pretax impact on accumulated other comprehensive income\n</td> <td>(1,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated after-tax impact on accumulated other comprehensive income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(679\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nApproximately 89% of the fixed maturities held by AFG at December 31, 2016, were rated investment grade\u201d (credit rating of AAA to BBB) by nationally recognized rating agencies. Investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated and non-investment grade. Management believes that the high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return.\nMBS are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that, in periods of declining interest rates, mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates. Although interest rates have been low in recent years, tighter lending standards have resulted in fewer buyers being able to refinance the mortgages underlying much of AFG's non-agency residential MBS portfolio.\nSummarized information for AFG's MBS (including those classified as trading) at December 31, 2016, is shown in the table below (dollars in millions). Agency-backed securities are those issued by a U.S. government-backed agency; Alt-A mortgages are those with risk profiles between prime and subprime. The average life of the residential and commercial MBS is approximately 4-1/2 years and 4 years, respectively.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value as\n% of Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unrealized\nGain (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Rated\nInvestment\nGrade\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateral type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency-backed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-agency prime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alt-A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subprime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC\u201d) assigns creditworthiness designations on a scale of 1 to 6 with 1 being the highest quality and 6 being the lowest quality. The NAIC retains third-party investment management firms to assist in the determination of appropriate NAIC designations for mortgage-backed securities based not only on the probability of loss (which is the primary basis of ratings by the major ratings firms), but also on the severity of loss and statutory carrying value. At December 31, 2016, 97% (based on statutory carrying value of $4.75 billion) of AFG's MBS had an NAIC designation of 1.\nMunicipal bonds represented approximately 19% of AFG's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2016. AFG's municipal bond portfolio is high quality, with 98% of the securities rated investment grade at that date. The portfolio is well diversified across the states of issuance and individual issuers. At December 31, 2016, approximately 76% of the municipal bond portfolio was held in revenue bonds, with the remaining 24% held in general obligation bonds. General obligation securities of California, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Puerto Rico collectively represented approximately 1% of this portfolio.\nSummarized information for the unrealized gains and losses recorded in AFG's Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016, is shown in the following table (dollars in millions).

a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, a provision for impairment is charged to earnings (accounted for as a realized loss) and the cost basis of

Although AFG has the ability to continue holding its investments with unrealized losses, its intent to hold them may change due to deterioration in the issuers' creditworthiness, decisions to lessen exposure to a particular issuer or industry, asset/liability management decisions, market movements, changes in views about appropriate asset allocation or the desire to offset taxable realized gains. Should AFG's ability or intent change with regard to a particular security, a charge for impairment would likely be required. While it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired, charges for other-than-temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in future periods. Significant declines in the fair value of AFG's investment portfolio could have a significant adverse effect on AFG's liquidity. For information on AFG's realized gains (losses) on securities, including charges for other-than-temporary impairment, see Results of Operations - Consolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities.\u201d\nUncertainties As more fully explained in the following paragraphs, management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and contingencies arising out of its former railroad and manufacturing operations.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves Estimating the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors that are subject to significant variation. Determining the liability is a complex process incorporating input from many areas of the Company including actuarial, underwriting, pricing, claims and operations management.\nThe estimates of liabilities for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based upon: (i) the accumulation of case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting periods on direct business written ( case reserves\u201d); (ii) estimates received from ceding reinsurers and insurance pools and associations; (iii) estimates of claims incurred but not reported or IBNR\u201d (including possible development on known claims); (iv) estimates (based on experience) of expense for investigating and adjusting claims; and (v) the current state of law and coverage litigation.\nThe process used to determine the total reserve for liabilities involves estimating the ultimate incurred losses and LAE, adjusted for amounts already paid on the claims. The IBNR reserve is derived by first estimating the ultimate unpaid reserve liability and subtracting case reserves for loss and LAE. See Note O - Insurance - Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of the factors considered and actuarial methods used in determining management's best estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and LAE.\nThe following table shows (in millions) the breakdown of AFG's property and casualty reserves between case reserves, IBNR reserves and LAE reserves (estimated amounts required to adjust, record and settle claims, other than the claim payments themselves).\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Loss Reserves at December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Case\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IBNR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nReserve\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statutory Line of Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liability - occurrence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liability - claims made\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>576\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial auto/truck liability/medical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special property (fire, allied lines, inland marine, earthquake)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Products liability - occurrence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial multi-peril\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Statutory Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments for GAAP:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves of foreign operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>801\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred gains on retroactive reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss reserve discounting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Adjustments for GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total GAAP Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile current factors and reasonably likely changes in variable factors are considered in estimating the liability for unpaid losses, there is no method or system that can eliminate the risk of actual ultimate results differing from such estimates.\nFollowing is a discussion of certain critical variables affecting the estimation of loss reserves of the more significant long-tail lines of business (asbestos and environmental liabilities are separately discussed below). Many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs.\nAn important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future. However, future results could vary due to an unexpected change in the underlying cost trends. This unexpected change could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation, inflation from social programs, new medical technologies, or other factors such as those listed below in connection with AFG's largest lines of business. It is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these variables, and future cost trends could be partially impacted by several such variables. However, it is reasonable to address the sensitivity of the reserves to potential impact from changes in these variables by measuring the effect of a possible overall 1% change in future cost trends that may be caused by one or more variables. Utilizing the effect of a 1% change in overall cost trends enables changes greater than 1% to be estimated by extrapolation. Each additional 1% change in the cost trend would increase the effect on net earnings by an amount slightly (about 5%) greater than the effect of the previous 1%. For example, if a 1% change in cost trends in a line of business would change net earnings by $20 million, a 2% change would change net earnings by approximately $41 million.\nThe estimated cumulative impact that a 1% change in cost trends in AFG's more significant lines of property and casualty business (exceeding 5% of total reserves) would have on net earnings is shown below (in millions).

The following table shows (dollars in millions) what the impact on AFG's net earnings would be on the more significant lines of business if the December 31, 2016, reserves (net of reinsurance) developed at the same rate as the average development of the most recent five years.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5-yr.

Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for workers' compensation include:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Legislative actions and regulatory and legal interpretations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Future medical cost inflation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Economic conditions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Timing of claims reporting\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Medical advances and changes to life expectancies\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn April 2014, AFG acquired Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and related companies, a leading provider of workers' compensation solutions in the southeastern United States. The Summit acquisition significantly increased AFG's volume of workers' compensation business and improved its geographic diversity. Approximately 24% and 18% of AFG's workers' compensation reserves at December 31, 2016 relate to policies written in Florida and California, respectively. Over the past 13 years in both states, there have been numerous revisions to workers' compensation regulations and operating environments, adding difficulty and uncertainty to the estimation of related liabilities.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $85 million in 2016 due to lower than anticipated claim severity and improving claim closure rates. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $45 million in 2015 due to lower than anticipated claim severity across all regions of the country. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in 2014, as favorable reserve development in the business written in California was partially offset by adverse reserve development in other states.\nOther Liability - Occurrence\nThis long-tail line of business consists of coverages protecting the insured against legal liability resulting from negligence, carelessness, or a failure to act causing property damage or personal injury to others. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability - occurrence include:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Litigious climate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Magnitude of jury awards\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Outside counsel costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Timing of claims reporting\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $61 million in 2016 related to its other liability - occurrence coverage due primarily to increased severity in New York contractor claims. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in 2015 and $15 million in 2014 as both the frequency and severity of claims in excess and umbrella liability coverages were lower than previously projected.\nWhile management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above, more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held. For recent accident years, more weight is given to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.\nCommercial Auto/Truck Liability/Medical\nThis line of business is a mix of coverage protecting the insured against legal liability for property damage or personal injury to others arising from the operation of commercial motor vehicles. The property damage liability exposure is usually short-tail with relatively quick reporting and settlement of claims. The bodily injury and medical payments exposures are longer-tailed; although the claim reporting is relatively quick, the final settlement can take longer to achieve. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto/truck liability/medical are similar to other liability - occurrence and include:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Magnitude of jury awards\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Litigious climate and trends\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Change in frequency of severe accidents\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Health care costs and utilization of medical services by injured parties\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $28 million in 2016, $20 million in 2015 and $28 million in 2014 for this line of business as claim severity has been significantly higher than expected in accident years 2010 and subsequent.\nOther Liability - Claims Made\nThis long-tail line of business consists mostly of directors' and officers' liability ( D&O\u201d). Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability - claims made include:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Litigious climate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Economic conditions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Variability of stock prices\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Magnitude of jury awards\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe general state of the economy and the variability of the stock price of the insured can affect the frequency and severity of shareholder class action suits and other situations that trigger coverage under D&O policies. For example, from 2008 to 2010, economic conditions led to higher frequency of claims, particularly in the D&O policies for small account and not-for-profit organizations. Since then, claim frequency has continually decreased from its peak in 2010, offsetting increased claim severity.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $24 million in 2016, $12 million in 2015 and $18 million in 2014 on its D&O business as claim severity was less than expected across several prior accident years.\nReserves of Foreign Operations\nReserves of foreign operations relate primarily to the operations of Neon Underwriting Limited ( Neon\u201d), AFG's wholly-owned United Kingdom-based Lloyd's insurer. Historically, the largest line of business written by Neon was non-U.S. medical malpractice, which provides coverage for injuries and damages caused by medical care providers, including but not limited to, hospitals and their physicians. Although Neon offered this product in approximately 30 countries, the majority of the business has been written in the United Kingdom, Australia and Italy. In addition, Neon writes marine, equine, professional indemnity, directors and officers liability, catastrophe and cyber insurance and previously offered general liability policies. Significant variables in estimating the loss reserves include:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Litigious environment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Magnitude of court awards\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A slow moving judicial system including varying approaches to medical malpractice claims among courts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Trends in claim costs, including medical cost inflation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, Neon completed a strategic review of its business under a new leadership team. As part of its strategic review, Neon sold and/or exited certain historical lines of business including its medical malpractice and general liability classes. As a result of Neon's claims review of its exited lines of business, AFG recorded a charge of approximately $65 million, including $57 million to increase loss reserves (adverse development) primarily related to its medical malpractice and general liability lines. In addition to the exited lines charge, Neon recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $21 million in 2016, $44 million in 2015 and $14 million in 2014. The adverse development in 2016 outside of the exited lines charge was attributable to reserve strengthening in several lines of business, including political risk and personal accident. The adverse development in 2015 and 2014 was attributable to reserve strengthening in several lines of business, primarily Dutch hospital medical malpractice, Australian and other general liability and personal accident insurance.\nRecoverables from Reinsurers and Availability of Reinsurance AFG is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers, as reinsurance contracts do not relieve AFG of its liability to policyholders. To mitigate this risk, substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade S&P ratings or is secured by funds withheld\u201d or other collateral.\nThe availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, which are beyond AFG's control and which may affect AFG's level of business and profitability. Although the cost of certain reinsurance programs may increase, management believes that AFG will be able to maintain adequate reinsurance coverage at acceptable rates without a material adverse effect on AFG's results of operations. AFG's gross and net combined ratios are shown in the table below.\nSee Item 1 - Business - Property and Casualty Insurance Segment - Reinsurance\u201d for more information on AFG's reinsurance programs. For additional information on the effect of reinsurance on AFG's historical results of operations see Note O - Insurance - Reinsurance\u201d to the financial statements.\nThe following table illustrates the effect that purchasing property and casualty reinsurance has had on AFG's combined ratio over the last three years.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Before reinsurance (gross)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual (net of reinsurance)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutside of its property and casualty operations, AFG also has reinsurance recoverables totaling $343 million, including $296 million related to the run-off life business.

Environmental reserves include claims relating to polluted sites.\nAsbestos claims against manufacturers, distributors or installers of asbestos products were presented under the products liability section of their policies, which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer's liability. In recent years, a number of asbestos claims are being presented as non-products\u201d claims, such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property, under the premises or operations section of their policies. Unlike products exposures, these non-products exposures typically had no aggregate limits, creating potentially greater exposure for insurers. Further, in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage, some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non-products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non-products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits. AFG, along with other insurers, is and will be subject to such non-products claims. It is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non-products coverage or whether AFG and other insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses. Therefore, the future impact of such efforts is uncertain.\nApproximately 41% of AFG's net asbestos reserves relate to policies written directly by AFG subsidiaries. Claims from these policies generally are product-oriented claims with only a limited amount of non-products exposures, and are dominated by small to mid-sized commercial entities that are mostly regional policyholders with few national target defendants. The remainder is assumed reinsurance business that includes exposures for the periods 1954 to 1983. The asbestos and environmental assumed claims are ceded by various insurance companies under reinsurance treaties. A majority of the individual assumed claims have exposures of less than $100,000 to AFG. Asbestos losses assumed include some of the industry known manufacturers, distributors and installers. Pollution losses include industry known insured names and sites.\nEstablishing reserves for A&E claims relating to policies and participations in reinsurance treaties and former operations is subject to uncertainties that are significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims. For this group of claims, traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical loss development trends cannot be used and a range of reasonably possible losses cannot be estimated. Case reserves and expense reserves are established by the claims department as specific policies are identified. In addition to the case reserves established for known claims, management establishes additional reserves for claims not yet known or reported and for possible development on known claims. These additional reserves are management's best estimate based on periodic comprehensive studies and internal reviews adjusted for payments and identifiable changes, supplemented by management's review of industry information about such claims, with due consideration to individual claim situations.\nManagement believes that estimating the ultimate liability for asbestos claims presents a unique and difficult challenge to the insurance industry due to, among other things, inconsistent court decisions, an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos-related liabilities, novel theories of coverage, and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage. The casualty insurance industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues as the volume and severity of claims against asbestos defendants continue to increase. Environmental claims likewise present challenges in prediction, due to uncertainty regarding the interpretation of insurance policies, complexities regarding multi-party involvements at sites, evolving cleanup standards and protracted time periods required to assess the level of cleanup required at contaminated sites.\nThe following factors could impact AFG's reserves and payments:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>There is a growing interest at the state level to attempt to legislatively address asbestos liabilities and the manner in which asbestos claims are resolved.

A 1% variation in loss cost trends, caused by any of the factors previously described, would change net income by approximately $20 million.\nAFG tracks its A&E claims by policyholder. The following table shows, by type of claim, the number of policyholders that did not receive any payments in the calendar year separate from policyholders that did receive a payment.

This ratio is typically calculated by dividing reserves for A&E exposures by the three-year average of paid losses, and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to pay off current reserves based on recent average payments. Because this ratio can be significantly impacted by a number of factors such as loss payout variability, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy based simply on the survival ratio. At December 31, 2016, the property and casualty insurance segment's three-year survival ratios compare favorably with industry survival ratios published by A.M. Best (as of December 31, 2015) as detailed in the following table: Table 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three-Year Survival Ratio (% Times Paid Losses)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total A&E\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AFG (12/31/2016)\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industry (12/31/2015)\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG has periodically conducted comprehensive external studies of its asbestos and environmental exposures relating to the run-off operations of its property and casualty insurance segment and exposures related to its former railroad and manufacturing operations with the aid of specialty actuarial, engineering and consulting firms and outside counsel, generally every two years, with an in-depth internal review during the intervening years.\nAn in-depth internal review of AFG's A&E reserves was completed in the third quarter of 2016 by AFG's internal A&E claims specialists and actuaries in consultation with specialty outside counsel and an outside consultant. As a result of the review, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $36 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by\n$5 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $31 million (net of reinsurance). Over the past few years, the focus of AFG's asbestos claims litigation has shifted to smaller companies and companies with ancillary exposures. AFG's insureds with these exposures have been the driver of the property and casualty insurance segment's asbestos reserve increases in recent years. AFG is seeing modestly increasing estimates for indemnity and defense compared to prior studies. Overall, the rate of new asbestos cases received is down modestly. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was primarily associated with updated estimates of site investigation costs with respect to existing sites and newly identified sites. AFG is seeing increased legal defense costs in environmental claims generally, as well as a number of claims and sites where the estimated investigation and remediation costs have increased. As in past years, there were no new or emerging broad industry trends that were identified in the review.\nAs a result of the comprehensive external study completed in the third quarter of 2015, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $67 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $25 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $42 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in property and casualty asbestos reserves was attributed to increased estimates for indemnity and defense costs. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nAs a result of the in-depth internal review completed in the third quarter of 2014, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $24 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $4 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $20 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to AFG's increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nContingencies related to Subsidiaries' Former Operations The A&E studies and reviews discussed above encompassed reserves for various environmental and occupational injury and disease claims and other contingencies arising out of the railroad operations disposed of by American Premier's predecessor and certain manufacturing operations disposed of by American Premier and its subsidiaries and by Great American Financial Resources, Inc. Charges resulting from the A&E study and reviews were $5 million in 2016, $12 million in 2015 and $6 million in 2014. For a discussion of the charges recorded for those operations, see Holding Company, Other and Unallocated - Results of Operations.\u201d Liabilities for claims and contingencies arising from these former railroad and manufacturing operations totaled $86 million at December 31, 2016. For a discussion of the uncertainties in determining the ultimate liability, see Note M - Contingencies\u201d to the financial statements.\nRun-off Long-term Care Insurance In December 2015, AFG completed the sale of United Teacher Associates Insurance Company and Continental General Insurance Company, the legal entities containing substantially all of its run-off long-term care insurance business, to HC2 Holdings, Inc. ( HC2\u201d) for approximately $13 million in net proceeds. AFG may also receive up to $13 million of additional proceeds from HC2 in the future contingent upon the release of certain statutory-basis liabilities of the legal entities sold by AFG. In connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction, AFG agreed to provide up to an aggregate of $35 million of capital support for the insurance companies, on an as-needed basis to maintain specified surplus levels, subject to immediate reimbursement by HC2 through a five-year capital maintenance agreement. With the completion of this sale, AFG divested substantially all of its long-term care business (96% as measured by net statutory reserves as of November 30, 2015) and retained only a small block of long-term care insurance (1,600 policies) with approximately $37 million of reserves at December 31, 2016. AFG will continue to service and accept renewal premiums on its remaining outstanding policies, which are guaranteed renewable.\nMANAGED INVESTMENT ENTITIES\nAccounting standards require AFG to consolidate its investments in collateralized loan obligation ( CLO\u201d) entities that it manages and owns an interest in (in the form of debt). See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements. The effect of consolidating these entities is shown in the tables below (in millions).

GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. For example, core net operating earnings excludes realized gains (losses) on securities because such gains and losses are influenced significantly by financial markets, interest rates and the timing of sales. Similarly, significant gains and losses from the sale of real estate are excluded from core earnings as they are influenced by the timing of sales and realized gains (losses) and significant tax benefits (charges) related to subsidiaries are excluded because such gains and losses are largely the result of the changing business strategy and market opportunities. In addition, special charges related to coverage that AFG no longer writes, such as the Neon exited lines and for asbestos and environmental exposures are excluded from core earnings. The following table (in millions, except per share amounts) identifies non-core items and reconciles net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure. AFG believes core net operating earnings is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends and for management to evaluate financial performance against historical results because it believes this provides a more comparable measure of its continuing business.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

primarily to the fourth quarter 2016 tax benefits related to the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring, net realized gains on securities in the 2016 period compared to net realized losses on securities in the 2015 period and higher core net operating earnings. Core net operating earnings increased $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 reflecting higher operating earnings in the property and casualty and annuity segments.\nNet earnings attributable to shareholders increased $297 million for the full-year of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to the 2016 tax benefits related to the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring, lower special A&E charges recorded in 2016 compared to 2015, net realized gains on securities in 2016 compared to net realized losses on securities in 2015, the estimated loss on the sale of the subsidiaries containing substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015 and higher core net operating earnings, partially offset by a charge related to the exit of certain lines of business within Neon, and lower gains on the sale of real estate in 2016 compared to 2015. Core net operating earnings increased $48 million in 2016 compared to 2015 reflecting higher underwriting profit and net investment income in the ongoing property and casualty insurance operations and higher earnings in the annuity segment, partially offset by lower profitability in the run-off long-term care and life segment and higher holding company expenses.\nNet earnings attributable to shareholders decreased $100 million for the full-year of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to the loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business, higher special A&E charges and net realized losses on securities in 2015 compared to net realized gains on securities in 2014, partially offset by the gain on the sale of a hotel and an apartment property and higher core net operating earnings. Core net operating earnings increased $47 million for the full-year of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to higher underwriting profit and higher net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment and improved core operating results in the run-off long-term care and life segment.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015\nSegmented Statement of Earnings AFG reports its business as four segments: (i) Property and casualty insurance ( P&C\u201d), (ii) Annuity, (iii) Run-off long-term care and life and (iv) Other, which includes holding company costs and income and expenses related to the managed investment entities ( MIEs\u201d).\nAFG's net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. The following tables for the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 identify such items by segment and reconcile net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure that AFG believes is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends (in millions):\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>P&C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annuity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Run-off long-term care and life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consol.

Segment - Results of Operations Performance measures such as underwriting profit or loss and related combined ratios are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance. Underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio, which is a sum of the ratios of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and commissions and other underwriting expenses to premiums. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. The combined ratio does not reflect net investment income, other income, other expenses or federal income taxes.\nAFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $182 million in GAAP pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $179 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $3 million (2%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $182 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of\n$18 million (11%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit in the Property and transportation and Specialty financial insurance sub-segments and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty sub-segment. GAAP earnings also includes a $15 million pretax gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty insurance operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross written premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance premiums ceded\n</td> <td>(358\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(300\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net written premiums\n</td> <td>1,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in unearned premiums\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earned premiums\n</td> <td>1,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and other underwriting expenses\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting gain\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses, net (*)\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pretax non-core gain on sale of apartment property\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*) Excludes the $15 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined Ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>90.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate - including exited lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>90.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG's combined ratio has been better than the industry average for 29 of the last 31 years. Management believes that AFG's insurance operations have performed better than the industry as a result of its specialty niche focus, product line diversification, stringent underwriting discipline and alignment of compensation incentives.\nAFG reports the underwriting performance of its Specialty property and casualty insurance business in the following sub-segments: (i) Property and transportation, (ii) Specialty casualty and (iii) Specialty financial.\nTo understand the overall profitability of particular lines, the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered. Certain short-tail\u201d lines of business (primarily property coverages) generally have quick loss payouts, which reduce the time funds are held, thereby limiting investment income earned thereon. In contrast, long-tail\u201d lines of business (primarily liability coverages and workers' compensation) generally have payouts that are either structured over many years or take many years to settle, thereby significantly increasing investment income earned on related premiums received.\nGross Written Premiums\nGross written premiums ( GWP\u201d) for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment were $1.44 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $1.36 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $85 million (6%).

Overall average renewal rates were up 1% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nProperty and transportation Gross written premiums increased $62 million (12%) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was due primarily to higher year-over-year gross written premiums in the crop business. Excluding crop, gross written premiums were comparable to the prior year period. Average renewal rates increased approximately 2% for this group in the fourth quarter of 2016, including a 4% increase in National Interstate's renewal rates. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 5 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting higher cessions in the crop business, primarily related to growth in a rainfall-related product, which is heavily reinsured.\nSpecialty casualty Gross written premiums increased $23 million (3%) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Higher gross written premiums in the targeted markets and executive liability businesses were partially offset by lower premiums in the excess and surplus lines operations, primarily the result of more stringent underwriting standards related to New York contractors business, as well as lower premiums within the workers' compensation businesses. Average renewal rates for this group were flat in the fourth quarter of 2016, and include a decrease of approximately 2% in the workers' compensation business. Excluding the workers' compensation business, average renewal rates for this group increased approximately 1% during the quarter. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 1 percentage point for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting a change in the mix of business.\nSpecialty financial Gross written premiums increased $1 million (1%) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to growth in the fidelity and crime, surety and equipment leasing businesses, partially offset by lower premiums in the financial institutions business. Average renewal rates for this group were down approximately 1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums are comparable between periods.\nOther specialty The amounts shown as reinsurance premiums ceded represent business assumed by AFG's internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG's other Specialty property and casualty insurance sub-segments.\nCombined Ratio\nPerformance measures such as the combined ratio are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) and underwriting expense ratios. These ratios are calculated by dividing each of the respective expenses by net earned premiums.

insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $110 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $10 million (10%). The higher underwriting profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects improved underwriting results in the Property and transportation and Specialty financial sub-segments, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty sub-segment. Overall catastrophe losses were $12 million (1.1 points on the combined ratio) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $9 million (0.8 points on the combined ratio) in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nProperty and transportation Underwriting profit for this group was $75 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $41 million (121%) reflecting higher underwriting profit in the crop insurance business, primarily the result of favorable growing conditions and relatively stable commodity pricing.\nSpecialty casualty Underwriting profit for this group was $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $37 million (74%). This decrease is due primarily to underwriting losses in one of the excess and surplus lines businesses, primarily related to coverage written for New York contractors, and lower profitability in the targeted markets business.\nSpecialty financial Underwriting profit for this group was $20 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $5 million (33%) reflecting higher underwriting profit in the financial institutions, surety and trade credit businesses.\nOther specialty Underwriting profit for this group was $2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $1 million (100%).\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nAFG's overall loss and LAE ratio was 63.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 61.8% for fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 1.9 percentage points.

catastrophe losses\nThe current accident year loss and LAE ratio, excluding catastrophe losses for AFG's Specialty property and casualty insurance operations was 61.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 61.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 0.3%.\nProperty and transportation The 4.8 percentage point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses reflects a decrease in the loss and LAE ratio of the crop business and, to a lesser extent, the equine business and the Singapore branch in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSpecialty casualty The 4.6 percentage point increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses reflects an increase in the loss and LAE ratio of the targeted markets, general liability, excess and surplus and workers' compensation businesses and at Neon.\nSpecialty financial The 2.3 percentage point increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses reflects an increase in the loss and LAE ratio of the financial institutions business.\nNet prior year reserve development\nAFG's Specialty property and casualty insurance operations recorded net adverse reserve development related to prior accident years of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net favorable reserve development related to prior accident years of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nProperty and transportation Net adverse reserve development of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects reserve strengthening at National Interstate and higher than expected claim severity in the ocean marine business. Net adverse reserve development of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects higher than expected claim severity in commercial auto liability insurance at National Interstate and higher than expected claim frequency in the ocean marine business, partially offset by lower than expected claim severity in the property and inland marine business.\nSpecialty casualty Net adverse reserve development of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects higher than anticipated severity in New York contractor claims, adverse reserve development at Neon and higher than anticipated claim severity in the targeted programs business, partially offset by lower than anticipated claim frequency and severity in the workers' compensation businesses. Net favorable reserve development of $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in workers' compensation business, excess liability insurance and directors and officers liability insurance, partially offset by adverse reserve development at Neon.\nSpecialty financial Net favorable reserve development of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects lower than expected claim frequency in the financial institutions business and lower than anticipated claim severity in the fidelity and crime business. Net favorable reserve development of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the fidelity business, lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the surety business and lower than expected claim severity on a run-off block of collateral value insurance, partially offset by higher than expected claim severity in products for financial institutions and in the trade credit business.\nOther specialty In addition to the reserve development discussed above, total Specialty prior year reserve development includes net favorable reserve development of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting amortization of the deferred gain on the retroactive insurance transaction entered into in connection with the sale of businesses in 1998 and 2001 and reserve development associated with AFG's internal reinsurance program.\nCatastrophe losses\nAFG generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and the purchase of reinsurance. Based on data available at December 31, 2016, AFG's exposure to a catastrophic earthquake or windstorm that industry models indicate could occur once in every 500 years (a 500-year event\u201d) is expected to be less than 4% of AFG's Shareholders' Equity. Catastrophe losses of $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 resulted primarily from Hurricane Matthew. The $5 million of catastrophe losses in the Specialty financial group in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted primarily from flooding in the midwestern United States.\nCommissions and Other Underwriting Expenses\nAFG's property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses ( U/W Exp\u201d) were $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $327 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $22 million (7%). AFG's underwriting expense ratio, calculated as commissions and other underwriting expenses divided by net premiums earned, was 26.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 29.2% for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 2.5 percentage points.

In recent years, yields available in the financial markets on fixed maturity securities have generally declined, placing downward pressure on AFG's investment portfolio yield.

The property and casualty insurance segment's overall yield on investments (net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets) was 3.48% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 3.25% for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 0.23 percentage points, reflecting a $5 million increase in income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings and an $8 million increase in equity in the earnings of limited partnerships and similar investments, partially offset by slightly higher investment expenses and lower yields available in the financial markets. The 7% increase in average invested assets in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects a higher average balance in cash and cash equivalents.\nProperty and Casualty Other Income and Expenses, Net\nGAAP other income and expenses, net for AFG's property and casualty operations was a net expense of $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net income of $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $18 million (360%).

See Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements.\nInterest expense for AFG's property and casualty operations includes interest charges on long-term debt within the property and casualty operations.\nAnnuity Segment - Results of Operations\nAFG's annuity operations contributed $132 million in pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $31 million (31%). AFG's annuity segment results for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflect higher investment income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings and an 11% increase in average annuity investments (at amortized cost). In addition, the annuity segment's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 benefitted from the positive impact of a significant increase in interest rates on the fair value accounting for fixed-indexed annuities ( FIAs\u201d). Both periods reflect the positive impact of strong stock market performance on fair value accounting for FIAs. These improved results were partially offset by the impact of lower investment yields due to the run-off of higher yielding investments. AFG's periodic detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations resulted in a net annuity expense reduction of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe following table details AFG's earnings before income taxes from its annuity operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity benefits (*)\n</td> <td>160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetail of annuity earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions):\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes -

Performance measures such as net interest spread and net spread earned are often presented by annuity businesses to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance.\nNet Spread on Fixed Annuities (excludes variable annuity earnings)\nThe table below (dollars in millions) details the components of these spreads for AFG's fixed annuity operations (including fixed-indexed annuities):\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>29,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As % of fixed annuity benefits accumulated (except as noted):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (as % of fixed annuity investments)\n</td> <td>4.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited - fixed\n</td> <td>(2.02\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.12\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest spread\n</td> <td>2.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefit expenses, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>(0.38\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.31\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>(1.06\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.75\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>(0.35\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.32\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking\n</td> <td>0.03\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment's net spread earned on fixed annuities:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities - before impact of derivatives related to FIAs\n</td> <td>1.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related impact on amortization of DPAC (*)\n</td> <td>(0.31\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related impact on amortization of deferred sales inducements (*)\n</td> <td>(0.02\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>An estimate of the related acceleration/deceleration of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnuity Net Investment Income\nNet investment income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $346 million compared to $309 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $37 million (12%). This increase reflects primarily the growth in AFG's annuity business and higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by the impact of lower investment yields. The overall yield earned on investments in AFG's fixed annuity operations, calculated as net investment income divided by average investment balances (at amortized cost), increased by 0.07 percentage points to 4.72% from 4.65% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase in net investment yield reflects higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by (i) the investment of new premium dollars at lower yields as compared to the existing investment portfolio and (ii) the impact of the reinvestment of proceeds from maturity and redemption of higher yielding investments at the lower yields available in the financial markets. During 2016, $4.0 billion in annuity segment investments with an average yield of 5.51% were redeemed or sold while the investments purchased during 2016 (with new premium dollars and the redemption/sale proceeds) had an average yield at purchase of 4.21%.\nAnnuity Interest Credited - Fixed\nInterest credited - fixed for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $148 million compared to $138 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $10 million (7%). The impact of growth in the annuity business was partially offset by lower interest crediting rates on new premiums as compared to the crediting rates on policyholder funds surrendered or withdrawn. The average interest rate credited to policyholders, calculated as interest credited divided by average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, decreased 0.10 percentage points to 2.02% from 2.12% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nAnnuity Net Interest Spread\nAFG's net interest spread increased 0.17 percentage points to 2.70% from 2.53% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to the impact of lower crediting rates and higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by lower in-force investment yields. Features included in current annuity product offerings allow AFG to achieve its desired profitability at a lower net interest spread than historical product offerings. As a result, AFG expects its net interest spread to narrow in the future.\nAnnuity Policy Charges and Other Miscellaneous Income\nAnnuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income, which consist primarily of surrender charges, amortization of deferred upfront policy charges (unearned revenue) and income from sales of real estate were $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $2 million (18%). The fourth quarter of 2016 includes gains of $2 million from the sale of real estate. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges related to unearned revenue, annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated were 0.15% in both the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income.\nOther Annuity Benefits, Net of Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit Fees\nOther annuity benefits, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees (excluding the impact of unlocking) for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $28 million compared to $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $9 million (47%). As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these net expenses increased 0.07 percentage points to 0.38% from 0.31% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition to interest credited to policyholders' accounts and the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, annuity benefits expense also includes the following expenses (in millions, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees): Table 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in expected death and annuitization reserve\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of sales inducements\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in other benefit reserves\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offset guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed under Annuity Benefits Accumulated\u201d in Note A - Accounting Policies\u201d to the financial statements, guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserves are accrued for and modified using assumptions similar to those used in establishing and amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs. The guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve related to FIAs can be inversely impacted by the calculated FIA embedded derivative reserve as the value to policyholders of the guaranteed withdrawal benefits decreases when the benefit of stock market participation increases.\nAnnuity Acquisition Expenses\nExcluding the impact of unlocking charges (expense reductions) discussed under Annuity Unlocking\u201d below, AFG's amortization of DPAC and commission expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated was 1.06% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 0.75% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and has generally ranged between 0.75% and 0.85%. Variances from the general range relate primarily to the impact of (i) material changes in interest rates or the stock market on AFG's fixed-indexed annuity business, and (ii) differences in actual experience from actuarially projected estimates and assumptions. For example, the positive impact of the significantly higher than anticipated interest rates and strong stock market performance during the fourth quarter of 2016 on the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (discussed below) resulted in a partially offsetting acceleration in the amortization of DPAC. During the third quarter of 2015, the deceleration in the amortization of DPAC caused by the negative impact of poor stock market performance on the fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities was limited on certain recently issued products. This prior period limitation had a $5 million favorable impact on the amortization of DPAC related to the fair value accounting for those derivatives when the stock market rebounded during the fourth quarter of 2015. This favorable impact is reported in the impact on DPAC of derivatives related to FIAs.\nThe table below illustrates the estimated impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on annuity acquisition expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Before the impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the amortization of DPAC\n</td> <td>0.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in fair value of derivatives related to FIAs on the amortization of DPAC (*)\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.06\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity acquisition expenses as a % of fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>1.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>An estimate of the acceleration/deceleration in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs resulting from fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnuity Other Expenses\nAnnuity other expenses were $27 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $5 million (23%). Annuity other expenses represent primarily general and administrative expenses, as well as selling and issuance expenses that are not deferred. The increase in annuity other expenses reflects primarily growth in the business and an increase in the number of sales personnel focused on new initiatives and increased market share within existing financial institutions and retail marketing organizations in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. As\na percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these expenses increased 0.03 percentage points to 0.35% from 0.32% for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives Related to Fixed-Indexed Annuities\nAFG's fixed-indexed annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing stock market index. AFG attempts to mitigate the risk in the index-based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index. AFG's strategy is designed so that the change in the fair value of the call option assets will generally offset the economic change in the liabilities from the index participation. Both the index-based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives that must be adjusted for changes in fair value through earnings each period. The fair values of these derivatives are impacted by actual and expected stock market performance and interest rates as well as other factors. For a list of other factors impacting the fair value of the index-based component of AFG's annuity benefits accumulated, see Note D - Fair Value Measurements\u201d to the financial statements. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges, the net change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities decreased annuity benefits by $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and had a nominal impact on annuity benefits in the fourth quarter of 2015. The $54 million decrease in annuity benefits in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects the positive impact of significantly higher than anticipated interest rates and strong market performance on the fair value of these derivatives. As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, this net expense reduction increased 0.71 percentage points to 0.73% in the fourth quarter of 2016 from 0.02% in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFluctuations in interest rates and the stock market, among other factors, can cause volatility in the periodic measurement of fair value of the embedded derivative that management believes can be inconsistent with the long-term economics of these products. The table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions):\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes - before change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related impact on amortization of DPAC (*)\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(600\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>An estimate of the related acceleration/deceleration of amortization of deferred sales inducements and deferred policy acquisition costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs illustrated in the table above, the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, including the related impact on amortization of DPAC, increased the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes by $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and by $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses. Unanticipated spread compression, decreases in the stock market, adverse mortality experience, and higher than expected lapse rates could lead to future write-offs of DPAC or the present value of future profits on business in force of companies acquired ( PVFP\u201d).\nAnnuity Net Spread Earned on Fixed Annuities\nAFG's net spread earned on fixed annuities increased 0.43 percentage points to 1.82% from 1.39% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to the net impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives and related DPAC amortization offset discussed above and the 0.17 percentage points increase in AFG's net interest spread.\nAnnuity Benefits Accumulated\nAnnuity premiums received and benefit payments are recorded as increases or decreases in annuity benefits accumulated rather than as revenue and expense. Increases in this liability for interest credited and other benefits are charged to expense and decreases for surrender and other policy charges are credited to other income.\nFor certain products, annuity benefits accumulated also includes reserves for accrued persistency and premium bonuses, excess benefits expected to be paid on future deaths and annuitizations ( EDAR\u201d) and guaranteed withdrawal benefits.

There is considerable discussion surrounding the possibility of a delay or other action impacting the rule. On February 9, 2017, the DOL filed a notice with the Office of Management and Budget to delay implementation of the regulation. However, until there is some definitive action impacting the rule, AFG intends to continue to pursue necessary changes.\nAssuming the rule becomes effective in its current form, AFG believes the biggest impact will be on insurance-only licensed agents whose sales represented less than 10% of its fourth quarter annuity premium. While AFG's management continues to believe the adjustments required of AFG and its distribution partners to comply with the rule will impact 2017 annuity premiums, management does not believe the new rule will have a material impact on AFG's results of operations.\nAnnuity Unlocking\nIn the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, AFG conducted a detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations. As a result of these reviews, AFG recorded net expense reductions related to its annuity business of $1 million in 2016 and $10 million in 2015, which impacted AFG's financial statements as follows (in millions):\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unearned revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity benefits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-indexed annuity embedded derivative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales inducements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total annuity benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net expense reduction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net expense reduction from unlocking annuity assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects the favorable impact of an increase in projected net interest spreads on in-force business, substantially offset by the unfavorable impact of (i) changes in projected policyholder annuitization and lapse behavior, (ii) an increase in the risk premium for the uncertainty in the cash flows component of the discount rates used to value the FIA-related embedded derivative and (iii) a slight decrease in projected stock market growth over the next three years. Reinvestment rate assumptions are based primarily on 7-year and 10-year corporate bond yields. For the 2016 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 4.24% in 2017, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.55% in 2022 and beyond.\nThe table below compares the reinvestment rate assumed in AFG's fourth quarter unlockings for the next calendar year to the actual reinvestment rate achieved in that period (both net of investment expenses):\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reinvestment Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumed (*)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Achieved\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>Assumed reinvestment rates exclude default rates of 0.18% in each period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement believes that these results demonstrate that AFG's reinvestment rate assumptions are reasonable and prudently conservative. In addition to the reinvestment rates above, actual default rates in 2015 and 2016 were lower than the long-term default rates of 0.18% assumed in the unlocking in each of the periods above.\nThe 2015 net expense reduction was due primarily to the impact of changes in assumptions to reflect higher than previously projected net interest spreads as well as the impact of higher assets under management and expense discipline. For the 2015 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 3.87% in 2016, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.53% in 2022 and beyond.\nAnnuity Earnings before Income Taxes Reconciliation\nThe following table reconciles the net spread earned on AFG's fixed annuities to overall annuity pretax earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings on fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings on investments in excess of fixed annuity benefits accumulated (*)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable annuity earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>Net investment income (as a % of investments) of 4.72% and 4.65% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, multiplied by the difference between average fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost) and average fixed annuity benefits accumulated in each period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRun-off Long-Term Care and Life Segment - Results of Operations AFG's run-off long-term care and life segment reported GAAP pretax earnings of $2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.

Net Investment Income\nAFG recorded net investment income on investments held outside of its insurance operations of less than $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nHolding Company and Other - P&C Fees and Related Expenses\nSummit, the workers' compensation insurance business that AFG acquired in April 2014, collects fees from a small group of unaffiliated insurers for providing underwriting, policy administration and claims services. In addition, certain of AFG's property and casualty businesses collect fees from customers for ancillary services such as workplace safety programs and premium financing. In the fourth quarter of 2016, AFG collected $17 million in fees for these services compared to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Management views this fee income, net of the $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, in expenses incurred to generate such fees, as a reduction in the cost of underwriting its property and casualty insurance policies. Consistent with internal management reporting, these fees and the related expenses are netted and recorded as a reduction of commissions and other underwriting expenses in AFG's segmented results.\nHolding Company and Other - Other Income\nOther income in the table above includes $5 million and $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, in management fees paid to AFG by the AFG-managed CLOs (AFG's consolidated managed investment entities). The management fees are eliminated in consolidation - see the other income line in the Consolidate MIEs column under Results of Operations - Segmented Statement of Earnings.\u201d Excluding amounts eliminated in consolidation, AFG recorded other income outside of its insurance operations of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nHolding Company and Other - Interest Charges on Borrowed Money\nAFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $5 million (31%). This increase reflects higher average indebtedness, partially offset by lower average interest rates on outstanding debt.

Approximately $7 million in impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2016 are related to an equity investment in a pharmaceutical company. Approximately $26 million of the charges in the fourth quarter of 2015 are attributable to real estate and mortgage related investments, $12 million are on investments in asset managers and $8 million are on energy related investments.\nConsolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Subsidiaries The $4 million pretax realized loss on subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2015 represents an adjustment to the previously recognized $162 million estimated pretax loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015.\nConsolidated Income Taxes AFG's consolidated provision (credit) for income taxes was a benefit of $71 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to an expense of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $151 million (189%).

Due to the uncertainty concerning the realization of the deferred tax benefits associated with these losses, AFG maintains a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets.\nAs discussed in Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements, AFG acquired the noncontrolling interest in National Interstate Corporation in November 2016. This transaction allowed National Interstate and its subsidiaries to become members of the AFG consolidated tax group, which resulted in a tax benefit of $66 million to AFG during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn connection with the ongoing reorganization of AFG's Neon Lloyd's business, in December 2016, AFG undertook a restructuring that included the liquidation for tax purposes of the foreign subsidiary that is the parent of the Neon Lloyd's operations, resulting in a taxable loss for U.S. tax purposes. AFG reported the $111 million tax benefit associated with this loss in the fourth quarter of 2016. See Note L - Income Taxes\u201d to the financial statements.\nExcluding the tax benefit related to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in NATL and the tax benefit related to the Neon restructuring, AFG's effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was 33%.\nConsolidated Noncontrolling Interests AFG's consolidated net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014\nSegmented Statement of Earnings AFG reports its business as four segments: (i) Property and casualty insurance ( P&C\u201d), (ii) Annuity, (iii) Run-off long-term care and life and (iv) Other, which includes holding company costs and income and expenses related to the managed investment entities ( MIEs\u201d).\nAFG's net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. The following tables for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 identify such items by segment and reconcile net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure that AFG believes is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends (in millions):\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>P&C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annuity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Run-off long-term care and life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consol.

of Operations AFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $577 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2016 compared to $576 million in 2015, an increase of $1 million. Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $646 million in 2016 compared to $577 million in 2015, an increase of $69 million (12%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects improved underwriting results in the Property and transportation group and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty and Specialty financial groups. GAAP pretax earnings also reflect a pretax non-core charge of $65 million in the second quarter of 2016 related to the exit of certain lines of business within Neon and a $32 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a $51 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of a hotel in the second quarter of 2015 and a $15 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as non-core special A&E charges of $36 million in 2016 compared to $67 million in 2015.\nAFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $576 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 compared to $456 million in 2014, an increase of $120 million (26%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $577 million in 2015\ncompared to $480 million in 2014, an increase of $97 million (20%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit across each of AFG's property and casualty insurance sub-segments, higher net investment income (due primarily to the investment of cash acquired in the Summit acquisition on April 1, 2014) and lower net expenses. The increase in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 also reflects pretax non-core gains of $51 million on the sale of a hotel and $15 million on the sale of an apartment property, partially offset by higher non-core special A&E charges in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nThe following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty insurance operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 -

Overall average renewal rates were flat in 2016.\nThe $355 million (6%) increase in gross written premiums in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects $535 million in premiums from Summit (acquired in April 2014) in 2015 compared to $414 million in 2014 as well as significant growth in other businesses within the Specialty casualty and Property and transportation groups. Overall average renewal rates increased approximately 1% in 2015.\nProperty and transportation Gross written premiums increased $49 million (2%) in 2016 compared to 2015. This increase was the result of higher premiums in the agricultural businesses, growth in the transportation businesses and higher gross written premiums from the Singapore branch, which opened for business in June 2015, partially offset by lower gross written premiums in the property and inland marine businesses. Average renewal rates increased approximately 3% for this group in 2016, including a 5% increase in National Interstate's renewal rates. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums were comparable in 2016 and 2015.\nGross written premiums increased $113 million (5%) in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase is the result of higher gross written premiums in the transportation businesses due primarily to new accounts, higher gross written premiums in the agricultural businesses and new gross written premiums from the Singapore branch, which opened for business in June 2015, partially offset by lower gross written premiums in the property and inland marine businesses. Average renewal rates were up approximately 4% for this group in 2015, including a 5% increase in National Interstate's renewal rates. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums were comparable in 2015 and 2014.\nSpecialty casualty Gross written premiums increased $53 million (2%) in 2016 compared to 2015. Higher gross written premiums in the excess and surplus, targeted markets and workers' compensation businesses were partially offset by lower premiums in the general liability business and by Neon's exit of certain lines of business and implementation of more stringent underwriting standards at Neon. Lower premiums in the general liability business were primarily the result of competitive market conditions, re-underwriting efforts within the Florida homebuilders market and the slowdown within the energy sector. Average renewal rates decreased approximately 1% for this group in 2016, including a decrease of approximately 4% in the workers' compensation businesses. Excluding the workers' compensation business, average renewal rates for this group increased approximately 1% during 2016. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 2 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting the cession of Neon's UK medical malpractice business and a change in the mix of business at Neon.\nGross written premiums increased $210 million (8%) in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting $535 million in gross written premiums from Summit (acquired in April 2014) in 2015 compared to $414 million in 2014. Excluding premiums from Summit, gross written premiums increased 4% in 2015 compared to 2014. While most of the businesses in this group reported growth, the workers' compensation, excess and surplus lines and targeted markets businesses were primary drivers of the higher premiums, partially offset by lower premiums in the general liability business, primarily the result of competitive market conditions, re-underwriting efforts within the Florida homebuilders market and the slowdown within the energy sector. Average renewal rates for this group were down 1% in 2015 due primarily to lower pricing in the workers' compensation businesses. Excluding the workers' compensation business, average renewal rates in this group increased 1% during 2015. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums declined 1 percentage point in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Summit, which cedes only about 1% of its premiums.\nSpecialty financial Gross written premiums increased $48 million (8%) in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to growth in the financial institutions and surety businesses. Average renewal rates for this group decreased approximately 1% in 2016. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 1 percentage point in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting higher cessions in the financial institutions business, partially offset by a decline in auto dealer business, which is heavily reinsured.\nGross written premiums increased $32 million (5%) in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to higher gross written premiums in the surety, financial institutions and equipment leasing businesses. Average renewal rates for this group were flat in 2015. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums decreased 4 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting a decline in auto dealer business, which is heavily reinsured.\nOther specialty The amounts shown as reinsurance premiums ceded represent business assumed by AFG's internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG's other Specialty

</tr>\n</table>\nThe Specialty property and casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $337 million in 2016 compared to $295 million in 2015, an increase of $42 million (14%). The higher underwriting profit in 2016 reflects higher underwriting profit in the Property and transportation sub-segment, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty and Specialty financial sub-segments. Overall catastrophe losses were $55 million (1.3 points on the combined ratio) in 2016 compared to $35 million (0.8 points on the combined ratio) in 2015.\nThe Specialty property and casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $295 million in 2015 compared to $237 million in 2014, an increase of $58 million (24%). The higher underwriting profit in 2015 reflects higher underwriting profit across each of AFG's property and casualty insurance sub-segments. Overall catastrophe losses were $35 million (0.8 points on the combined ratio) in 2015 compared to $28 million (0.7 points on the combined ratio) in 2014.\nProperty and transportation Underwriting profit for this group was $166 million in 2016 compared to $48 million in 2015, an increase of $118 million (246%). This improvement reflects higher underwriting profit in the crop insurance business, primarily the result of favorable growing conditions and relatively stable commodity pricing and higher underwriting profits in the transportation and property and inland marine businesses. These improved results were partially offset by an increase of $10 million in catastrophe losses in 2016 compared to 2015.\nUnderwriting profit for this group was $48 million in 2015 compared to $21 million in 2014, an increase of $27 million (129%). Higher profits in the agricultural operations and improved year-over-year underwriting results at National Interstate, due primarily to lower adverse prior year reserve development, were partially offset by lower profitability in the property and inland marine, ocean marine and other transportation businesses.\nSpecialty casualty Underwriting profit for this group was $78 million in 2016 compared to $146 million in 2015, a decrease of $68 million (47%). Higher underwriting profitability in the workers' compensation businesses, due primarily to higher favorable prior year reserve development, and improved results in the general liability business were more than offset by adverse prior year reserve development in the excess and surplus and targeted markets businesses, current accident year trade credit losses in Neon's political risk and trade credit business and higher catastrophe losses.\nUnderwriting profit for this group was $146 million in 2015 compared to $136 million in 2014, an increase of $10 million (7%). This increase is due primarily to higher profitability in the workers' compensation and targeted markets businesses, partially offset by higher adverse prior year reserve development at Neon and in the general liability and excess and surplus businesses and lower favorable prior year reserve development in the executive liability business.\nSpecialty financial Underwriting profit for this group was $84 million in 2016 compared to $87 million in 2015, a decrease of $3 million (3%). Higher underwriting profit in the fidelity and crime and surety businesses, primarily the result of higher favorable prior year reserve development, was more than offset by lower underwriting profit in the financial institutions and trade credit businesses, resulting primarily from lower favorable prior year reserve development.\nUnderwriting profit for this group was $87 million in 2015 compared to $64 million in 2014, an increase of $23 million (36%). This increase was driven by higher favorable prior year reserve development across the group and higher current year underwriting profitability in the fidelity and financial institutions businesses, partially offset by an increase of $6 million in catastrophe losses in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOther specialty Underwriting profit for this group was $9 million in 2016 compared to $14 million in 2015, a decrease of $5 million (36%). The decrease is due primarily to lower favorable prior year loss development in the business assumed by AFG's internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG's other Specialty sub-segments.\nUnderwriting profit for this group was $14 million in 2015 compared to $16 million in 2014, a decrease of $2 million (13%).\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nAFG's overall loss and LAE ratio was 63.8% in both 2016 and 2015 and 64.3% in 2014.

losses and LAE, excluding catastrophe losses\nThe current accident year loss and LAE ratio, excluding catastrophe losses for AFG's Specialty property and casualty insurance operations was 61.8% in 2016, 62.2% in 2015 and 63.5% in 2014.\nProperty and transportation The 3.9 percentage point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses in 2016 compared to 2015 reflects a decrease in the loss and LAE ratio of the crop, equine, transportation and property and inland marine businesses and the Singapore branch.\nThe 2.4 percentage point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects higher profitability in the agricultural businesses.\nSpecialty casualty The 2.8 percentage point increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses in 2016 compared to 2015 reflects an increase in current accident year trade credit losses in Neon's political risk and trade credit business and an increase in the loss and LAE ratio of the targeted markets, general liability and excess and surplus businesses.\nThe 0.3 percentage point increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects the inclusion of Summit following its acquisition in April 2014, which has a higher loss and LAE ratio than AFG's overall Specialty casualty group.\nSpecialty financial The loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses is comparable in 2016 and 2015.\nThe 3.2 percentage point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects an improvement in the loss and LAE ratio of the financial institutions, fidelity and equipment leasing businesses.\nNet prior year reserve development\nAFG's Specialty property and casualty insurance operations recorded net favorable reserve development related to prior accident years of $61 million in 2016 compared to $37 million in 2015 and $19 million in 2014, an increase of $24 million (65%) and $18 million (95%), respectively.\nProperty and transportation Net favorable reserve development of $21 million in 2016 reflects lower than expected losses in the crop operations and lower than expected claim severity in the property and inland marine and trucking businesses, partially offset by reserve strengthening at National Interstate and higher than expected claim frequency in the ocean marine business.\nNet adverse reserve development of $15 million in 2015 reflects higher than expected claim severity at National Interstate and higher than anticipated claim frequency in the ocean marine business, partially offset by lower than expected claim severity in the property and inland marine business, agricultural operations and a run-off book of homebuilders business.\nNet adverse reserve development of $16 million in 2014 reflects higher than expected severity in commercial auto liability losses written in the transportation businesses, partially offset by lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the property and inland marine business and lower than expected claim frequency in the agricultural operations.\nSpecialty casualty Net favorable reserve development of $13 million in 2016 reflects lower than anticipated claim frequency and severity in workers' compensation business, lower than expected claim severity in directors and officers liability insurance and lower than expected claim frequency and severity in excess liability business, partially offset by adverse reserve development at Neon, higher than anticipated severity in New York contractor claims, higher than anticipated claim frequency and severity in general liability insurance and higher than expected claim frequency and severity in the targeted markets business.\nNet favorable reserve development of $11 million in 2015 includes lower than anticipated claim severity in workers' compensation business, lower than anticipated claim severity and frequency in excess liability insurance and lower than expected claim severity in directors and officers liability insurance, partially offset by adverse reserve development at Neon.\nNet favorable reserve development of $7 million in 2014 reflects lower than expected claim severity in directors and officers liability insurance, lower than expected claim severity and frequency in excess liability insurance and lower than anticipated claim severity in specialty workers' compensation business, partially offset by higher than expected severity in contractor claims and in a run-off book of casualty business and adverse reserve development at Neon.\nSpecialty financial Net favorable reserve development of $23 million in 2016 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the fidelity and crime business, lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the surety business and lower than anticipated claim frequency in the financial institutions business.\nNet favorable reserve development of $30 million in 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim frequency and severity in the surety business and products for financial institutions and lower than expected claim severity in the fidelity business and run-off collateral value insurance.\nNet favorable reserve development of $17 million in 2014 reflects lower than expected claim severity in the surety and fidelity businesses and lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the trade credit business and products for financial institutions.\nOther specialty In addition to the reserve development discussed above, total Specialty prior year reserve development includes net favorable reserve development of $4 million in 2016 and $11 million in both 2015 and 2014, reflecting\namortization of the deferred gain on the retroactive insurance transaction entered into in connection with the sale of businesses in 1998 and 2001 and reserve development associated with AFG's internal reinsurance program.\nAsbestos and environmental reserve charges As previously discussed under Uncertainties\u201d - Asbestos and Environmental-related ( A&E\u201d) Insurance Reserves,\u201d AFG has established property and casualty reserves for claims related to environmental exposures and asbestos claims. Total charges recorded to increase reserves (net of reinsurance recoverable) for A&E exposures of AFG's property and casualty group (included in loss and loss adjustment expenses) were $36 million in 2016, $67 million in 2015 and $24 million in 2014.\nNeon exited lines charge During the second quarter of 2016, AFG's specialist Lloyd's market insurer completed a strategic review of its business under a new leadership team and re-launched as Neon Underwriting Ltd. As part of its strategic review, Neon sold and/or exited certain historical lines of business including its UK and international medical malpractice and general liability classes. As a result of Neon's claims review of its exited lines of business, AFG recorded a charge of approximately $65 million including $57 million to increase loss reserves primarily related to its medical malpractice and general liability lines. Consistent with the treatment of other items that are not indicative of AFG's ongoing operations (both favorable and unfavorable), this charge is being treated as non-core because it resulted from a special strategic review of lines of business that Neon no longer writes.\nAggregate Aggregate net prior accident years reserve development for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment includes the A&E charges and Neon exited lines charge mentioned above and adverse reserve development of $3 million in 2015 and $1 million in 2014 related to business outside of the Specialty group that AFG no longer writes.\nCatastrophe losses\nAFG generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and the purchase of reinsurance. Catastrophe losses of $55 million in 2016 resulted primarily from winter storms in the first quarter, storms in Texas in the second quarter, flooding in Louisiana and multiple storms in the southern United States in the third quarter and Hurricane Matthew in the fourth quarter. Catastrophe losses of $35 million in 2015 resulted primarily from winter storms in the first quarter, multiple storms in the midwestern and central United States in the second and third quarters and flooding in the midwestern United States in the fourth quarter. Catastrophe losses of $20 million in the Property and transportation group in 2014 were primarily from winter storms in the month of January and multiple storms in the midwestern and central United States in the second quarter.\nCommissions and Other Underwriting Expenses\nAFG's property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses ( U/W Exp\u201d) were $1.33 billion in 2016 compared to $1.30 billion in 2015, an increase of $26 million (2%). AFG's underwriting expense ratio was 30.7% in 2016 compared to 30.9% in 2015, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points.\nAFG's property and casualty U/W Exp were $1.30 billion in 2015 compared to $1.17 billion in 2014, an increase of $132 million (11%). AFG's underwriting expense ratio was 30.9% in 2015 compared to 30.2% in 2014, an increase of 0.7 percentage points.\nDetail of AFG's property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses and underwriting expense ratios is shown below (dollars in millions):\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in % of NEP\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>U/W Exp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of NEP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U/W Exp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of NEP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U/W Exp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of NEP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and transportation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty casualty\n</td> <td>608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty financial\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other specialty\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Specialty\n</td> <td>1,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Neon exited lines charge\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Aggregate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG's overall expense ratio decreased 0.2% in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nThe $132 million increase in commissions and other underwriting expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects the acquisition of Summit in April 2014. The overall increase of 0.7% in AFG's expense ratio in 2015 as compared to 2014 reflects higher profitability-based commissions paid to agents and brokers, partially offset by the impact of higher premiums on the ratio.\nProperty and transportation Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 1.5 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015 reflecting an increase in ceding commissions received from reinsurers in the crop business.\nCommissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums increased 0.7 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting higher profitability-based commissions paid to agents and brokers, partially offset by the impact of higher premiums on the ratio.\nSpecialty casualty Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums increased 0.5 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to the impact of lower premiums at Neon on the ratio, partially offset by the impact of a charge in the second quarter of 2015 to write off certain previously capitalized project costs.\nCommissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums increased 0.2 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to a charge of $6 million in the second quarter of 2015 to write off certain previously capitalized project costs, partially offset by the impact of higher premiums on the ratio.\nSpecialty financial Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 0.5 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015 reflecting lower profitability-based commissions paid to agents.\nCommissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums increased 0.8 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting higher profitability-based commissions paid to agents, partially offset by the impact of higher premiums on the ratio.\nAggregate Aggregate commissions and other underwriting expenses for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment includes $8 million of restructuring charges recorded as part of the $65 million non-core charge related to the exit of certain lines of business within Neon, AFG's Lloyd's-based insurer recorded in the second quarter of 2016.

Net investment income in AFG's property and casualty operations was $319 million in 2015 compared to $294 million in 2014, an increase of $25 million (9%). In recent years, yields available in the financial markets on fixed maturity securities have generally declined, placing downward pressure on AFG's investment portfolio yield.

The $31 million increase in the property and casualty insurance segment's net investment income reflects a $13 million increase in income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, an $11 million increase in equity in the earnings of limited partnerships and similar investments and the increase in\naverage invested assets, partially offset by slightly higher investment expenses and lower yields available in the financial markets. The property and casualty segment's overall yield on investments (net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets) was 3.66% in 2016 compared to 3.56% in 2015, reflecting the higher income from investments carried at fair value and partnership earnings discussed above, partially offset by the impact of the lower current market yields discussed above.\nThe increase in average invested assets and net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment in 2015 compared to 2014 is due primarily to the investment of cash acquired in the Summit acquisition, which occurred over the two quarters following the April 2014 acquisition, as well as growth in the property and casualty insurance segment. The property and casualty insurance segment's overall yield on investments was 3.56% in 2015 compared to 3.75% in 2014, a decline of 0.19 percentage points reflecting the impact of lower yields available in the financial markets and lower earnings from other investments.\nProperty and Casualty Other Income and Expenses, Net\nGAAP other income and expenses, net for AFG's property and casualty operations was a net expense of $9 million in 2016, net income of $32 million in 2015, and a net expense of $50 million in 2014.

These expenses consisted primarily of financial advisory and legal services. See Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements.\nAFG and its consolidated subsidiaries incurred $3 million in transaction expenses related to the February 2014 tender offer by GAI to acquire all of the NATL common stock that it did not already own. These expenses consisted primarily of financial advisory and legal services. The tender offer was terminated in March 2014.\nInterest expense for AFG's property and casualty operations includes interest charges on long-term debt within the property and casualty operations.\nAnnuity Segment - Results of Operations\nAFG's annuity operations contributed $368 million in pretax earnings in 2016 compared to $331 million in 2015, an increase of $37 million (11%). The increase in AFG's annuity segment results in 2016 compared to 2015 reflects higher investment income\nfrom certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings and a 12% increase in average annuity investments (at amortized cost), partially offset by lower investment yields due to the run-off of higher yielding investments and higher general and administrative expenses. Included in these results is the change in fair value of derivatives related to FIAs, which had a negative impact of $27 million in 2016 compared to $23 million in 2015. For 2016, the negative impact of a significant drop in interest rates on fair value accounting for FIAs was partially offset by the positive impact of an increase in the stock market. For 2015, fair value accounting for FIAs was negatively impacted by a significant decrease in the stock market and a slightly lower than expected increase in interest rates. AFG's periodic detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations resulted in a net annuity expense reduction of $1 million in 2016 compared to $10 million in 2015.\nAFG's annuity operations contributed $331 million in pretax earnings in 2015 compared to $328 million in 2014, an increase of $3 million (1%). While AFG's average annuity investments (at amortized cost) were 12% higher in 2015 as compared to 2014, the benefit of this growth and the impact that fluctuations in interest rates had on the fair value accounting for FIAs was offset by the negative impact that the stock market decrease had on certain annuity reserves in 2015 compared to a stock market increase in 2014, the run-off of higher yielding investments and higher general and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to 2014. Operating earnings also include a net unlocking expense reduction of $10 million in 2015 compared to $1 million in 2014.\nThe following table details AFG's earnings before income taxes from its annuity operations for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 -

This increase reflects primarily the growth in AFG's annuity business and higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by the impact of lower in-force investment yields. The overall yield earned on investments in AFG's annuity operations, calculated as net investment income divided by average investment balances (at amortized cost), decreased by 0.06 percentage points to 4.77% from 4.83% in 2016 compared to 2015. This decline in net investment yield reflects (i) the investment of new premium dollars at lower yields as compared to the existing investment portfolio and (ii) the impact of the reinvestment of proceeds from maturity and redemption of higher yielding investments at the lower yields available in the financial markets, partially offset by higher investment income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings. During 2016, $4.0 billion in annuity segment investments with an average yield of 5.51% were redeemed or sold while the investments purchased during 2016 (with new premium dollars and the redemption/sale proceeds) had an average yield at purchase of 4.21%.\nNet investment income in 2015 was $1.22 billion compared to $1.14 billion in 2014, an increase of $88 million (8%). This increase reflects primarily the growth in AFG's annuity business, partially offset by the run-off of higher yielding investments. The overall yield earned on investments in AFG's annuity operations declined by 0.20 percentage points to 4.83% from 5.03% in 2015 compared to 2014. This decline in net investment yield reflects (i) the investment of new premium dollars at lower yields as compared to the existing investment portfolio and (ii) the impact of the reinvestment of proceeds from maturity and redemption of higher yielding investments at the lower yields available in the financial markets.\nAnnuity Interest Credited - Fixed\nInterest credited - fixed in 2016 was $574 million compared to $532 million in 2015, an increase of $42 million (8%). The impact of growth in the annuity business was partially offset by lower interest crediting rates on new premiums as compared to the crediting rates on policyholder funds surrendered or withdrawn. The average interest rate credited to policyholders, calculated as interest credited divided by average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, decreased 0.10 percentage points to 2.04% from 2.14% in 2016 compared to 2015.\nInterest credited - fixed in 2015 was $532 million compared to $497 million in 2014, an increase of $35 million (7%). The impact of growth in the annuity business was partially offset by lower interest crediting rates on new premiums as compared to the crediting rates on policyholder funds surrendered or withdrawn. The average interest rate credited to policyholders decreased 0.11 percentage points to 2.14% from 2.25% in 2015 compared to 2014.\nAnnuity Net Interest Spread\nAFG's net interest spread increased 0.04 percentage points to 2.73% from 2.69% in 2016 compared to 2015 as the impact of lower in-force investment yields was more than offset by lower crediting rates and higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings. In addition, features included in current annuity product offerings allow AFG to achieve its desired profitability at a lower net interest spread than historical product offerings. As a result of these items, AFG expects its net interest spread to narrow in the future.\nAFG's net interest spread decreased 0.09 percentage points to 2.69% from 2.78% in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to the run-off of higher yielding investments, partially offset by lower crediting rates.\nAnnuity Policy Charges and Other Miscellaneous Income\nAnnuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income, which consist primarily of surrender charges, amortization of deferred upfront policy charges (unearned revenue) and income from sales of real estate, were $50 million in 2016 compared to $55 million in 2015, a decrease of $5 million (9%). Other miscellaneous income includes $5 million in income from the sale of real estate in 2016 compared to $6 million in 2015. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges of $1 million in 2016 and $2 million in 2015 related to unearned revenue, annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income were $51 million in 2016 compared to $57 million in 2015, a decrease of $6 million (11%). As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income decreased 0.03 percentage points to 0.15% from 0.18% in 2016 compared to 2015.\nAnnuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income were $55 million in 2015 compared to $63 million in 2014, a decrease of $8 million (13%). Excluding the impact of unlocking charges of $2 million in 2015 and unlocking income of $10 million in 2014 related to unearned revenue, annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income were $57 million in 2015 and $53 million in 2014, an increase of $4 million (8%). This increase reflects the impact of $6 million in income from the sale of real estate recorded in 2015.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income.\nOther Annuity Benefits, Net of Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit Fees\nOther annuity benefits, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees (excluding the impact of unlocking) were $92 million in 2016, $87 million in 2015 and $63 million in 2014, representing an increase of $5 million (6%) in 2016 compared to 2015 and an increase of $24 million (38%) in 2015 compared to 2014. As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these net expenses decreased 0.02 percentage points to 0.33% from 0.35% in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 0.07 percentage points to 0.35% from 0.28% in 2015 compared to 2014. In addition to interest credited to policyholders' accounts and the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, annuity benefits expense also includes the following expenses (in millions, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees): Table 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in expected death and annuitization reserve\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of sales inducements\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in other benefit reserves\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits\n</td> <td>145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offset guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed under Annuity Benefits Accumulated\u201d in Note A - Accounting Policies\u201d to the financial statements, guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserves are accrued for and modified using assumptions similar to those used in establishing and amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs. The guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve related to FIAs is inversely impacted by the calculated FIA embedded derivative reserve as the value to policyholders of the guaranteed withdrawal benefits decreases when the benefit of stock market participation increases.\nThe $5 million increase in other annuity benefits, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily reflects growth in the business.\nThe $24 million increase in other annuity benefits, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects higher expenses related to products with guaranteed withdrawal benefit features.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity benefits expense.\nAnnuity Acquisition Expenses\nExcluding the impact of unlocking charges (expense reductions) discussed under Annuity Unlocking\u201d below, AFG's amortization of DPAC and commission expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated was 0.70% in 2016 compared to 0.74% in 2015 and 0.67% in 2014 and has generally ranged between 0.75% and 0.85%. Variances from the general range relate primarily to the impact of (i) material changes in interest rates or the stock market on AFG's fixed-indexed annuity business, and (ii) differences in actual experience from actuarially projected estimates and assumptions. For example, the negative impact of significantly lower than anticipated interest rates during 2016, the significant stock market decrease in 2015 and slightly lower than anticipated interest rates during 2014 on the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (discussed below) resulted in a partially offsetting deceleration in the amortization of DPAC.\nThe table below illustrates the estimated impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on annuity acquisition expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated:\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Before the impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the amortization of DPAC\n</td> <td>0.79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in fair value of derivatives related to FIAs on the amortization of DPAC (*)\n</td> <td>(0.09\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.08\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.11\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity acquisition expenses as a % of fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>0.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>An estimate of the acceleration/deceleration in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs resulting from fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses. Unanticipated spread compression, decreases in the stock market, adverse mortality experience, and higher than expected lapse rates could lead to write-offs of DPAC or PVFP in the future.\nAnnuity Other Expenses\nAnnuity other expenses were $110 million in 2016, $96 million in 2015 and $82 million in 2014, representing an increase of $14 million (15%) in 2016 compared to 2015 and an increase of $14 million (17%) in 2015 compared to 2014. Annuity other expenses represent primarily general and administrative expenses, as well as selling and issuance expenses that are not deferred. As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these expenses increased 0.02 percentage points to 0.38% from 0.36% in 2016 compared to 2015 and 0.02 percentage points to 0.36% from 0.34% in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in annuity other expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily reflects growth in the business as well as an increase in the number of sales personnel focused on new initiatives and increased market share within existing financial institutions and retail marketing associations. The increase in annuity other expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily reflects higher expenses related to professional services and employee compensation plans in 2015. Annuity other expenses for 2014 includes the favorable impact of settling certain accrued expenses at a lower cost than previously estimated.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives Related to Fixed-Indexed Annuities\nAFG's fixed-indexed annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing stock market index. AFG attempts to mitigate the risk in the index-based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index. AFG's strategy is designed so that the change in the fair value of the call option assets will generally offset the economic change in the liabilities from the index participation. Both the index-based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives that must be adjusted for changes in fair value through earnings each period. The fair values of these derivatives are impacted by actual and expected stock market performance and interest rates as well as other factors. For a list of other factors impacting the fair value of the index-based component of AFG's annuity benefits accumulated, see Note D - Fair Value Measurements\u201d to the financial statements. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges, the net change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities increased annuity benefits by $53 million in 2016, $45 million in 2015 and $59 million in 2014. The increase in 2016 is due primarily to significantly lower than expected interest rates, partially offset by the impact of an increase in the stock market. The increase in 2015 reflects the negative impact of the decline in the stock market and lower than anticipated interest rates on these derivatives. The increase in 2014 is due primarily to the impact of lower than anticipated interest rates on these derivatives. As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, this net expense increased 0.01 percentage points to 0.19% from 0.18% in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased 0.09 percentage points to 0.18% from 0.27% in 2015 compared to 2014.\nFluctuations in interest rates and the stock market, among other factors, can cause volatility in the periodic measurement of fair value of the embedded derivative that management believes can be inconsistent with the long-term economics of these products.

Increases in this liability for interest credited and other benefits are charged to expense and decreases for surrender and other policy charges are credited to other income.\nFor certain products, annuity benefits accumulated also includes reserves for accrued persistency and premium bonuses, excess benefits expected to be paid on future deaths and annuitizations ( EDAR\u201d) and guaranteed withdrawal benefits. Annuity benefits accumulated also includes amounts advanced from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati.

In addition, the increase reflects new products, additional staffing, and increased market share within existing financial institutions. This growth slowed in the second half of 2016 as a result of AFG's reduction in crediting rates on its annuities in 2016 due to the decline in market interest rates; these crediting rate reductions were made to maintain appropriate returns on new business.\nManagement attributes the 12% increase in annuity premiums in 2015 compared to 2014 to the significant rise of interest rates during the second quarter of 2015 from first quarter 2015 lows, allowing AFG to raise the crediting rates on its annuities and become more competitive in its markets.\nAnnuity Unlocking\nIn 2016, 2015 and 2014, AFG conducted its detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations. As a result of these reviews, AFG recorded net expense reductions related to its annuity business of $1 million in 2016, $10 million in 2015 and $1 million in 2014, which impacted AFG's financial statements as follows (in millions):\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unearned revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity benefits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-indexed annuities embedded derivative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales inducements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total annuity benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net expense reduction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Results of Operations - Quarters ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 - Annuity Segment - Results of Operations - Annuity Unlocking\u201d for a discussion of the overall net expense reduction from the periodic review of actuarial assumptions in 2016 and 2015.\nAnnuity Earnings before Income Taxes Reconciliation\nThe following table reconciles the net spread earned on AFG's fixed annuities to overall annuity pretax earnings for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings on fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings on investments in excess of fixed annuity benefits accumulated (*)\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable annuity earnings\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*)\n</td> <td>Net investment income (as a % of investments) of 4.77%, 4.83% and 5.03% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, multiplied by the difference between average fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost) and average fixed annuity benefits accumulated in each period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRun-off Long-Term Care and Life Segment - Results of Operations AFG's run-off long-term care and life segment incurred GAAP pretax earnings of $4 million in 2016 compared to losses of $152 million and $10 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

P&C Fees and Related Expenses\nSummit, the workers' compensation insurance business that AFG acquired in April 2014, collects fees from a small group of unaffiliated insurers for providing underwriting, policy administration and claims services. In addition, certain of AFG's property and casualty businesses collect fees from customers for ancillary services such as workplace safety programs and premium financing. In 2016, AFG collected $60 million in fees for these services compared to $54 million in 2015. Management views this fee income, net of the $41 million in 2016 and $38 million in 2015, in expenses incurred to generate such fees, as a reduction in the cost of underwriting its property and casualty insurance policies. Consistent with internal management reporting, these fees and the related expenses are netted and recorded as a reduction of commissions and other underwriting expenses in AFG's segmented results. Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, these fees are shown in other income and the related expenses are shown in other expenses in AFG's Statement of Earnings.\nHolding Company and Other - Other Income\nOther income in the table above includes $17 million, $15 million and $25 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively in management fees paid to AFG by the AFG-managed CLOs (AFG's consolidated managed investment entities). The $25 million of management fees in 2014 includes $13 million of incentive management fees earned in connection with the liquidation of three CLOs. The management fees are eliminated in consolidation - see the other income line in the Consolidated MIEs column under Results of Operations - Segmented Statement of Earnings.\u201d Excluding amounts eliminated in consolidation,\nAFG recorded other income outside of its insurance operations of $6 million in 2016, $9 million in 2015 and $11 million in 2014.\nHolding Company and Other - Interest Charges on Borrowed Money\nAFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded interest expense of $77 million in 2016 compared to $73 million in 2015, an increase of $4 million (5%). This increase reflects higher average indebtedness during 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt and the favorable impact of the interest rate swap on the 9-7/8% Senior Notes due June 2019 that was entered into in June 2015.\nThe increase in average indebtedness for 2016 as compared to 2015 reflects the following financing transactions completed by AFG between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016:\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Issued $300 million of 3.50% Senior Notes in August 2016,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures in November 2015,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Redeemed $132 million of 7% Senior Notes in September 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded interest expense of $73 million in 2015 compared to $70 million in 2014, an increase of $3 million (4%).

The charge in 2016 is due to relatively small movements across several sites that primarily reflect changes in the scope and costs of investigation. The charges in 2015 and 2014 related to slightly higher estimated costs at sites where remediation is underway, coupled with higher estimated cleanup costs at a limited number of sites. Total charges recorded to increase liabilities for A&E exposures of AFG's former railroad and manufacturing operations (included in other expenses) were $20 million in 2016, $22 million in 2015 and $13 million in 2014.\nHolding Company and Other - Loss on Retirement of Debt\nAFG wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $4 million related to the redemption of its $132 million outstanding 7% Senior Notes due 2050 at par value on September 30, 2015.\nHolding Company and Other - Other Expenses\nExcluding the non-core special A&E charges and the non-core loss on retirement of debt discussed above, AFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded other expenses of $128 million in 2016 compared to $115 million in 2015, an increase of $13 million (11%). This increase reflects higher holding company expenses related to employee benefit plans that are tied to stock market performance, a $5 million donation to the University of Cincinnati College of Business in 2016 and higher expenses related to AFG's former railroad and manufacturing operations. AFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded other expenses of $115 million in 2015 compared to $114 million in 2014, an increase of $1 million (1%).\nConsolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities AFG's consolidated realized gains (losses) on securities, which are not allocated to segments, were gains of $19 million in 2016 compared to losses of $19 million in 2015, an increase of $38 million (200%). AFG's consolidated realized losses on securities were $19 million in 2015 compared to gains of $52 million in 2014, a decrease of $71 million (137%).

Approximately $70 million in impairment charges in 2016 are related to financial institutions, $19 million are on energy related investments and $7 million relates to a pharmaceutical company.\nAFG's impairment charges on securities in 2015 consist of $94 million on equity securities, $43 million on fixed maturities and $3 million on other investments. Approximately $41 million of the charges are on real estate and mortgage related investments, $38 million are on energy related investments and $12 million are on investments in asset managers.\nConsolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Subsidiaries In 2015, AFG recorded a pretax realized loss of $166 million on the sale of subsidiaries containing substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business. In the second quarter of 2016, AFG received additional proceeds based on the final closing balance sheet and adjusted certain accrued expense estimates associated with the sale, resulting in a $2 million pretax favorable adjustment to the loss recorded in 2015. See Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements. In addition, AFG recorded a $5 million pretax realized gain in 2015 representing an adjustment to the previously recognized loss on a small property and casualty subsidiary sold several years ago.\nConsolidated Income Taxes AFG's consolidated provision for income taxes was $119 million in 2016 compared to $195 million in 2015, a decrease of $76 million (39%). AFG's consolidated provision for income taxes was $195 million in 2015 compared to $220 million in 2014, a decrease of $25 million (11%). See Note L - Income Taxes\u201d to the financial statements for an analysis of items affecting AFG's effective tax rate.\nConsolidated Noncontrolling Interests AFG's consolidated net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was earnings of $19 million in 2016 compared to $18 million in 2015, an increase of $1 million (6%). AFG's consolidated net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was earnings of $18 million in 2015 compared to a net loss of $46 million in 2014, an improvement of $64 million (139%).

Both properties were owned by an 80%-owned subsidiary of GAI.\nThe losses of Managed Investment Entities in 2014 represent CLO losses that ultimately inure to holders of the CLO debt. See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of accounting\nguidance adopted in 2015 that affects the measurement of the fair value of CLO liabilities. Under the new guidance, there are no longer any CLO earnings or losses to be attributed to noncontrolling interests in AFG's Statement of Earnings.\nRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of accounting guidance adopted on January 1, 2016, which impacts the consolidation of collateralized financing entities such as CLOs, as well as limited partnerships and similar investments.\nSee Note A - Accounting Policies - Debt Issuance Costs\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of accounting guidance adopted on January 1, 2016, which impacted the presentation of debt issuance costs.\nSee Note A - Accounting Policies - Stock-Based Compensation\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of accounting guidance adopted in the fourth quarter of 2016 (effective January 1, 2016), which impacted the accounting for share-based payment transactions.\nSee Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of accounting guidance adopted on January 1, 2015 that impacts the determination of when a component of an entity qualifies for presentation as a discontinued operation.\nSee Note O - Insurance - Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of accounting guidance adopted for annual reporting beginning in 2016, which requires additional disclosures about the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (including accident year information).\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities which, among other things, requires equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, clarifies that the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities should be evaluated with other deferred tax assets and modifies disclosure requirements for financial instruments. AFG will be required to adopt the updated guidance effective January 1, 2018 (early adoption is not permitted). Although recording changes in the fair value of investments in equity securities in net income will result in more volatility in AFG's Statement of Earnings, it is not expected to have a material effect on the carrying value of AFG's investments or on overall shareholders' equity as AFG's investments in equity securities are currently carried at fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires entities that lease assets for terms longer than one year to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on the balance sheet based on the present value of cash flows. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures of the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases will also be required. Although the guidance allows for early adoption, AFG expects to adopt the updated guidance effective January 1, 2019 (when it is required). The guidance will require the earliest comparative period presented to include the measurement and recognition of existing leases with an adjustment to shareholders' equity as if the updated guidance had always been applied. Although the guidance will result in higher assets and higher liabilities from the recognition of assets and liabilities related to operating leases, it does not change the manner in which lease expense is recognized in the statement of earnings. Although management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, AFG does not expect it to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which provides a new credit loss model for determining credit-related impairments for financial instruments measured at amortized cost (e.g. mortgage loans or reinsurance recoverables) and requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure or pool of exposures. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical information, current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. The expected credit losses, and subsequent increases or decreases in such losses, will be recorded immediately through realized gains (losses) as an allowance that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, with the net carrying value of the financial asset presented on the balance sheet at the amount expected to be collected. The updated guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model for available for sale debt securities by requiring the recognition of impairments relating to credit losses through an allowance account and limits the amount of credit loss to the difference between a security's amortized cost basis and its fair value. Subsequent increases or decreases in expected credit losses will be\nrecorded immediately in the income statement through realized gains (losses). AFG will be required to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2020. AFG cannot estimate the impact that the updated guidance will have on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity until the updated guidance is adopted.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INDEX TO MD&A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Page\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Page\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Results of Operations - Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>49\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Overview\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segmented Statement of Earnings\n</td> <td>49\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Critical Accounting Policies\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Property and Casualty Insurance\n</td> <td>50\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annuity\n</td> <td>59\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratios\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Run-off Long-Term Care and Life\n</td> <td>66\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Holding Company, Other and Unallocated\n</td> <td>67\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parent and Subsidiary Liquidity\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Results of Operations - Full Year\n</td> <td>70\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Condensed Parent Only Cash Flows\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segmented Statement of Earnings\n</td> <td>70\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Property and Casualty Insurance\n</td> <td>72\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annuity\n</td> <td>82\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Run-off Long-Term Care and Life\n</td> <td>91\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertainties\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Holding Company, Other and Unallocated\n</td> <td>92\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Managed Investment Entities\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Recent and Pending Accounting Standards\n</td> <td>95\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Results of Operations\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGENERAL\nFollowing is a discussion and analysis of the financial statements and other statistical data that management believes will enhance the understanding of AFG's financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page.\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial Condition\nAFG is organized as a holding company with almost all of its operations being conducted by subsidiaries. AFG, however, has continuing cash needs for administrative expenses, the payment of principal and interest on borrowings, shareholder dividends, and taxes. Therefore, certain analyses are most meaningfully presented on a parent only basis while others are best done on a total enterprise basis. In addition, because most of its businesses are financial in nature, AFG does not prepare its consolidated financial statements using a current-noncurrent format. Consequently, certain traditional ratios and financial analysis tests are not meaningful.\nAt December 31, 2016, AFG (parent) held approximately $260 million in cash and securities and had $500 million available under a bank line of credit, which expires in June 2021.\nResults of Operations\nThrough the operations of its subsidiaries, AFG is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance, focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses, and in the sale of fixed and fixed-indexed annuities in the retail, financial institutions and education markets.\nFourth quarter 2016 net earnings attributable to AFG's shareholders were $385 million ($4.33 per share, diluted) compared to $129 million ($1.45 per share, diluted) in the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting:\n \u2022 higher underwriting profit and net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment, \n \u2022 higher earnings in the annuity segment, \n \u2022 the fourth quarter 2016 tax benefits from the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring, \n \u2022 the fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property, and \n \u2022 net realized gains on securities in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2015. \nFull year 2016 net earnings attributable to AFG's shareholders were $649 million ($7.33 per share, diluted) compared to $352 million ($3.94 per share, diluted) in 2015, reflecting:\n \u2022 higher underwriting profit and net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment, \n \u2022 higher earnings in the annuity segment, \n \u2022 lower profitability in the run-off long-term care and life segment, \n \u2022 net realized gains on securities in 2016 compared to net realized losses on securities in 2015, \n \u2022 the 2015 loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care business, \n \u2022 the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of an apartment property, which was less than the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of a hotel and the fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property, and \n \u2022 the fourth quarter 2016 tax benefits related to the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSignificant accounting policies are summarized in Note A - Accounting Policies\u201d to the financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements. As more information becomes known, these estimates and assumptions change and, thus, impact amounts reported in the future. The areas where management believes the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements is most significant are as follows:\n \u2022 the establishment of insurance reserves, especially asbestos and environmental-related reserves, \n \u2022 the recoverability of reinsurance, \n \u2022 the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs, \n \u2022 the establishment of asbestos and environmental reserves of former railroad and manufacturing operations, and \n \u2022 the valuation of investments, including the determination of other-than-temporary impairments. \nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Uncertainties\u201d for a discussion of insurance reserves, recoverables from reinsurers, and contingencies related to American Premier's former operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investments\u201d for a discussion of impairments on investments. Deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) and certain liabilities related to annuities are amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies. Assumptions considered in determining expected gross profits involve significant judgment and include management's estimates of interest rates and investment spreads, surrenders, annuitizations, renewal premiums and mortality. Should actual experience require management to change its assumptions (commonly referred to as unlocking\u201d), a charge or credit would be recorded to adjust DPAC or annuity liabilities to the levels they would have been if the new assumptions had been used from the inception date of each policy.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRatios AFG's debt to total capital ratio on a consolidated basis is shown below (dollars in millions). Management intends to maintain the ratio of debt to capital at or below 25% and intends to maintain the capital of its significant insurance subsidiaries at or above levels currently indicated by rating agencies as appropriate for the current ratings.

In addition, maintaining a ratio of debt, excluding subordinated debt and debt secured by real estate, to total capital of 35% or lower is a financial covenant in AFG's bank credit facility. The ratio is calculated by dividing the principal amount of AFG's long-term debt by its total capital, which includes long-term debt, noncontrolling interests and shareholders' equity (excluding unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity investments).\nAFG's ratio of earnings to fixed charges, including annuity benefits as a fixed charge, was 1.85 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding annuity benefits, this ratio was 8.62. Although the ratio excluding annuity benefits is not required or encouraged to be disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, it is presented because interest credited to annuity policyholder accounts is not always considered a borrowing cost for an insurance company.\nThe NAIC's model law for risk based capital ( RBC\u201d) applies to both life and property and casualty companies. RBC formulas determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs so that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired. At December 31, 2016, the capital ratios of all AFG insurance companies substantially exceeded the RBC requirements.\nCondensed Consolidated Cash Flows AFG's principal sources of cash include insurance premiums, income from its investment portfolio and proceeds from the maturities, redemptions and sales of investments. Insurance premiums in excess of acquisition expenses and operating costs are invested until they are needed to meet policyholder obligations or made available to the parent company through dividends to cover debt obligations and corporate expenses, and to provide returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as detailed in AFG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are shown below (in millions):\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(2,981\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,628\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>2,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities AFG's property and casualty insurance operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as premiums collected and investment income exceed policy acquisition costs, claims payments and operating expenses. AFG's net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by the level and timing of property and casualty premiums, claim and expense payments and recoveries from reinsurers. AFG's annuity operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as investment income exceeds acquisition costs and operating expenses. Interest credited on annuity policyholder funds is a non-cash increase in AFG's annuity benefits accumulated liability and annuity premiums, benefits and withdrawals are considered financing activities due to the deposit-type nature of annuities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.15 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.23 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities AFG's investing activities consist primarily of the investment of funds provided by its property and casualty and annuity products. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.98 billion in 2016 compared to $4.57 billion in 2015, a decrease of $1.59 billion. The $151 million decrease in net cash flows from annuity policyholders in 2016 as compared to 2015 (discussed below under net cash provided by financing activities) decreased the amount of cash available for investment in 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, AFG's cash on hand increased by $887 million during 2016, primarily in the property and casualty and annuity segments reflecting the timing of investing available cash in those segments. Investing activities also include the purchase and disposal of managed investment entity investments (collateralized loan obligations), which are presented separately in AFG's Balance Sheet. Net investment activity in the managed investment entities was a $364 million use of cash in 2016 compared to a $675 million use of cash in 2015, accounting for a $311 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $4.57 billion in 2015 compared to $3.63 billion in 2014, an increase of $945 million. The $537 million increase in net cash flows from annuity policyholders in 2015 as compared to 2014 increased the amount of cash available for investment in 2015 compared to 2014. Net investment activity in the managed investment entities was a $675 million use of cash in 2015 compared to a $275 million use of cash in 2014, accounting for a $400 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities AFG's financing activities consist primarily of transactions with annuity policyholders, issuances and retirements of long-term debt, repurchases of common stock and dividend payments. Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.72 billion in 2016 compared to $3.10 billion in 2015, a decrease of $379 million. Annuity receipts exceeded annuity surrenders, benefits, withdrawals and transfers by $2.35 billion in 2016 compared to $2.50 billion in 2015, resulting in a $151 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. AFG issued $300 million of 3.50% Senior Notes in 2016 and $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures in 2015, the\nnet proceeds of which contributed $296 million in 2016 and $145 million in 2015 to net cash provided by financing activities. Redemptions of long-term debt was an $18 million use of cash in 2016 and a $192 million use of cash in 2015. During 2016, AFG repurchased $133 million of its Common Stock compared to $126 million repurchased in 2015, which accounted for a $7 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2016, $315 million was used to fund the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in National Interstate Corporation. Financing activities also include issuances and retirements of managed investment entity liabilities, which are nonrecourse to AFG and presented separately in AFG's Balance Sheet. Issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $693 million in 2016 compared to $890 million in 2015, accounting for a $197 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3.10 billion in 2015 compared to $2.10 billion in 2014, an increase of $996 million. Annuity receipts exceeded annuity surrenders, benefits, withdrawals and transfers by $2.50 billion in 2015 compared to $1.97 billion in 2014, resulting in a $537 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities. Redemptions of long-term debt resulted in a $192 million use of cash in 2015. AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures in 2015 and $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures in 2014, the net proceeds of each issuance contributed $145 million to net cash provided by financing activities in those years. During 2015, AFG repurchased $126 million of its Common Stock compared to $191 million in 2014, which accounted for a $65 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014. Issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $890 million in 2015 compared to $306 million in 2014, accounting for a $584 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014.\nParent and Subsidiary Liquidity\nParent Holding Company Liquidity Management believes AFG has sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements. If funds generated from operations, including dividends, tax payments and borrowings from subsidiaries, are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period, AFG would be required to utilize parent company cash and marketable securities or to generate cash through borrowings, sales of other assets, or similar transactions.\nIn June 2016, AFG replaced its bank credit facility with a five-year, $500 million revolving credit line. Amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at rates ranging from 1.00% to 1.875% (currently 1.375%) over LIBOR based on AFG's credit rating. There were no borrowings under this agreement, or under any other parent company short-term borrowing arrangements, during 2016.\nOn November 10, 2016, AFG acquired the 49% of National Interstate Corporation ( NATL\u201d) not previously owned by AFG's wholly-owned subsidiary, Great American Insurance Company ( GAI\u201d) for $315 million ($32.00 per share) in cash in a merger transaction. In addition, NATL paid a one-time special cash dividend of $0.50 per share to its shareholders immediately prior to the merger closing ($5 million was paid to noncontrolling shareholders). See Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements.\nIn August 2016, AFG issued $300 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due 2026. AFG used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the acquisition of NATL mentioned above.\nDuring 2016, AFG repurchased 1.9 million shares of its Common Stock for $133 million. In December 2016, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $87 million.\nIn November 2015, AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures due 2055. In September 2015, AFG redeemed its $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050 at par using cash on hand at the parent company.\nDuring 2015, AFG repurchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock for $126 million. In December 2015, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million.\nIn April 2014, AFG completed the purchase of Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and its related companies ( Summit\u201d) from Liberty Mutual Insurance for $259 million using cash on hand at the parent company. In addition, AFG made a capital contribution of approximately $140 million, bringing its capital investment in the Summit business to $399 million. Summit's results of operations are included in AFG's consolidated results beginning in April of 2014.\nIn September 2014, AFG issued $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures due 2054. During 2014, AFG repurchased 3.3 million shares of its Common Stock for $191 million. In December 2014, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million.\nAll debentures and notes issued by AFG are rated investment grade by two nationally recognized rating agencies. Under a currently effective shelf registration statement, AFG can offer additional equity or debt securities. The shelf registration provides AFG with flexibility to access the capital markets from time to time as market and other conditions permit.\nUnder a tax allocation agreement with AFG, its 80%-owned U.S. subsidiaries generally pay taxes to (or recover taxes from) AFG based on each subsidiary's contribution to amounts due under AFG's consolidated tax return.\nSubsidiary Liquidity Great American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC\u201d), a wholly-owned annuity subsidiary, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati ( FHLB\u201d). The FHLB makes advances and provides other banking services to member institutions, which provides the annuity operations with an additional source of liquidity. These advances further the FHLB's mission of improving access to housing by increasing liquidity in the residential mortgage-backed securities market. At December 31, 2016, GALIC had $935 million in outstanding advances from the FHLB (included in annuity benefits accumulated), bearing interest at rates ranging from 0.03% to 0.53% over LIBOR (average rate of 1.18% at December 31, 2016). In the fourth quarter of 2016, GALIC extended the terms on advances totaling $200 million by four years. While these advances must be repaid between 2018 and 2021 ($285 million in 2018, $500 million in 2020 and $150 million in 2021), GALIC has the option to prepay all or a portion of the advances. GALIC has invested the proceeds from the advances in fixed maturity securities with similar expected lives as the advances for the purpose of earning a spread over the interest payments due to the FHLB. At December 31, 2016, GALIC estimated that it had additional borrowing capacity of approximately $300 million from the FHLB.\nThe liquidity requirements of AFG's insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and expenses, payments of dividends and taxes to AFG and contributions of capital to their subsidiaries. Historically, cash flows from premiums and investment income have generally provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements. Funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities. In addition, the insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid, short-term investments.\nThe excess cash flow of AFG's property and casualty group allows it to extend the duration of its investment portfolio somewhat beyond that of its claim reserves.\nIn the annuity business, where profitability is largely dependent on earning a spread between invested assets and annuity liabilities, the duration of investments is generally maintained close to that of liabilities. In a rising interest rate environment, significant protection from withdrawals exists in the form of temporary and permanent surrender charges on AFG's annuity products. With declining rates, AFG receives some protection (from spread compression) due to the ability to lower crediting rates, subject to contractually guaranteed minimum interest rates ( GMIRs\u201d). AFG began selling policies with GMIRs below 2% in 2003; almost all new business since late 2010 has been issued with a 1% GMIR. At December 31, 2016, AFG could reduce the average crediting rate on approximately $22 billion of traditional fixed and fixed-indexed annuities without guaranteed withdrawal benefits by approximately 80 basis points (on a weighted average basis). Annuity policies are subject to GMIRs at policy issuance. The table below shows the breakdown of annuity reserves by GMIR. The current interest crediting rates on substantially all of AFG's annuities with a GMIR of 3% or higher are at their minimum.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>at December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>GMIR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>1 - 1.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2 - 2.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>3 - 3.99%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>4.00% and above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Annuity benefits accumulated (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$29,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG's weighted average cost of funds for newly issued traditional fixed and fixed-indexed annuities was 2.28% for 2016 compared to 2.31% for 2015. In the first half of 2016, AFG lowered the crediting rates on new annuity sales due to the decline in market investment yields experienced during that period. Conversely, AFG raised crediting rates on new annuity sales in the\nlatter part of 2016 in response to rising market investment yields. In addition to lowering the cost of funds, AFG reduced certain commission rates and guaranteed withdrawal benefits on annuities sold in 2016.\nFor statutory accounting purposes, equity securities of non-affiliates and equity call options used in the fixed-indexed annuity business are generally carried at fair value. At December 31, 2016, AFG's insurance companies owned publicly traded equity securities with a fair value of $1.51 billion and equity call options with a fair value of $492 million. Decreases in market prices could adversely affect the insurance group's capital, potentially impacting the amount of dividends available or necessitating a capital contribution. Conversely, increases in market prices could have a favorable impact on the group's dividend-paying capability.\nAFG believes its insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and benefits and operating expenses. In addition, these subsidiaries have sufficient capital to meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies, inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies. Nonetheless, changes in statutory accounting rules, significant declines in the fair value of the insurance subsidiaries' investment portfolios or significant ratings downgrades on these investments, could create a need for additional capital.\nCondensed Parent Only Cash Flows AFG's parent holding company only condensed cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are shown below (in millions):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(560\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(232\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(231\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nParent Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Parent holding company cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of dividends and tax payments received from AFG's insurance subsidiaries, reduced by tax payments to the IRS and holding company interest and other expenses. Parent holding company net cash provided by operating activities was $555 million in 2016 compared to $162 million in 2015 and $372 million in 2014. Higher dividends received from subsidiaries in 2016 as compared to 2015 were the primary driver of the $393 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities. The $210 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily the result of lower dividends received.\nParent Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Parent holding company investing activities consist of capital contributions to and returns of capital from subsidiaries and, to a much lesser extent, parent company investment activity. Parent holding company net cash used in investing activities was $560 million in 2016 compared to $33 million in 2015 and $432 million in 2014. The $560 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 as compared to the $33 million in 2015 is significantly higher due primarily to increased capital contributions to a subsidiary to fund the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in National Interstate Corporation. The $33 million of parent holding company net cash used in investing activities in 2015 was significantly lower than the $432 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 due primarily to capital contributions made to a subsidiary to fund the $399 million investment in Summit in 2014.\nParent Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Parent company financing activities consist primarily of repurchases of AFG Common Stock, dividends to shareholders, the issuance and retirement of long-term debt and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Significant long-term debt and common stock transactions are discussed above under Parent Holding Company Liquidity.\u201d Parent holding company net cash provided by financing activities was $13 million in 2016 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $232 million in 2015 and $171 million in 2014. The $245 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflects proceeds from additional long-term borrowings. The $61 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 reflects the 2015 redemption of $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050, partially offset by a $65 million decrease in common stock repurchases.\nContractual Obligations The following table shows an estimate (based on historical patterns and expected trends) of payments to be made for insurance reserve liabilities, as well as scheduled payments for major contractual obligations (in millions).

These assumptions also include interest and index crediting consistent with assumptions used to amortize DPAC and assess loss recognition. All estimated cash payments are undiscounted for the time value of money. As a result, total outflows for all years exceed the corresponding liabilities of $29.91 billion for annuity benefits accumulated and $691 million for life, accident and health reserves included in AFG's Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. Based on the same assumptions, AFG projects reinsurance recoveries related to life, accident and health reserves totaling $769 million as follows: Within 1 year - $81 million; 2-3 years - $129 million; 4-5 years - $110 million; and thereafter - $449 million. Actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates. \n (b) Dollar amounts and time periods are estimates based on historical net payment patterns applied to the gross reserves and do not represent actual contractual obligations. Based on the same assumptions, AFG projects reinsurance recoveries related to these reserves totaling $2.30 billion as follows: Within 1 year - $600 million; 2-3 years - $600 million; 4-5 years - $300 million; and thereafter - $800 million. Actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates. \nAFG has no material contractual purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements See Note P - Additional Information - Financial Instruments - Unfunded Commitments\u201d to the financial statements.\nInvestments AFG attempts to optimize investment income while building the value of its portfolio, placing emphasis upon total long-term performance.\nAFG's investment portfolio at December 31, 2016, contained $34.54 billion in fixed maturity securities and $1.50 billion in equity securities classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in a separate component of shareholders' equity on an after-tax basis. In addition, $359 million in fixed maturities and $56 million in equity securities were classified as trading with changes in unrealized holding gains or losses included in net investment income.\nAs detailed in Note E - Investments - Net Unrealized Gain on Marketable Securities\u201d to the financial statements, unrealized gains and losses on AFG's fixed maturity and equity securities are included in shareholders' equity after adjustments for related changes in DPAC and certain liabilities related to annuity, long-term care and life businesses, noncontrolling interests and deferred income taxes. DPAC and certain other balance sheet amounts applicable to annuity, long-term care and life businesses are adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses had been realized, with corresponding increases or decreases (net of tax) included in accumulated other comprehensive income in AFG's Balance Sheet.\nFixed income investment funds are generally invested in securities with intermediate-term maturities with an objective of optimizing total return while allowing flexibility to react to changes in market conditions. At December 31, 2016, the average life of AFG's fixed maturities was about 6-1/2 years.\nFair values for AFG's portfolio are determined by AFG's internal investment professionals using data from nationally recognized pricing services as well as non-binding broker quotes. Fair values of equity securities are generally based on published closing prices. For mortgage-backed securities ( MBS\u201d), which comprise approximately 15% of AFG's fixed maturities, prices for each security are generally obtained from both pricing services and broker quotes. For the remainder of AFG's fixed maturity portfolio, approximately 79% are priced using pricing services and the balance is priced primarily by\nusing non-binding broker quotes. When prices obtained for the same security vary, AFG's internal investment professionals select the price they believe is most indicative of an exit price.\nThe pricing services use a variety of observable inputs to estimate fair value of fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis. Based upon information provided by the pricing services, these inputs include, but are not limited to, recent reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids or offers, reference data, and measures of volatility. Included in the pricing of MBS are estimates of the rate of future prepayments and defaults of principal over the remaining life of the underlying collateral. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on brokers' prices are classified as Level 3 in the GAAP hierarchy unless the price can be corroborated, for example, by comparison to similar securities priced using observable inputs.\nValuation techniques utilized by pricing services and prices obtained from external sources are reviewed by AFG's internal investment professionals who are familiar with the securities being priced and the markets in which they trade to ensure the fair value determination is representative of an exit price. To validate the appropriateness of the prices obtained, these investment managers consider widely published indices (as benchmarks), recent trades, changes in interest rates, general economic conditions and the credit quality of the specific issuers. In addition, AFG communicates directly with pricing services regarding the methods and assumptions used in pricing, including verifying, on a test basis, the inputs used by the services to value specific securities.\nIn general, the fair value of AFG's fixed maturity investments is inversely correlated to changes in interest rates. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of such fair values to reasonably likely changes in interest rates by illustrating the estimated effect on AFG's fixed maturity portfolio and accumulated other comprehensive income that an immediate increase of 100 basis points in the interest rate yield curve would have at December 31, 2016 (dollars in millions). Effects of increases or decreases from the 100 basis points illustrated would be approximately proportional.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of fixed maturity portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage impact on fair value of 100 bps increase in interest rates\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pretax impact on fair value of fixed maturity portfolio\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,745\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offsetting adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs and other balance sheet amounts\n</td> <td>700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated pretax impact on accumulated other comprehensive income\n</td> <td>(1,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated after-tax impact on accumulated other comprehensive income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(679\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nApproximately 89% of the fixed maturities held by AFG at December 31, 2016, were rated investment grade\u201d (credit rating of AAA to BBB) by nationally recognized rating agencies. Investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated and non-investment grade. Management believes that the high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return.\nMBS are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that, in periods of declining interest rates, mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates. Although interest rates have been low in recent years, tighter lending standards have resulted in fewer buyers being able to refinance the mortgages underlying much of AFG's non-agency residential MBS portfolio.\nSummarized information for AFG's MBS (including those classified as trading) at December 31, 2016, is shown in the table below (dollars in millions). Agency-backed securities are those issued by a U.S. government-backed agency; Alt-A mortgages are those with risk profiles between prime and subprime. The average life of the residential and commercial MBS is approximately 4-1/2 years and 4 years, respectively.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value as\n% of Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unrealized\nGain (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Rated\nInvestment\nGrade\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateral type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency-backed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-agency prime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alt-A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subprime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC\u201d) assigns creditworthiness designations on a scale of 1 to 6 with 1 being the highest quality and 6 being the lowest quality. The NAIC retains third-party investment management firms to assist in the determination of appropriate NAIC designations for mortgage-backed securities based not only on the probability of loss (which is the primary basis of ratings by the major ratings firms), but also on the severity of loss and statutory carrying value. At December 31, 2016, 97% (based on statutory carrying value of $4.75 billion) of AFG's MBS had an NAIC designation of 1.\nMunicipal bonds represented approximately 19% of AFG's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2016. AFG's municipal bond portfolio is high quality, with 98% of the securities rated investment grade at that date. The portfolio is well diversified across the states of issuance and individual issuers. At December 31, 2016, approximately 76% of the municipal bond portfolio was held in revenue bonds, with the remaining 24% held in general obligation bonds. General obligation securities of California, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Puerto Rico collectively represented approximately 1% of this portfolio.\nSummarized information for the unrealized gains and losses recorded in AFG's Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016, is shown in the following table (dollars in millions).

a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, a provision for impairment is charged to earnings (accounted for as a realized loss) and the cost basis of that investment is reduced by the amount of the charge. The determination of whether unrealized losses are other-than-temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors. Factors considered and resources used by management include:\n a) whether the unrealized loss is credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates, \n b) the extent to which fair value is less than cost basis, \n c) cash flow projections received from independent sources, \n d) historical operating, balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer SEC filings and news releases, \n e) near-term prospects for improvement in the issuer and/or its industry, \n f) third party research and communications with industry specialists, \n g) financial models and forecasts, \n h) the continuity of dividend payments, maintenance of investment grade ratings and hybrid nature of certain investments, \n i) discussions with issuer management, and \n j) ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value. \nBased on its analysis of the factors listed above, management believes AFG will recover its cost basis in the securities with unrealized losses and that AFG has the ability to hold the securities until they recover in value and had no intent to sell them at December 31, 2016. Although AFG has the ability to continue holding its investments with unrealized losses, its intent to hold them may change due to deterioration in the issuers' creditworthiness, decisions to lessen exposure to a particular issuer or industry, asset/liability management decisions, market movements, changes in views about appropriate asset allocation or the desire to offset taxable realized gains. Should AFG's ability or intent change with regard to a particular security, a charge for impairment would likely be required. While it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired, charges for other-than-temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in future periods. Significant declines in the fair value of AFG's investment portfolio could have a significant adverse effect on AFG's liquidity. For information on AFG's realized gains (losses) on securities, including charges for other-than-temporary impairment, see Results of Operations - Consolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities.\u201d\nUncertainties As more fully explained in the following paragraphs, management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and contingencies arising out of its former railroad and manufacturing operations.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves Estimating the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors that are subject to significant variation. Determining the liability is a complex process incorporating input from many areas of the Company including actuarial, underwriting, pricing, claims and operations management.\nThe estimates of liabilities for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based upon: (i) the accumulation of case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting periods on direct business written ( case reserves\u201d); (ii) estimates received from ceding reinsurers and insurance pools and associations; (iii) estimates of claims incurred but not reported or IBNR\u201d (including possible development on known claims); (iv) estimates (based on experience) of expense for investigating and adjusting claims; and (v) the current state of law and coverage litigation.\nThe process used to determine the total reserve for liabilities involves estimating the ultimate incurred losses and LAE, adjusted for amounts already paid on the claims. The IBNR reserve is derived by first estimating the ultimate unpaid reserve liability and subtracting case reserves for loss and LAE. See Note O - Insurance - Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of the factors considered and actuarial methods used in determining management's best estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and LAE.\nThe following table shows (in millions) the breakdown of AFG's property and casualty reserves between case reserves, IBNR reserves and LAE reserves (estimated amounts required to adjust, record and settle claims, other than the claim payments themselves).\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Loss Reserves at December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Case\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IBNR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nReserve\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statutory Line of Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liability - occurrence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liability - claims made\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>576\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial auto/truck liability/medical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special property (fire, allied lines, inland marine, earthquake)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Products liability - occurrence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial multi-peril\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>245\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Statutory Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments for GAAP:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves of foreign operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>801\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred gains on retroactive reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss reserve discounting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Adjustments for GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total GAAP Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile current factors and reasonably likely changes in variable factors are considered in estimating the liability for unpaid losses, there is no method or system that can eliminate the risk of actual ultimate results differing from such estimates.\nFollowing is a discussion of certain critical variables affecting the estimation of loss reserves of the more significant long-tail lines of business (asbestos and environmental liabilities are separately discussed below). Many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs.\nAn important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future. However, future results could vary due to an unexpected change in the underlying cost trends. This unexpected change could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation, inflation from social programs, new medical technologies, or other factors such as those listed below in connection with AFG's largest lines of business. It is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these variables, and future cost trends could be partially impacted by several such variables. However, it is reasonable to address the sensitivity of the reserves to potential impact from changes in these variables by measuring the effect of a possible overall 1% change in future cost trends that may be caused by one or more variables. Utilizing the effect of a 1% change in overall cost trends enables changes greater than 1% to be estimated by extrapolation. Each additional 1% change in the cost trend would increase the effect on net earnings by an amount slightly (about 5%) greater than the effect of the previous 1%. For example, if a 1% change in cost trends in a line of business would change net earnings by $20 million, a 2% change would change net earnings by approximately $41 million.\nThe estimated cumulative impact that a 1% change in cost trends in AFG's more significant lines of property and casualty business (exceeding 5% of total reserves) would have on net earnings is shown below (in millions).

The following table shows (dollars in millions) what the impact on AFG's net earnings would be on the more significant lines of business if the December 31, 2016, reserves (net of reinsurance) developed at the same rate as the average development of the most recent five years.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5-yr.

Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for workers' compensation include:\n \u2022 Legislative actions and regulatory and legal interpretations \n \u2022 Future medical cost inflation \n \u2022 Economic conditions \n \u2022 Timing of claims reporting \n \u2022 Medical advances and changes to life expectancies \nIn April 2014, AFG acquired Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and related companies, a leading provider of workers' compensation solutions in the southeastern United States. The Summit acquisition significantly increased AFG's volume of workers' compensation business and improved its geographic diversity. Approximately 24% and 18% of AFG's workers' compensation reserves at December 31, 2016 relate to policies written in Florida and California, respectively. Over the past 13 years in both states, there have been numerous revisions to workers' compensation regulations and operating environments, adding difficulty and uncertainty to the estimation of related liabilities.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $85 million in 2016 due to lower than anticipated claim severity and improving claim closure rates. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $45 million in 2015 due to lower than anticipated claim severity across all regions of the country. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in 2014, as favorable reserve development in the business written in California was partially offset by adverse reserve development in other states.\nOther Liability - Occurrence\nThis long-tail line of business consists of coverages protecting the insured against legal liability resulting from negligence, carelessness, or a failure to act causing property damage or personal injury to others. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability - occurrence include:\n \u2022 Litigious climate \n \u2022 Unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues \n \u2022 Magnitude of jury awards \n \u2022 Outside counsel costs \n \u2022 Timing of claims reporting \nAFG recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $61 million in 2016 related to its other liability - occurrence coverage due primarily to increased severity in New York contractor claims. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in 2015 and $15 million in 2014 as both the frequency and severity of claims in excess and umbrella liability coverages were lower than previously projected.\nWhile management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above, more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held. For recent accident years, more weight is given to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.\nCommercial Auto/Truck Liability/Medical\nThis line of business is a mix of coverage protecting the insured against legal liability for property damage or personal injury to others arising from the operation of commercial motor vehicles. The property damage liability exposure is usually short-tail with relatively quick reporting and settlement of claims. The bodily injury and medical payments exposures are longer-tailed; although the claim reporting is relatively quick, the final settlement can take longer to achieve. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto/truck liability/medical are similar to other liability - occurrence and include:\n \u2022 Magnitude of jury awards \n \u2022 Unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues \n \u2022 Litigious climate and trends \n \u2022 Change in frequency of severe accidents \n \u2022 Health care costs and utilization of medical services by injured parties \nAFG recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $28 million in 2016, $20 million in 2015 and $28 million in 2014 for this line of business as claim severity has been significantly higher than expected in accident years 2010 and subsequent.\nOther Liability - Claims Made\nThis long-tail line of business consists mostly of directors' and officers' liability ( D&O\u201d). Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability - claims made include:\n \u2022 Litigious climate \n \u2022 Economic conditions \n \u2022 Variability of stock prices \n \u2022 Magnitude of jury awards \nThe general state of the economy and the variability of the stock price of the insured can affect the frequency and severity of shareholder class action suits and other situations that trigger coverage under D&O policies. For example, from 2008 to 2010, economic conditions led to higher frequency of claims, particularly in the D&O policies for small account and not-for-profit organizations. Since then, claim frequency has continually decreased from its peak in 2010, offsetting increased claim severity.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $24 million in 2016, $12 million in 2015 and $18 million in 2014 on its D&O business as claim severity was less than expected across several prior accident years.\nReserves of Foreign Operations\nReserves of foreign operations relate primarily to the operations of Neon Underwriting Limited ( Neon\u201d), AFG's wholly-owned United Kingdom-based Lloyd's insurer. Historically, the largest line of business written by Neon was non-U.S. medical malpractice, which provides coverage for injuries and damages caused by medical care providers, including but not limited to, hospitals and their physicians. Although Neon offered this product in approximately 30 countries, the majority of the business has been written in the United Kingdom, Australia and Italy. In addition, Neon writes marine, equine, professional indemnity, directors and officers liability, catastrophe and cyber insurance and previously offered general liability policies. Significant variables in estimating the loss reserves include:\n \u2022 Litigious environment \n \u2022 Magnitude of court awards \n \u2022 A slow moving judicial system including varying approaches to medical malpractice claims among courts \n \u2022 Trends in claim costs, including medical cost inflation \nDuring the second quarter of 2016, Neon completed a strategic review of its business under a new leadership team. As part of its strategic review, Neon sold and/or exited certain historical lines of business including its medical malpractice and general liability classes. As a result of Neon's claims review of its exited lines of business, AFG recorded a charge of approximately $65 million, including $57 million to increase loss reserves (adverse development) primarily related to its medical malpractice and general liability lines. In addition to the exited lines charge, Neon recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $21 million in 2016, $44 million in 2015 and $14 million in 2014. The adverse development in 2016 outside of the exited lines charge was attributable to reserve strengthening in several lines of business, including political risk and personal accident. The adverse development in 2015 and 2014 was attributable to reserve strengthening in several lines of business, primarily Dutch hospital medical malpractice, Australian and other general liability and personal accident insurance.\nRecoverables from Reinsurers and Availability of Reinsurance AFG is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers, as reinsurance contracts do not relieve AFG of its liability to policyholders. To mitigate this risk, substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade S&P ratings or is secured by funds withheld\u201d or other collateral.\nThe availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, which are beyond AFG's control and which may affect AFG's level of business and profitability. Although the cost of certain reinsurance programs may increase, management believes that AFG will be able to maintain adequate reinsurance coverage at acceptable rates without a material adverse effect on AFG's results of operations. AFG's gross and net combined ratios are shown in the table below.\nSee Item 1 - Business - Property and Casualty Insurance Segment - Reinsurance\u201d for more information on AFG's reinsurance programs. For additional information on the effect of reinsurance on AFG's historical results of operations see Note O - Insurance - Reinsurance\u201d to the financial statements.\nThe following table illustrates the effect that purchasing property and casualty reinsurance has had on AFG's combined ratio over the last three years.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Before reinsurance (gross)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual (net of reinsurance)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutside of its property and casualty operations, AFG also has reinsurance recoverables totaling $343 million, including $296 million related to the run-off life business. These recoverables include $254 million directly or indirectly from Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America (rated A+ by A.M. Best).\nAsbestos and Environmental-related ( A&E\u201d) Insurance Reserves Asbestos and environmental reserves of the property and casualty group consisted of the following (in millions):\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A&E reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance recoverable, net of allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross A&E reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsbestos reserves include claims asserting alleged injuries and damages from exposure to asbestos. Environmental reserves include claims relating to polluted sites.\nAsbestos claims against manufacturers, distributors or installers of asbestos products were presented under the products liability section of their policies, which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer's liability. In recent years, a number of asbestos claims are being presented as non-products\u201d claims, such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property, under the premises or operations section of their policies. Unlike products exposures, these non-products exposures typically had no aggregate limits, creating potentially greater exposure for insurers. Further, in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage, some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non-products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non-products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits. AFG, along with other insurers, is and will be subject to such non-products claims. It is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non-products coverage or whether AFG and other insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses. Therefore, the future impact of such efforts is uncertain.\nApproximately 41% of AFG's net asbestos reserves relate to policies written directly by AFG subsidiaries. Claims from these policies generally are product-oriented claims with only a limited amount of non-products exposures, and are dominated by small to mid-sized commercial entities that are mostly regional policyholders with few national target defendants. The remainder is assumed reinsurance business that includes exposures for the periods 1954 to 1983. The asbestos and environmental assumed claims are ceded by various insurance companies under reinsurance treaties. A majority of the individual assumed claims have exposures of less than $100,000 to AFG. Asbestos losses assumed include some of the industry known manufacturers, distributors and installers. Pollution losses include industry known insured names and sites.\nEstablishing reserves for A&E claims relating to policies and participations in reinsurance treaties and former operations is subject to uncertainties that are significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims. For this group of claims, traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical loss development trends cannot be used and a range of reasonably possible losses cannot be estimated. Case reserves and expense reserves are established by the claims department as specific policies are identified. In addition to the case reserves established for known claims, management establishes additional reserves for claims not yet known or reported and for possible development on known claims. These additional reserves are management's best estimate based on periodic comprehensive studies and internal reviews adjusted for payments and identifiable changes, supplemented by management's review of industry information about such claims, with due consideration to individual claim situations.\nManagement believes that estimating the ultimate liability for asbestos claims presents a unique and difficult challenge to the insurance industry due to, among other things, inconsistent court decisions, an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos-related liabilities, novel theories of coverage, and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage. The casualty insurance industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues as the volume and severity of claims against asbestos defendants continue to increase. Environmental claims likewise present challenges in prediction, due to uncertainty regarding the interpretation of insurance policies, complexities regarding multi-party involvements at sites, evolving cleanup standards and protracted time periods required to assess the level of cleanup required at contaminated sites.\nThe following factors could impact AFG's reserves and payments:\n \u2022 There is a growing interest at the state level to attempt to legislatively address asbestos liabilities and the manner in which asbestos claims are resolved. These developments are fluid and could result in piecemeal state-by-state solutions. \n \u2022 The manner by which bankruptcy courts are addressing asbestos liabilities is in flux. \n \u2022 AFG's insureds may make claims alleging significant non-products exposures. \nWhile management believes that AFG's reserves for A&E claims are a reasonable estimate of ultimate liability for such claims, actual results may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded due to the difficulty in predicting the number of future claims, the impact of recent bankruptcy filings, and unresolved issues such as whether coverage exists, whether policies are subject to aggregate limits on coverage, how claims are to be allocated among triggered policies and implicated years, and whether claimants who exhibit no signs of illness will be successful in pursuing their claims. A 1% variation in loss cost trends, caused by any of the factors previously described, would change net income by approximately $20 million.\nAFG tracks its A&E claims by policyholder. The following table shows, by type of claim, the number of policyholders that did not receive any payments in the calendar year separate from policyholders that did receive a payment. Policyholder counts represent policies written by AFG subsidiaries and do not include assumed reinsurance.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of policyholders with no indemnity payments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of policyholders with indemnity payments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmounts paid (net of reinsurance recoveries) for asbestos and environmental claims, including loss adjustment expenses, were as follows (in millions):\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe survival ratio is a measure often used by industry analysts to compare A&E reserves strength among companies. This ratio is typically calculated by dividing reserves for A&E exposures by the three-year average of paid losses, and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to pay off current reserves based on recent average payments. Because this ratio can be significantly impacted by a number of factors such as loss payout variability, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy based simply on the survival ratio. At December 31, 2016, the property and casualty insurance segment's three-year survival ratios compare favorably with industry survival ratios published by A.M. Best (as of December 31, 2015) as detailed in the following table: Table 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three-Year Survival Ratio (% Times Paid Losses)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asbestos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total A&E\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AFG (12/31/2016)\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industry (12/31/2015)\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG has periodically conducted comprehensive external studies of its asbestos and environmental exposures relating to the run-off operations of its property and casualty insurance segment and exposures related to its former railroad and manufacturing operations with the aid of specialty actuarial, engineering and consulting firms and outside counsel, generally every two years, with an in-depth internal review during the intervening years.\nAn in-depth internal review of AFG's A&E reserves was completed in the third quarter of 2016 by AFG's internal A&E claims specialists and actuaries in consultation with specialty outside counsel and an outside consultant. As a result of the review, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $36 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by\n$5 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $31 million (net of reinsurance). Over the past few years, the focus of AFG's asbestos claims litigation has shifted to smaller companies and companies with ancillary exposures. AFG's insureds with these exposures have been the driver of the property and casualty insurance segment's asbestos reserve increases in recent years. AFG is seeing modestly increasing estimates for indemnity and defense compared to prior studies. Overall, the rate of new asbestos cases received is down modestly. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was primarily associated with updated estimates of site investigation costs with respect to existing sites and newly identified sites. AFG is seeing increased legal defense costs in environmental claims generally, as well as a number of claims and sites where the estimated investigation and remediation costs have increased. As in past years, there were no new or emerging broad industry trends that were identified in the review.\nAs a result of the comprehensive external study completed in the third quarter of 2015, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $67 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $25 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $42 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in property and casualty asbestos reserves was attributed to increased estimates for indemnity and defense costs. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nAs a result of the in-depth internal review completed in the third quarter of 2014, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $24 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $4 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $20 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to AFG's increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nContingencies related to Subsidiaries' Former Operations The A&E studies and reviews discussed above encompassed reserves for various environmental and occupational injury and disease claims and other contingencies arising out of the railroad operations disposed of by American Premier's predecessor and certain manufacturing operations disposed of by American Premier and its subsidiaries and by Great American Financial Resources, Inc. Charges resulting from the A&E study and reviews were $5 million in 2016, $12 million in 2015 and $6 million in 2014. For a discussion of the charges recorded for those operations, see Holding Company, Other and Unallocated - Results of Operations.\u201d Liabilities for claims and contingencies arising from these former railroad and manufacturing operations totaled $86 million at December 31, 2016. For a discussion of the uncertainties in determining the ultimate liability, see Note M - Contingencies\u201d to the financial statements.\nRun-off Long-term Care Insurance In December 2015, AFG completed the sale of United Teacher Associates Insurance Company and Continental General Insurance Company, the legal entities containing substantially all of its run-off long-term care insurance business, to HC2 Holdings, Inc. ( HC2\u201d) for approximately $13 million in net proceeds. AFG may also receive up to $13 million of additional proceeds from HC2 in the future contingent upon the release of certain statutory-basis liabilities of the legal entities sold by AFG. In connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction, AFG agreed to provide up to an aggregate of $35 million of capital support for the insurance companies, on an as-needed basis to maintain specified surplus levels, subject to immediate reimbursement by HC2 through a five-year capital maintenance agreement. With the completion of this sale, AFG divested substantially all of its long-term care business (96% as measured by net statutory reserves as of November 30, 2015) and retained only a small block of long-term care insurance (1,600 policies) with approximately $37 million of reserves at December 31, 2016. AFG will continue to service and accept renewal premiums on its remaining outstanding policies, which are guaranteed renewable.\nMANAGED INVESTMENT ENTITIES\nAccounting standards require AFG to consolidate its investments in collateralized loan obligation ( CLO\u201d) entities that it manages and owns an interest in (in the form of debt). See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements. The effect of consolidating these entities is shown in the tables below (in millions).

holders to noncontrolling interests. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral AFG's net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. For example, core net operating earnings excludes realized gains (losses) on securities because such gains and losses are influenced significantly by financial markets, interest rates and the timing of sales. Similarly, significant gains and losses from the sale of real estate are excluded from core earnings as they are influenced by the timing of sales and realized gains (losses) and significant tax benefits (charges) related to subsidiaries are excluded because such gains and losses are largely the result of the changing business strategy and market opportunities. In addition, special charges related to coverage that AFG no longer writes, such as the Neon exited lines and for asbestos and environmental exposures are excluded from core earnings. The following table (in millions, except per share amounts) identifies non-core items and reconciles net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure. AFG believes core net operating earnings is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends and for management to evaluate financial performance against historical results because it believes this provides a more comparable measure of its continuing business.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

primarily to the fourth quarter 2016 tax benefits related to the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring, net realized gains on securities in the 2016 period compared to net realized losses on securities in the 2015 period and higher core net operating earnings. Core net operating earnings increased $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 reflecting higher operating earnings in the property and casualty and annuity segments.\nNet earnings attributable to shareholders increased $297 million for the full-year of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to the 2016 tax benefits related to the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring, lower special A&E charges recorded in 2016 compared to 2015, net realized gains on securities in 2016 compared to net realized losses on securities in 2015, the estimated loss on the sale of the subsidiaries containing substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015 and higher core net operating earnings, partially offset by a charge related to the exit of certain lines of business within Neon, and lower gains on the sale of real estate in 2016 compared to 2015. Core net operating earnings increased $48 million in 2016 compared to 2015 reflecting higher underwriting profit and net investment income in the ongoing property and casualty insurance operations and higher earnings in the annuity segment, partially offset by lower profitability in the run-off long-term care and life segment and higher holding company expenses.\nNet earnings attributable to shareholders decreased $100 million for the full-year of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to the loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business, higher special A&E charges and net realized losses on securities in 2015 compared to net realized gains on securities in 2014, partially offset by the gain on the sale of a hotel and an apartment property and higher core net operating earnings. Core net operating earnings increased $47 million for the full-year of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to higher underwriting profit and higher net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment and improved core operating results in the run-off long-term care and life segment.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015\nSegmented Statement of Earnings AFG reports its business as four segments: (i) Property and casualty insurance ( P&C\u201d), (ii) Annuity, (iii) Run-off long-term care and life and (iv) Other, which includes holding company costs and income and expenses related to the managed investment entities ( MIEs\u201d).\nAFG's net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. The following tables for the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 identify such items by segment and reconcile net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure that AFG believes is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends (in millions):\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>P&C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annuity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Run-off long-term care and life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consol.

tax and noncontrolling interest impacts of these reconciling items. \nProperty and Casualty Insurance Segment - Results of Operations Performance measures such as underwriting profit or loss and related combined ratios are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance. Underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio, which is a sum of the ratios of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and commissions and other underwriting expenses to premiums. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. The combined ratio does not reflect net investment income, other income, other expenses or federal income taxes.\nAFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $182 million in GAAP pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $179 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $3 million (2%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $182 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of\n$18 million (11%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit in the Property and transportation and Specialty financial insurance sub-segments and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty sub-segment. GAAP earnings also includes a $15 million pretax gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty insurance operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross written premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance premiums ceded\n</td> <td>(358\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(300\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net written premiums\n</td> <td>1,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in unearned premiums\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earned premiums\n</td> <td>1,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and other underwriting expenses\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting gain\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses, net (*)\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pretax non-core gain on sale of apartment property\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(*) Excludes the $15 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined Ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>90.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate - including exited lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>90.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFG's combined ratio has been better than the industry average for 29 of the last 31 years. Management believes that AFG's insurance operations have performed better than the industry as a result of its specialty niche focus, product line diversification, stringent underwriting discipline and alignment of compensation incentives.\nAFG reports the underwriting performance of its Specialty property and casualty insurance business in the following sub-segments: (i) Property and transportation, (ii) Specialty casualty and (iii) Specialty financial.\nTo understand the overall profitability of particular lines, the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered. Certain short-tail\u201d lines of business (primarily property coverages) generally have quick loss payouts, which reduce the time funds are held, thereby limiting investment income earned thereon.

Overall average renewal rates were up 1% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nProperty and transportation Gross written premiums increased $62 million (12%) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was due primarily to higher year-over-year gross written premiums in the crop business. Excluding crop, gross written premiums were comparable to the prior year period. Average renewal rates increased approximately 2% for this group in the fourth quarter of 2016, including a 4% increase in National Interstate's renewal rates. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 5 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting higher cessions in the crop business, primarily related to growth in a rainfall-related product, which is heavily reinsured.\nSpecialty casualty Gross written premiums increased $23 million (3%) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Higher gross written premiums in the targeted markets and executive liability businesses were partially offset by lower premiums in the excess and surplus lines operations, primarily the result of more stringent underwriting standards related to New York contractors business, as well as lower premiums within the workers' compensation businesses. Average renewal rates for this group were flat in the fourth quarter of 2016, and include a decrease of approximately 2% in the workers' compensation business. Excluding the workers' compensation business, average renewal rates for this group increased approximately 1% during the quarter. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 1 percentage point for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting a change in the mix of business.\nSpecialty financial Gross written premiums increased $1 million (1%) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to growth in the fidelity and crime, surety and equipment leasing businesses, partially offset by lower premiums in the financial institutions business. Average renewal rates for this group were down approximately 1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums are comparable between periods.\nOther specialty The amounts shown as reinsurance premiums ceded represent business assumed by AFG's internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG's other Specialty property and casualty insurance sub-segments.\nCombined Ratio\nPerformance measures such as the combined ratio are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) and underwriting expense ratios.

insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $110 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $10 million (10%). The higher underwriting profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects improved underwriting results in the Property and transportation and Specialty financial sub-segments, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty sub-segment. Overall catastrophe losses were $12 million (1.1 points on the combined ratio) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $9 million (0.8 points on the combined ratio) in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nProperty and transportation Underwriting profit for this group was $75 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $41 million (121%) reflecting higher underwriting profit in the crop insurance business, primarily the result of favorable growing conditions and relatively stable commodity pricing.\nSpecialty casualty Underwriting profit for this group was $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $37 million (74%). This decrease is due primarily to underwriting losses in one of the excess and surplus lines businesses, primarily related to coverage written for New York contractors, and lower profitability in the targeted markets business.\nSpecialty financial Underwriting profit for this group was $20 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $5 million (33%) reflecting higher underwriting profit in the financial institutions, surety and trade credit businesses.\nOther specialty Underwriting profit for this group was $2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $1 million (100%).\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nAFG's overall loss and LAE ratio was 63.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 61.8% for fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 1.9 percentage points.

catastrophe losses\nThe current accident year loss and LAE ratio, excluding catastrophe losses for AFG's Specialty property and casualty insurance operations was 61.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 61.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 0.3%.\nProperty and transportation The 4.8 percentage point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses reflects a decrease in the loss and LAE ratio of the crop business and, to a lesser extent, the equine business and the Singapore branch in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSpecialty casualty The 4.6 percentage point increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses reflects an increase in the loss and LAE ratio of the targeted markets, general liability, excess and surplus and workers' compensation businesses and at Neon.\nSpecialty financial The 2.3 percentage point increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses reflects an increase in the loss and LAE ratio of the financial institutions business.\nNet prior year reserve development\nAFG's Specialty property and casualty insurance operations recorded net adverse reserve development related to prior accident years of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net favorable reserve development related to prior accident years of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nProperty and transportation Net adverse reserve development of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects reserve strengthening at National Interstate and higher than expected claim severity in the ocean marine business. Net adverse reserve development of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects higher than expected claim severity in commercial auto liability insurance at National Interstate and higher than expected claim frequency in the ocean marine business, partially offset by lower than expected claim severity in the property and inland marine business.\nSpecialty casualty Net adverse reserve development of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects higher than anticipated severity in New York contractor claims, adverse reserve development at Neon and higher than anticipated claim severity in the targeted programs business, partially offset by lower than anticipated claim frequency and severity in the workers' compensation businesses. Net favorable reserve development of $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in workers' compensation business, excess liability insurance and directors and officers liability insurance, partially offset by adverse reserve development at Neon.\nSpecialty financial Net favorable reserve development of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects lower than expected claim frequency in the financial institutions business and lower than anticipated claim severity in the fidelity and crime business. Net favorable reserve development of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the fidelity business, lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the surety business and lower than expected claim severity on a run-off block of collateral value insurance, partially offset by higher than expected claim severity in products for financial institutions and in the trade credit business.\nOther specialty In addition to the reserve development discussed above, total Specialty prior year reserve development includes net favorable reserve development of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting amortization of the deferred gain on the retroactive insurance transaction entered into in connection with the sale of businesses in 1998 and 2001 and reserve development associated with AFG's internal reinsurance program.\nCatastrophe losses\nAFG generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and the purchase of reinsurance. Based on data available at December 31, 2016, AFG's exposure to a catastrophic earthquake or windstorm that industry models indicate could occur once in every 500 years (a 500-year event\u201d) is expected to be less than 4% of AFG's Shareholders' Equity. Catastrophe losses of $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 resulted primarily from Hurricane Matthew. The $5 million of catastrophe losses in the Specialty financial group in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted primarily from flooding in the midwestern United States.\nCommissions and Other Underwriting Expenses\nAFG's property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses ( U/W Exp\u201d) were $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $327 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $22 million (7%). AFG's underwriting expense ratio, calculated as commissions and other underwriting expenses divided by net premiums earned, was 26.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 29.2% for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 2.5 percentage points.

In recent years, yields available in the financial markets on fixed maturity securities have generally declined, placing downward pressure on AFG's investment portfolio yield.

The property and casualty insurance segment's overall yield on investments (net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets) was 3.48% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 3.25% for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 0.23 percentage points, reflecting a $5 million increase in income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings and an $8 million increase in equity in the earnings of limited partnerships and similar investments, partially offset by slightly higher investment expenses and lower yields available in the financial markets. The 7% increase in average invested assets in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects a higher average balance in cash and cash equivalents.\nProperty and Casualty Other Income and Expenses, Net\nGAAP other income and expenses, net for AFG's property and casualty operations was a net expense of $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net income of $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $18 million (360%).

These expenses consisted primarily of financial advisory and legal services. See Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements.\nInterest expense for AFG's property and casualty operations includes interest charges on long-term debt within the property and casualty operations.\nAnnuity Segment - Results of Operations\nAFG's annuity operations contributed $132 million in pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $31 million (31%). AFG's annuity segment results for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflect higher investment income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings and an 11% increase in average annuity investments (at amortized cost). In addition, the annuity segment's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 benefitted from the positive impact of a significant increase in interest rates on the fair value accounting for fixed-indexed annuities ( FIAs\u201d). Both periods reflect the positive impact of strong stock market performance on fair value accounting for FIAs. These improved results were partially offset by the impact of lower investment yields due to the run-off of higher yielding investments. AFG's periodic detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations resulted in a net annuity expense reduction of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe following table details AFG's earnings before income taxes from its annuity operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity benefits (*)\n</td> <td>160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetail of annuity earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions):\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes -

Performance measures such as net interest spread and net spread earned are often presented by annuity businesses to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance.\nNet Spread on Fixed Annuities (excludes variable annuity earnings)\nThe table below (dollars in millions) details the components of these spreads for AFG's fixed annuity operations (including fixed-indexed annuities):\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>29,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As % of fixed annuity benefits accumulated (except as noted):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (as % of fixed annuity investments)\n</td> <td>4.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited - fixed\n</td> <td>(2.02\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.12\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest spread\n</td> <td>2.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefit expenses, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>(0.38\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.31\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>(1.06\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.75\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>(0.35\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.32\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking\n</td> <td>0.03\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment's net spread earned on fixed annuities:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities - before impact of derivatives related to FIAs\n</td> <td>1.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related impact on amortization of DPAC (*)\n</td> <td>(0.31\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related impact on amortization of deferred sales inducements (*)\n</td> <td>(0.02\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net spread earned on fixed annuities\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (*) An estimate of the related acceleration/deceleration of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements. \nAnnuity Net Investment Income\nNet investment income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $346 million compared to $309 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $37 million (12%). This increase reflects primarily the growth in AFG's annuity business and higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by the impact of lower investment yields. The overall yield earned on investments in AFG's fixed annuity operations, calculated as net investment income divided by average investment balances (at amortized cost), increased by 0.07 percentage points to 4.72% from 4.65% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase in net investment yield reflects higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by (i) the investment of new premium dollars at lower yields as compared to the existing investment portfolio and (ii) the impact of the reinvestment of proceeds from maturity and redemption of higher yielding investments at the lower yields available in the financial markets. During 2016, $4.0 billion in annuity segment investments with an average yield of 5.51% were redeemed or sold while the investments purchased during 2016 (with new premium dollars and the redemption/sale proceeds) had an average yield at purchase of 4.21%.\nAnnuity Interest Credited - Fixed\nInterest credited - fixed for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $148 million compared to $138 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $10 million (7%). The impact of growth in the annuity business was partially offset by lower interest crediting rates on new premiums as compared to the crediting rates on policyholder funds surrendered or withdrawn. The average interest rate credited to policyholders, calculated as interest credited divided by average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, decreased 0.10 percentage points to 2.02% from 2.12% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nAnnuity Net Interest Spread\nAFG's net interest spread increased 0.17 percentage points to 2.70% from 2.53% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to the impact of lower crediting rates and higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by lower in-force investment yields. Features included in current annuity product offerings allow AFG to achieve its desired profitability at a lower net interest spread than historical product offerings. As a result, AFG expects its net interest spread to narrow in the future.\nAnnuity Policy Charges and Other Miscellaneous Income\nAnnuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income, which consist primarily of surrender charges, amortization of deferred upfront policy charges (unearned revenue) and income from sales of real estate were $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $2 million (18%). The fourth quarter of 2016 includes gains of $2 million from the sale of real estate. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges related to unearned revenue, annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated were 0.15% in both the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income.\nOther Annuity Benefits, Net of Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit Fees\nOther annuity benefits, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees (excluding the impact of unlocking) for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $28 million compared to $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $9 million (47%). As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these net expenses increased 0.07 percentage points to 0.38% from 0.31% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition to interest credited to policyholders' accounts and the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, annuity benefits expense also includes the following expenses (in millions, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees): Table 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in expected death and annuitization reserve\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of sales inducements\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in other benefit reserves\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offset guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other annuity benefits, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed under Annuity Benefits Accumulated\u201d in Note A - Accounting Policies\u201d to the financial statements, guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserves are accrued for and modified using assumptions similar to those used in establishing and amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs. The guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve related to FIAs can be inversely impacted by the calculated FIA embedded derivative reserve as the value to policyholders of the guaranteed withdrawal benefits decreases when the benefit of stock market participation increases.\nAnnuity Acquisition Expenses\nExcluding the impact of unlocking charges (expense reductions) discussed under Annuity Unlocking\u201d below, AFG's amortization of DPAC and commission expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated was 1.06% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 0.75% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and has generally ranged between 0.75% and 0.85%. Variances from the general range relate primarily to the impact of (i) material changes in interest rates or the stock market on AFG's fixed-indexed annuity business, and (ii) differences in actual experience from actuarially projected estimates and assumptions. For example, the positive impact of the significantly higher than anticipated interest rates and strong stock market performance during the fourth quarter of 2016 on the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (discussed below) resulted in a partially offsetting acceleration in the amortization of DPAC. During the third quarter of 2015, the deceleration in the amortization of DPAC caused by the negative impact of poor stock market performance on the fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities was limited on certain recently issued products. This prior period limitation had a $5 million favorable impact on the amortization of DPAC related to the fair value accounting for those derivatives when the stock market rebounded during the fourth quarter of 2015. This favorable impact is reported in the impact on DPAC of derivatives related to FIAs.\nThe table below illustrates the estimated impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on annuity acquisition expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Before the impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the amortization of DPAC\n</td> <td>0.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in fair value of derivatives related to FIAs on the amortization of DPAC (*)\n</td> <td>0.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.06\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity acquisition expenses as a % of fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>1.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (*) An estimate of the acceleration/deceleration in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs resulting from fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities. \nAnnuity Other Expenses\nAnnuity other expenses were $27 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $5 million (23%). Annuity other expenses represent primarily general and administrative expenses, as well as selling and issuance expenses that are not deferred. The increase in annuity other expenses reflects primarily growth in the business and an increase in the number of sales personnel focused on new initiatives and increased market share within existing financial institutions and retail marketing organizations in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. As\na percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these expenses increased 0.03 percentage points to 0.35% from 0.32% for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives Related to Fixed-Indexed Annuities\nAFG's fixed-indexed annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing stock market index. AFG attempts to mitigate the risk in the index-based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index. AFG's strategy is designed so that the change in the fair value of the call option assets will generally offset the economic change in the liabilities from the index participation. Both the index-based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives that must be adjusted for changes in fair value through earnings each period. The fair values of these derivatives are impacted by actual and expected stock market performance and interest rates as well as other factors. For a list of other factors impacting the fair value of the index-based component of AFG's annuity benefits accumulated, see Note D - Fair Value Measurements\u201d to the financial statements. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges, the net change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities decreased annuity benefits by $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and had a nominal impact on annuity benefits in the fourth quarter of 2015. The $54 million decrease in annuity benefits in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects the positive impact of significantly higher than anticipated interest rates and strong market performance on the fair value of these derivatives. As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, this net expense reduction increased 0.71 percentage points to 0.73% in the fourth quarter of 2016 from 0.02% in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFluctuations in interest rates and the stock market, among other factors, can cause volatility in the periodic measurement of fair value of the embedded derivative that management believes can be inconsistent with the long-term economics of these products. The table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions):\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes - before change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related impact on amortization of DPAC (*)\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(600\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (*) An estimate of the related acceleration/deceleration of amortization of deferred sales inducements and deferred policy acquisition costs. \nAs illustrated in the table above, the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, including the related impact on amortization of DPAC, increased the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes by $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and by $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses. Unanticipated spread compression, decreases in the stock market, adverse mortality experience, and higher than expected lapse rates could lead to future write-offs of DPAC or the present value of future profits on business in force of companies acquired ( PVFP\u201d).\nAnnuity Net Spread Earned on Fixed Annuities\nAFG's net spread earned on fixed annuities increased 0.43 percentage points to 1.82% from 1.39% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to the net impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives and related DPAC amortization offset discussed above and the 0.17 percentage points increase in AFG's net interest spread.\nAnnuity Benefits Accumulated\nAnnuity premiums received and benefit payments are recorded as increases or decreases in annuity benefits accumulated rather than as revenue and expense.

There is considerable discussion surrounding the possibility of a delay or other action impacting the rule. On February 9, 2017, the DOL filed a notice with the Office of Management and Budget to delay implementation of the regulation. However, until there is some definitive action impacting the rule, AFG intends to continue to pursue necessary changes.\nAssuming the rule becomes effective in its current form, AFG believes the biggest impact will be on insurance-only licensed agents whose sales represented less than 10% of its fourth quarter annuity premium. While AFG's management continues to believe the adjustments required of AFG and its distribution partners to comply with the rule will impact 2017 annuity premiums, management does not believe the new rule will have a material impact on AFG's results of operations.\nAnnuity Unlocking\nIn the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, AFG conducted a detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations. As a result of these reviews, AFG recorded net expense reductions related to its annuity business of $1 million in 2016 and $10 million in 2015, which impacted AFG's financial statements as follows (in millions):\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy charges and other miscellaneous income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unearned revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity benefits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed-indexed annuity embedded derivative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales inducements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total annuity benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net expense reduction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net expense reduction from unlocking annuity assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects the favorable impact of an increase in projected net interest spreads on in-force business, substantially offset by the unfavorable impact of (i) changes in projected policyholder annuitization and lapse behavior, (ii) an increase in the risk premium for the uncertainty in the cash flows component of the discount rates used to value the FIA-related embedded derivative and (iii) a slight decrease in projected stock market growth over the next three years. Reinvestment rate assumptions are based primarily on 7-year and 10-year corporate bond yields. For the 2016 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 4.24% in 2017, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.55% in 2022 and beyond.\nThe table below compares the reinvestment rate assumed in AFG's fourth quarter unlockings for the next calendar year to the actual reinvestment rate achieved in that period (both net of investment expenses):\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unlocking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reinvestment Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assumed (*)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Achieved\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (*) Assumed reinvestment rates exclude default rates of 0.18% in each period. \nManagement believes that these results demonstrate that AFG's reinvestment rate assumptions are reasonable and prudently conservative. In addition to the reinvestment rates above, actual default rates in 2015 and 2016 were lower than the long-term default rates of 0.18% assumed in the unlocking in each of the periods above.\nThe 2015 net expense reduction was due primarily to the impact of changes in assumptions to reflect higher than previously projected net interest spreads as well as the impact of higher assets under management and expense discipline. For the 2015 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 3.87% in 2016, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.53% in 2022 and beyond.\nAnnuity Earnings before Income Taxes Reconciliation\nThe following table reconciles the net spread earned on AFG's fixed annuities to overall annuity pretax earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings on fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings on investments in excess of fixed annuity benefits accumulated (*)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable annuity earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (*) Net investment income (as a % of investments) of 4.72% and 4.65% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, multiplied by the difference between average fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost) and average fixed annuity benefits accumulated in each period. \nRun-off Long-Term Care and Life Segment - Results of Operations AFG's run-off long-term care and life segment reported GAAP pretax earnings of $2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Results for the 2015 period include a $4 million pretax non-core realized loss adjustment to the previously recognized $162 million estimated pretax loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015.

Net Investment Income\nAFG recorded net investment income on investments held outside of its insurance operations of less than $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nHolding Company and Other - P&C Fees and Related Expenses\nSummit, the workers' compensation insurance business that AFG acquired in April 2014, collects fees from a small group of unaffiliated insurers for providing underwriting, policy administration and claims services. In addition, certain of AFG's property and casualty businesses collect fees from customers for ancillary services such as workplace safety programs and premium financing. In the fourth quarter of 2016, AFG collected $17 million in fees for these services compared to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Management views this fee income, net of the $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, in expenses incurred to generate such fees, as a reduction in the cost of underwriting its property and casualty insurance policies. Consistent with internal management reporting, these fees and the related expenses are netted and recorded as a reduction of commissions and other underwriting expenses in AFG's segmented results.\nHolding Company and Other - Other Income\nOther income in the table above includes $5 million and $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, in management fees paid to AFG by the AFG-managed CLOs (AFG's consolidated managed investment entities). The management fees are eliminated in consolidation - see the other income line in the Consolidate MIEs column under Results of Operations - Segmented Statement of Earnings.\u201d Excluding amounts eliminated in consolidation, AFG recorded other income outside of its insurance operations of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nHolding Company and Other - Interest Charges on Borrowed Money\nAFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $5 million (31%). This increase reflects higher average indebtedness, partially offset by lower average interest rates on outstanding debt.

Approximately $7 million in impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2016 are related to an equity investment in a pharmaceutical company. Approximately $26 million of the charges in the fourth quarter of 2015 are attributable to real estate and mortgage related investments, $12 million are on investments in asset managers and $8 million are on energy related investments.\nConsolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Subsidiaries The $4 million pretax realized loss on subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2015 represents an adjustment to the previously recognized $162 million estimated pretax loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015.\nConsolidated Income Taxes AFG's consolidated provision (credit) for income taxes was a benefit of $71 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to an expense of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $151 million (189%).

Due to the uncertainty concerning the realization of the deferred tax benefits associated with these losses, AFG maintains a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets.\nAs discussed in Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements, AFG acquired the noncontrolling interest in National Interstate Corporation in November 2016. This transaction allowed National Interstate and its subsidiaries to become members of the AFG consolidated tax group, which resulted in a tax benefit of $66 million to AFG during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn connection with the ongoing reorganization of AFG's Neon Lloyd's business, in December 2016, AFG undertook a restructuring that included the liquidation for tax purposes of the foreign subsidiary that is the parent of the Neon Lloyd's operations, resulting in a taxable loss for U.S. tax purposes. AFG reported the $111 million tax benefit associated with this loss in the fourth quarter of 2016. See Note L - Income Taxes\u201d to the financial statements.\nExcluding the tax benefit related to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in NATL and the tax benefit related to the Neon restructuring, AFG's effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was 33%.\nConsolidated Noncontrolling Interests AFG's consolidated net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014\nSegmented Statement of Earnings AFG reports its business as four segments: (i) Property and casualty insurance ( P&C\u201d), (ii) Annuity, (iii) Run-off long-term care and life and (iv) Other, which includes holding company costs and income and expenses related to the managed investment entities ( MIEs\u201d).\nAFG's net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. The following tables for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 identify such items by segment and reconcile net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure that AFG believes is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends (in millions):\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>P&C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annuity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Run-off long-term care and life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consol.

noncontrolling interest impacts of these reconciling items. \nProperty and Casualty Insurance Segment - Results of Operations AFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $577 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2016 compared to $576 million in 2015, an increase of $1 million. Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $646 million in 2016 compared to $577 million in 2015, an increase of $69 million (12%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects improved underwriting results in the Property and transportation group and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty and Specialty financial groups. GAAP pretax earnings also reflect a pretax non-core charge of $65 million in the second quarter of 2016 related to the exit of certain lines of business within Neon and a $32 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a $51 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of a hotel in the second quarter of 2015 and a $15 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as non-core special A&E charges of $36 million in 2016 compared to $67 million in 2015.\nAFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $576 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 compared to $456 million in 2014, an increase of $120 million (26%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $577 million in 2015\ncompared to $480 million in 2014, an increase of $97 million (20%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit across each of AFG's property and casualty insurance sub-segments, higher net investment income (due primarily to the investment of cash acquired in the Summit acquisition on April 1, 2014) and lower net expenses. The increase in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 also reflects pretax non-core gains of $51 million on the sale of a hotel and $15 million on the sale of an apartment property, partially offset by higher non-core special A&E charges in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nThe following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty insurance operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 -

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page.\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial Condition\nAFG is organized as a holding company with almost all of its operations being conducted by subsidiaries. AFG, however, has continuing cash needs for administrative expenses, the payment of principal and interest on borrowings, shareholder dividends, and taxes. Therefore, certain analyses are most meaningfully presented on a parent only basis while others are best done on a total enterprise basis. In addition, because most of its businesses are financial in nature, AFG does not prepare its consolidated financial statements using a current-noncurrent format. Consequently, certain traditional ratios and financial analysis tests are not meaningful.\nAt December 31, 2016, AFG (parent) held approximately $260 million in cash and securities and had $500 million available under a bank line of credit, which expires in June 2021.\nResults of Operations\nThrough the operations of its subsidiaries, AFG is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance, focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses, and in the sale of fixed and fixed-indexed annuities in the retail, financial institutions and education markets.\nFourth quarter 2016 net earnings attributable to AFG's shareholders were $385 million ($4.33 per share, diluted) compared to $129 million ($1.45 per share, diluted) in the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting:\n \u2022 higher underwriting profit and net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment, \n \u2022 higher earnings in the annuity segment, \n \u2022 the fourth quarter 2016 tax benefits from the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring, \n \u2022 the fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property, and \n \u2022 net realized gains on securities in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2015. \nFull year 2016 net earnings attributable to AFG's shareholders were $649 million ($7.33 per share, diluted) compared to $352 million ($3.94 per share, diluted) in 2015, reflecting:\n \u2022 higher underwriting profit and net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment, \n \u2022 higher earnings in the annuity segment, \n \u2022 lower profitability in the run-off long-term care and life segment, \n \u2022 net realized gains on securities in 2016 compared to net realized losses on securities in 2015, \n \u2022 the 2015 loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care business, \n \u2022 the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of an apartment property, which was less than the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of a hotel and the fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property, and \n \u2022 the fourth quarter 2016 tax benefits related to the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSignificant accounting policies are summarized in Note A - Accounting Policies\u201d to the financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements. As more information becomes known, these estimates and assumptions change and, thus, impact amounts reported in the future. The areas where management believes the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements is most significant are as follows:\n \u2022 the establishment of insurance reserves, especially asbestos and environmental-related reserves, \n \u2022 the recoverability of reinsurance, \n \u2022 the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs, \n \u2022 the establishment of asbestos and environmental reserves of former railroad and manufacturing operations, and \n \u2022 the valuation of investments, including the determination of other-than-temporary impairments. \nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Uncertainties\u201d for a discussion of insurance reserves, recoverables from reinsurers, and contingencies related to American Premier's former operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investments\u201d for a discussion of impairments on investments. Deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) and certain liabilities related to annuities are amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies. Assumptions considered in determining expected gross profits involve significant judgment and include management's estimates of interest rates and investment spreads, surrenders, annuitizations, renewal premiums and mortality. Should actual experience require management to change its assumptions (commonly referred to as unlocking\u201d), a charge or credit would be recorded to adjust DPAC or annuity liabilities to the levels they would have been if the new assumptions had been used from the inception date of each policy.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRatios AFG's debt to total capital ratio on a consolidated basis is shown below (dollars in millions). Management intends to maintain the ratio of debt to capital at or below 25% and intends to maintain the capital of its significant insurance subsidiaries at or above levels currently indicated by rating agencies as appropriate for the current ratings. \nThe ratio of debt to total capital is a non-GAAP measure that management believes is useful for investors, analysts and independent ratings agencies to evaluate AFG's financial strength and liquidity and to provide insight into how AFG finances its operations. In addition, maintaining a ratio of debt, excluding subordinated debt and debt secured by real estate, to total capital of 35% or lower is a financial covenant in AFG's bank credit facility. The ratio is calculated by dividing the principal amount of AFG's long-term debt by its total capital, which includes long-term debt, noncontrolling interests and shareholders' equity (excluding unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity investments).\nAFG's ratio of earnings to fixed charges, including annuity benefits as a fixed charge, was 1.85 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding annuity benefits, this ratio was 8.62. Although the ratio excluding annuity benefits is not required or encouraged to be disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, it is presented because interest credited to annuity policyholder accounts is not always considered a borrowing cost for an insurance company.\nThe NAIC's model law for risk based capital ( RBC\u201d) applies to both life and property and casualty companies. RBC formulas determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs so that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired. At December 31, 2016, the capital ratios of all AFG insurance companies substantially exceeded the RBC requirements.\nCondensed Consolidated Cash Flows AFG's principal sources of cash include insurance premiums, income from its investment portfolio and proceeds from the maturities, redemptions and sales of investments. Insurance premiums in excess of acquisition expenses and operating costs are invested until they are needed to meet policyholder obligations or made available to the parent company through dividends to cover debt obligations and corporate expenses, and to provide returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as detailed in AFG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are shown below (in millions):\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities AFG's property and casualty insurance operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as premiums collected and investment income exceed policy acquisition costs, claims payments and operating expenses. AFG's net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by the level and timing of property and casualty premiums, claim and expense payments and recoveries from reinsurers. AFG's annuity operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as investment income exceeds acquisition costs and operating expenses. Interest credited on annuity policyholder funds is a non-cash increase in AFG's annuity benefits accumulated liability and annuity premiums, benefits and withdrawals are considered financing activities due to the deposit-type nature of annuities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.15 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.23 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities AFG's investing activities consist primarily of the investment of funds provided by its property and casualty and annuity products. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.98 billion in 2016 compared to $4.57 billion in 2015, a decrease of $1.59 billion. The $151 million decrease in net cash flows from annuity policyholders in 2016 as compared to 2015 (discussed below under net cash provided by financing activities) decreased the amount of cash available for investment in 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, AFG's cash on hand increased by $887 million during 2016, primarily in the property and casualty and annuity segments reflecting the timing of investing available cash in those segments. Investing activities also include the purchase and disposal of managed investment entity investments (collateralized loan obligations), which are presented separately in AFG's Balance Sheet. Net investment activity in the managed investment entities was a $364 million use of cash in 2016 compared to a $675 million use of cash in 2015, accounting for a $311 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $4.57 billion in 2015 compared to $3.63 billion in 2014, an increase of $945 million. The $537 million increase in net cash flows from annuity policyholders in 2015 as compared to 2014 increased the amount of cash available for investment in 2015 compared to 2014. Net investment activity in the managed investment entities was a $675 million use of cash in 2015 compared to a $275 million use of cash in 2014, accounting for a $400 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities AFG's financing activities consist primarily of transactions with annuity policyholders, issuances and retirements of long-term debt, repurchases of common stock and dividend payments. Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.72 billion in 2016 compared to $3.10 billion in 2015, a decrease of $379 million. Annuity receipts exceeded annuity surrenders, benefits, withdrawals and transfers by $2.35 billion in 2016 compared to $2.50 billion in 2015, resulting in a $151 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. AFG issued $300 million of 3.50% Senior Notes in 2016 and $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures in 2015, the\nnet proceeds of which contributed $296 million in 2016 and $145 million in 2015 to net cash provided by financing activities. Redemptions of long-term debt was an $18 million use of cash in 2016 and a $192 million use of cash in 2015. During 2016, AFG repurchased $133 million of its Common Stock compared to $126 million repurchased in 2015, which accounted for a $7 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2016, $315 million was used to fund the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in National Interstate Corporation. Financing activities also include issuances and retirements of managed investment entity liabilities, which are nonrecourse to AFG and presented separately in AFG's Balance Sheet. Issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $693 million in 2016 compared to $890 million in 2015, accounting for a $197 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015. See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3.10 billion in 2015 compared to $2.10 billion in 2014, an increase of $996 million. Annuity receipts exceeded annuity surrenders, benefits, withdrawals and transfers by $2.50 billion in 2015 compared to $1.97 billion in 2014, resulting in a $537 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities. Redemptions of long-term debt resulted in a $192 million use of cash in 2015. AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures in 2015 and $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures in 2014, the net proceeds of each issuance contributed $145 million to net cash provided by financing activities in those years. During 2015, AFG repurchased $126 million of its Common Stock compared to $191 million in 2014, which accounted for a $65 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014. Issuances of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded retirements by $890 million in 2015 compared to $306 million in 2014, accounting for a $584 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014.\nParent and Subsidiary Liquidity\nParent Holding Company Liquidity Management believes AFG has sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements. If funds generated from operations, including dividends, tax payments and borrowings from subsidiaries, are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period, AFG would be required to utilize parent company cash and marketable securities or to generate cash through borrowings, sales of other assets, or similar transactions.\nIn June 2016, AFG replaced its bank credit facility with a five-year, $500 million revolving credit line. Amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at rates ranging from 1.00% to 1.875% (currently 1.375%) over LIBOR based on AFG's credit rating. There were no borrowings under this agreement, or under any other parent company short-term borrowing arrangements, during 2016.\nOn November 10, 2016, AFG acquired the 49% of National Interstate Corporation ( NATL\u201d) not previously owned by AFG's wholly-owned subsidiary, Great American Insurance Company ( GAI\u201d) for $315 million ($32.00 per share) in cash in a merger transaction. In addition, NATL paid a one-time special cash dividend of $0.50 per share to its shareholders immediately prior to the merger closing ($5 million was paid to noncontrolling shareholders). See Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements.\nIn August 2016, AFG issued $300 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due 2026. AFG used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the acquisition of NATL mentioned above.\nDuring 2016, AFG repurchased 1.9 million shares of its Common Stock for $133 million. In December 2016, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $87 million.\nIn November 2015, AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures due 2055. In September 2015, AFG redeemed its $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050 at par using cash on hand at the parent company.\nDuring 2015, AFG repurchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock for $126 million. In December 2015, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million.\nIn April 2014, AFG completed the purchase of Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and its related companies ( Summit\u201d) from Liberty Mutual Insurance for $259 million using cash on hand at the parent company. In addition, AFG made a capital contribution of approximately $140 million, bringing its capital investment in the Summit business to $399 million. Summit's results of operations are included in AFG's consolidated results beginning in April of 2014.\nIn September 2014, AFG issued $150 million of 6-1/4% Subordinated Debentures due 2054. During 2014, AFG repurchased 3.3 million shares of its Common Stock for $191 million. In December 2014, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million.\nAll debentures and notes issued by AFG are rated investment grade by two nationally recognized rating agencies. Under a currently effective shelf registration statement, AFG can offer additional equity or debt securities. The shelf registration provides AFG with flexibility to access the capital markets from time to time as market and other conditions permit.\nUnder a tax allocation agreement with AFG, its 80%-owned U.S. subsidiaries generally pay taxes to (or recover taxes from) AFG based on each subsidiary's contribution to amounts due under AFG's consolidated tax return.\nSubsidiary Liquidity Great American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC\u201d), a wholly-owned annuity subsidiary, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati ( FHLB\u201d). The FHLB makes advances and provides other banking services to member institutions, which provides the annuity operations with an additional source of liquidity. These advances further the FHLB's mission of improving access to housing by increasing liquidity in the residential mortgage-backed securities market. At December 31, 2016, GALIC had $935 million in outstanding advances from the FHLB (included in annuity benefits accumulated), bearing interest at rates ranging from 0.03% to 0.53% over LIBOR (average rate of 1.18% at December 31, 2016). In the fourth quarter of 2016, GALIC extended the terms on advances totaling $200 million by four years. While these advances must be repaid between 2018 and 2021 ($285 million in 2018, $500 million in 2020 and $150 million in 2021), GALIC has the option to prepay all or a portion of the advances. GALIC has invested the proceeds from the advances in fixed maturity securities with similar expected lives as the advances for the purpose of earning a spread over the interest payments due to the FHLB. At December 31, 2016, GALIC estimated that it had additional borrowing capacity of approximately $300 million from the FHLB.\nThe liquidity requirements of AFG's insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and expenses, payments of dividends and taxes to AFG and contributions of capital to their subsidiaries. Historically, cash flows from premiums and investment income have generally provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements. Funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities. In addition, the insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid, short-term investments.\nThe excess cash flow of AFG's property and casualty group allows it to extend the duration of its investment portfolio somewhat beyond that of its claim reserves.\nIn the annuity business, where profitability is largely dependent on earning a spread between invested assets and annuity liabilities, the duration of investments is generally maintained close to that of liabilities. In a rising interest rate environment, significant protection from withdrawals exists in the form of temporary and permanent surrender charges on AFG's annuity products. With declining rates, AFG receives some protection (from spread compression) due to the ability to lower crediting rates, subject to contractually guaranteed minimum interest rates ( GMIRs\u201d). AFG began selling policies with GMIRs below 2% in 2003; almost all new business since late 2010 has been issued with a 1% GMIR. At December 31, 2016, AFG could reduce the average crediting rate on approximately $22 billion of traditional fixed and fixed-indexed annuities without guaranteed withdrawal benefits by approximately 80 basis points (on a weighted average basis). Annuity policies are subject to GMIRs at policy issuance. The table below shows the breakdown of annuity reserves by GMIR. The current interest crediting rates on substantially all of AFG's annuities with a GMIR of 3% or higher are at their minimum.\n\nAFG's weighted average cost of funds for newly issued traditional fixed and fixed-indexed annuities was 2.28% for 2016 compared to 2.31% for 2015. In the first half of 2016, AFG lowered the crediting rates on new annuity sales due to the decline in market investment yields experienced during that period. Conversely, AFG raised crediting rates on new annuity sales in the\nlatter part of 2016 in response to rising market investment yields. In addition to lowering the cost of funds, AFG reduced certain commission rates and guaranteed withdrawal benefits on annuities sold in 2016.\nFor statutory accounting purposes, equity securities of non-affiliates and equity call options used in the fixed-indexed annuity business are generally carried at fair value. At December 31, 2016, AFG's insurance companies owned publicly traded equity securities with a fair value of $1.51 billion and equity call options with a fair value of $492 million. Decreases in market prices could adversely affect the insurance group's capital, potentially impacting the amount of dividends available or necessitating a capital contribution. Conversely, increases in market prices could have a favorable impact on the group's dividend-paying capability.\nAFG believes its insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and benefits and operating expenses. In addition, these subsidiaries have sufficient capital to meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies, inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies. Nonetheless, changes in statutory accounting rules, significant declines in the fair value of the insurance subsidiaries' investment portfolios or significant ratings downgrades on these investments, could create a need for additional capital.\nCondensed Parent Only Cash Flows AFG's parent holding company only condensed cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are shown below (in millions):\n\nParent Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Parent holding company cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of dividends and tax payments received from AFG's insurance subsidiaries, reduced by tax payments to the IRS and holding company interest and other expenses. Parent holding company net cash provided by operating activities was $555 million in 2016 compared to $162 million in 2015 and $372 million in 2014. Higher dividends received from subsidiaries in 2016 as compared to 2015 were the primary driver of the $393 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities. The $210 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily the result of lower dividends received.\nParent Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Parent holding company investing activities consist of capital contributions to and returns of capital from subsidiaries and, to a much lesser extent, parent company investment activity. Parent holding company net cash used in investing activities was $560 million in 2016 compared to $33 million in 2015 and $432 million in 2014. The $560 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 as compared to the $33 million in 2015 is significantly higher due primarily to increased capital contributions to a subsidiary to fund the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in National Interstate Corporation. The $33 million of parent holding company net cash used in investing activities in 2015 was significantly lower than the $432 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 due primarily to capital contributions made to a subsidiary to fund the $399 million investment in Summit in 2014.\nParent Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Parent company financing activities consist primarily of repurchases of AFG Common Stock, dividends to shareholders, the issuance and retirement of long-term debt and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Significant long-term debt and common stock transactions are discussed above under Parent Holding Company Liquidity.\u201d Parent holding company net cash provided by financing activities was $13 million in 2016 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $232 million in 2015 and $171 million in 2014. The $245 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflects proceeds from additional long-term borrowings. The $61 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 reflects the 2015 redemption of $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050, partially offset by a $65 million decrease in common stock repurchases.\nContractual Obligations The following table shows an estimate (based on historical patterns and expected trends) of payments to be made for insurance reserve liabilities, as well as scheduled payments for major contractual obligations (in millions). \n (a) Amounts presented in the table represent estimated cash payments under such contracts, based on significant assumptions related to mortality, morbidity, lapse, renewal, retirement and annuitization. These assumptions also include interest and index crediting consistent with assumptions used to amortize DPAC and assess loss recognition. All estimated cash payments are undiscounted for the time value of money. As a result, total outflows for all years exceed the corresponding liabilities of $29.91 billion for annuity benefits accumulated and $691 million for life, accident and health reserves included in AFG's Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. Based on the same assumptions, AFG projects reinsurance recoveries related to life, accident and health reserves totaling $769 million as follows: Within 1 year - $81 million; 2-3 years - $129 million; 4-5 years - $110 million; and thereafter - $449 million. Actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates. \n (b) Dollar amounts and time periods are estimates based on historical net payment patterns applied to the gross reserves and do not represent actual contractual obligations. Based on the same assumptions, AFG projects reinsurance recoveries related to these reserves totaling $2.30 billion as follows: Within 1 year - $600 million; 2-3 years - $600 million; 4-5 years - $300 million; and thereafter - $800 million. Actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates. \nAFG has no material contractual purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements See Note P - Additional Information - Financial Instruments - Unfunded Commitments\u201d to the financial statements.\nInvestments AFG attempts to optimize investment income while building the value of its portfolio, placing emphasis upon total long-term performance.\nAFG's investment portfolio at December 31, 2016, contained $34.54 billion in fixed maturity securities and $1.50 billion in equity securities classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in a separate component of shareholders' equity on an after-tax basis. In addition, $359 million in fixed maturities and $56 million in equity securities were classified as trading with changes in unrealized holding gains or losses included in net investment income.\nAs detailed in Note E - Investments - Net Unrealized Gain on Marketable Securities\u201d to the financial statements, unrealized gains and losses on AFG's fixed maturity and equity securities are included in shareholders' equity after adjustments for related changes in DPAC and certain liabilities related to annuity, long-term care and life businesses, noncontrolling interests and deferred income taxes. DPAC and certain other balance sheet amounts applicable to annuity, long-term care and life businesses are adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses had been realized, with corresponding increases or decreases (net of tax) included in accumulated other comprehensive income in AFG's Balance Sheet.\nFixed income investment funds are generally invested in securities with intermediate-term maturities with an objective of optimizing total return while allowing flexibility to react to changes in market conditions. At December 31, 2016, the average life of AFG's fixed maturities was about 6-1/2 years.\nFair values for AFG's portfolio are determined by AFG's internal investment professionals using data from nationally recognized pricing services as well as non-binding broker quotes. Fair values of equity securities are generally based on published closing prices. For mortgage-backed securities ( MBS\u201d), which comprise approximately 15% of AFG's fixed maturities, prices for each security are generally obtained from both pricing services and broker quotes. For the remainder of AFG's fixed maturity portfolio, approximately 79% are priced using pricing services and the balance is priced primarily by\nusing non-binding broker quotes. When prices obtained for the same security vary, AFG's internal investment professionals select the price they believe is most indicative of an exit price.\nThe pricing services use a variety of observable inputs to estimate fair value of fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis. Based upon information provided by the pricing services, these inputs include, but are not limited to, recent reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids or offers, reference data, and measures of volatility. Included in the pricing of MBS are estimates of the rate of future prepayments and defaults of principal over the remaining life of the underlying collateral. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on brokers' prices are classified as Level 3 in the GAAP hierarchy unless the price can be corroborated, for example, by comparison to similar securities priced using observable inputs.\nValuation techniques utilized by pricing services and prices obtained from external sources are reviewed by AFG's internal investment professionals who are familiar with the securities being priced and the markets in which they trade to ensure the fair value determination is representative of an exit price. To validate the appropriateness of the prices obtained, these investment managers consider widely published indices (as benchmarks), recent trades, changes in interest rates, general economic conditions and the credit quality of the specific issuers. In addition, AFG communicates directly with pricing services regarding the methods and assumptions used in pricing, including verifying, on a test basis, the inputs used by the services to value specific securities.\nIn general, the fair value of AFG's fixed maturity investments is inversely correlated to changes in interest rates. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of such fair values to reasonably likely changes in interest rates by illustrating the estimated effect on AFG's fixed maturity portfolio and accumulated other comprehensive income that an immediate increase of 100 basis points in the interest rate yield curve would have at December 31, 2016 (dollars in millions). Effects of increases or decreases from the 100 basis points illustrated would be approximately proportional.\n\nApproximately 89% of the fixed maturities held by AFG at December 31, 2016, were rated investment grade\u201d (credit rating of AAA to BBB) by nationally recognized rating agencies. Investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated and non-investment grade. Management believes that the high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return.\nMBS are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that, in periods of declining interest rates, mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates. Although interest rates have been low in recent years, tighter lending standards have resulted in fewer buyers being able to refinance the mortgages underlying much of AFG's non-agency residential MBS portfolio.\nSummarized information for AFG's MBS (including those classified as trading) at December 31, 2016, is shown in the table below (dollars in millions). Agency-backed securities are those issued by a U.S. government-backed agency; Alt-A mortgages are those with risk profiles between prime and subprime. The average life of the residential and commercial MBS is approximately 4-1/2 years and 4 years, respectively.\n\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC\u201d) assigns creditworthiness designations on a scale of 1 to 6 with 1 being the highest quality and 6 being the lowest quality. The NAIC retains third-party investment management firms to assist in the determination of appropriate NAIC designations for mortgage-backed securities based not only on the probability of loss (which is the primary basis of ratings by the major ratings firms), but also on the severity of loss and statutory carrying value. At December 31, 2016, 97% (based on statutory carrying value of $4.75 billion) of AFG's MBS had an NAIC designation of 1.\nMunicipal bonds represented approximately 19% of AFG's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2016. AFG's municipal bond portfolio is high quality, with 98% of the securities rated investment grade at that date. The portfolio is well diversified across the states of issuance and individual issuers. At December 31, 2016, approximately 76% of the municipal bond portfolio was held in revenue bonds, with the remaining 24% held in general obligation bonds. General obligation securities of California, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Puerto Rico collectively represented approximately 1% of this portfolio.\nSummarized information for the unrealized gains and losses recorded in AFG's Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016, is shown in the following table (dollars in millions). Approximately $288 million of available for sale fixed maturity securities and $41 million of available for sale equity securities had no unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2016.\n\nThe table below sets forth the scheduled maturities of AFG's available for sale fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2016, based on their fair values. Securities with sinking funds are reported at average maturity. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid by the issuers.\n\nThe table below (dollars in millions) summarizes the unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities by dollar amount:\n\nThe following table (dollars in millions) summarizes the unrealized losses for all securities with unrealized losses by issuer quality and the length of time those securities have been in an unrealized loss position:\n\nWhen a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, a provision for impairment is charged to earnings (accounted for as a realized loss) and the cost basis of that investment is reduced by the amount of the charge. The determination of whether unrealized losses are other-than-temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors. Factors considered and resources used by management include:\n a) whether the unrealized loss is credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates, \n b) the extent to which fair value is less than cost basis, \n c) cash flow projections received from independent sources, \n d) historical operating, balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer SEC filings and news releases, \n e) near-term prospects for improvement in the issuer and/or its industry, \n f) third party research and communications with industry specialists, \n g) financial models and forecasts, \n h) the continuity of dividend payments, maintenance of investment grade ratings and hybrid nature of certain investments, \n i) discussions with issuer management, and \n j) ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value. \nBased on its analysis of the factors listed above, management believes AFG will recover its cost basis in the securities with unrealized losses and that AFG has the ability to hold the securities until they recover in value and had no intent to sell them at December 31, 2016. Although AFG has the ability to continue holding its investments with unrealized losses, its intent to hold them may change due to deterioration in the issuers' creditworthiness, decisions to lessen exposure to a particular issuer or industry, asset/liability management decisions, market movements, changes in views about appropriate asset allocation or the desire to offset taxable realized gains. Should AFG's ability or intent change with regard to a particular security, a charge for impairment would likely be required. While it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired, charges for other-than-temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in future periods. Significant declines in the fair value of AFG's investment portfolio could have a significant adverse effect on AFG's liquidity. For information on AFG's realized gains (losses) on securities, including charges for other-than-temporary impairment, see Results of Operations - Consolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities.\u201d\nUncertainties As more fully explained in the following paragraphs, management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and contingencies arising out of its former railroad and manufacturing operations.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves Estimating the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors that are subject to significant variation. Determining the liability is a complex process incorporating input from many areas of the Company including actuarial, underwriting, pricing, claims and operations management.\nThe estimates of liabilities for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based upon: (i) the accumulation of case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting periods on direct business written ( case reserves\u201d); (ii) estimates received from ceding reinsurers and insurance pools and associations; (iii) estimates of claims incurred but not reported or IBNR\u201d (including possible development on known claims); (iv) estimates (based on experience) of expense for investigating and adjusting claims; and (v) the current state of law and coverage litigation.\nThe process used to determine the total reserve for liabilities involves estimating the ultimate incurred losses and LAE, adjusted for amounts already paid on the claims. The IBNR reserve is derived by first estimating the ultimate unpaid reserve liability and subtracting case reserves for loss and LAE. See Note O - Insurance - Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves\u201d to the financial statements for a discussion of the factors considered and actuarial methods used in determining management's best estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and LAE.\nThe following table shows (in millions) the breakdown of AFG's property and casualty reserves between case reserves, IBNR reserves and LAE reserves (estimated amounts required to adjust, record and settle claims, other than the claim payments themselves).\n\nWhile current factors and reasonably likely changes in variable factors are considered in estimating the liability for unpaid losses, there is no method or system that can eliminate the risk of actual ultimate results differing from such estimates.\nFollowing is a discussion of certain critical variables affecting the estimation of loss reserves of the more significant long-tail lines of business (asbestos and environmental liabilities are separately discussed below). Many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs.\nAn important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future. However, future results could vary due to an unexpected change in the underlying cost trends. This unexpected change could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation, inflation from social programs, new medical technologies, or other factors such as those listed below in connection with AFG's largest lines of business. It is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these variables, and future cost trends could be partially impacted by several such variables. However, it is reasonable to address the sensitivity of the reserves to potential impact from changes in these variables by measuring the effect of a possible overall 1% change in future cost trends that may be caused by one or more variables. Utilizing the effect of a 1% change in overall cost trends enables changes greater than 1% to be estimated by extrapolation. Each additional 1% change in the cost trend would increase the effect on net earnings by an amount slightly (about 5%) greater than the effect of the previous 1%. For example, if a 1% change in cost trends in a line of business would change net earnings by $20 million, a 2% change would change net earnings by approximately $41 million.\nThe estimated cumulative impact that a 1% change in cost trends in AFG's more significant lines of property and casualty business (exceeding 5% of total reserves) would have on net earnings is shown below (in millions). \nThe judgments and uncertainties surrounding management's reserve estimation process and the potential for reasonably possible variability in management's most recent reserve estimates may also be viewed by looking at how recent historical estimates of reserves have developed. The following table shows (dollars in millions) what the impact on AFG's net earnings would be on the more significant lines of business if the December 31, 2016, reserves (net of reinsurance) developed at the same rate as the average development of the most recent five years.\n\n (a) Adverse (favorable), net of tax effect. \n (b) Excludes asbestos and environmental liabilities. \nThe following discussion describes key assumptions and important variables that affect the estimate of the reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses of the more significant lines of business and explains what caused them to change from assumptions used in the preceding period.\nWorkers' Compensation\nThis long-tail line of business provides coverage to employees who may be injured in the course of employment. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for workers' compensation include:\n \u2022 Legislative actions and regulatory and legal interpretations \n \u2022 Future medical cost inflation \n \u2022 Economic conditions \n \u2022 Timing of claims reporting \n \u2022 Medical advances and changes to life expectancies \nIn April 2014, AFG acquired Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and related companies, a leading provider of workers' compensation solutions in the southeastern United States. The Summit acquisition significantly increased AFG's volume of workers' compensation business and improved its geographic diversity. Approximately 24% and 18% of AFG's workers' compensation reserves at December 31, 2016 relate to policies written in Florida and California, respectively. Over the past 13 years in both states, there have been numerous revisions to workers' compensation regulations and operating environments, adding difficulty and uncertainty to the estimation of related liabilities.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $85 million in 2016 due to lower than anticipated claim severity and improving claim closure rates. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $45 million in 2015 due to lower than anticipated claim severity across all regions of the country. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in 2014, as favorable reserve development in the business written in California was partially offset by adverse reserve development in other states.\nOther Liability - Occurrence\nThis long-tail line of business consists of coverages protecting the insured against legal liability resulting from negligence, carelessness, or a failure to act causing property damage or personal injury to others. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability - occurrence include:\n \u2022 Litigious climate \n \u2022 Unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues \n \u2022 Magnitude of jury awards \n \u2022 Outside counsel costs \n \u2022 Timing of claims reporting \nAFG recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $61 million in 2016 related to its other liability - occurrence coverage due primarily to increased severity in New York contractor claims. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in 2015 and $15 million in 2014 as both the frequency and severity of claims in excess and umbrella liability coverages were lower than previously projected.\nWhile management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above, more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held. For recent accident years, more weight is given to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.\nCommercial Auto/Truck Liability/Medical\nThis line of business is a mix of coverage protecting the insured against legal liability for property damage or personal injury to others arising from the operation of commercial motor vehicles. The property damage liability exposure is usually short-tail with relatively quick reporting and settlement of claims. The bodily injury and medical payments exposures are longer-tailed; although the claim reporting is relatively quick, the final settlement can take longer to achieve. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto/truck liability/medical are similar to other liability - occurrence and include:\n \u2022 Magnitude of jury awards \n \u2022 Unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues \n \u2022 Litigious climate and trends \n \u2022 Change in frequency of severe accidents \n \u2022 Health care costs and utilization of medical services by injured parties \nAFG recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $28 million in 2016, $20 million in 2015 and $28 million in 2014 for this line of business as claim severity has been significantly higher than expected in accident years 2010 and subsequent.\nOther Liability - Claims Made\nThis long-tail line of business consists mostly of directors' and officers' liability ( D&O\u201d). Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability - claims made include:\n \u2022 Litigious climate \n \u2022 Economic conditions \n \u2022 Variability of stock prices \n \u2022 Magnitude of jury awards \nThe general state of the economy and the variability of the stock price of the insured can affect the frequency and severity of shareholder class action suits and other situations that trigger coverage under D&O policies. For example, from 2008 to 2010, economic conditions led to higher frequency of claims, particularly in the D&O policies for small account and not-for-profit organizations. Since then, claim frequency has continually decreased from its peak in 2010, offsetting increased claim severity.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $24 million in 2016, $12 million in 2015 and $18 million in 2014 on its D&O business as claim severity was less than expected across several prior accident years.\nReserves of Foreign Operations\nReserves of foreign operations relate primarily to the operations of Neon Underwriting Limited ( Neon\u201d), AFG's wholly-owned United Kingdom-based Lloyd's insurer. Historically, the largest line of business written by Neon was non-U.S. medical malpractice, which provides coverage for injuries and damages caused by medical care providers, including but not limited to, hospitals and their physicians. Although Neon offered this product in approximately 30 countries, the majority of the business has been written in the United Kingdom, Australia and Italy. In addition, Neon writes marine, equine, professional indemnity, directors and officers liability, catastrophe and cyber insurance and previously offered general liability policies. Significant variables in estimating the loss reserves include:\n \u2022 Litigious environment \n \u2022 Magnitude of court awards \n \u2022 A slow moving judicial system including varying approaches to medical malpractice claims among courts \n \u2022 Trends in claim costs, including medical cost inflation \nDuring the second quarter of 2016, Neon completed a strategic review of its business under a new leadership team. As part of its strategic review, Neon sold and/or exited certain historical lines of business including its medical malpractice and general liability classes. As a result of Neon's claims review of its exited lines of business, AFG recorded a charge of approximately $65 million, including $57 million to increase loss reserves (adverse development) primarily related to its medical malpractice and general liability lines. In addition to the exited lines charge, Neon recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $21 million in 2016, $44 million in 2015 and $14 million in 2014. The adverse development in 2016 outside of the exited lines charge was attributable to reserve strengthening in several lines of business, including political risk and personal accident. The adverse development in 2015 and 2014 was attributable to reserve strengthening in several lines of business, primarily Dutch hospital medical malpractice, Australian and other general liability and personal accident insurance.\nRecoverables from Reinsurers and Availability of Reinsurance AFG is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers, as reinsurance contracts do not relieve AFG of its liability to policyholders. To mitigate this risk, substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade S&P ratings or is secured by funds withheld\u201d or other collateral.\nThe availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, which are beyond AFG's control and which may affect AFG's level of business and profitability. Although the cost of certain reinsurance programs may increase, management believes that AFG will be able to maintain adequate reinsurance coverage at acceptable rates without a material adverse effect on AFG's results of operations. AFG's gross and net combined ratios are shown in the table below.\nSee Item 1 - Business - Property and Casualty Insurance Segment - Reinsurance\u201d for more information on AFG's reinsurance programs. For additional information on the effect of reinsurance on AFG's historical results of operations see Note O - Insurance - Reinsurance\u201d to the financial statements.\nThe following table illustrates the effect that purchasing property and casualty reinsurance has had on AFG's combined ratio over the last three years.\n\nOutside of its property and casualty operations, AFG also has reinsurance recoverables totaling $343 million, including $296 million related to the run-off life business. These recoverables include $254 million directly or indirectly from Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America (rated A+ by A.M. Best).\nAsbestos and Environmental-related ( A&E\u201d) Insurance Reserves Asbestos and environmental reserves of the property and casualty group consisted of the following (in millions):\n\nAsbestos reserves include claims asserting alleged injuries and damages from exposure to asbestos. Environmental reserves include claims relating to polluted sites.\nAsbestos claims against manufacturers, distributors or installers of asbestos products were presented under the products liability section of their policies, which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer's liability. In recent years, a number of asbestos claims are being presented as non-products\u201d claims, such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property, under the premises or operations section of their policies. Unlike products exposures, these non-products exposures typically had no aggregate limits, creating potentially greater exposure for insurers. Further, in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage, some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non-products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non-products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits. AFG, along with other insurers, is and will be subject to such non-products claims. It is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non-products coverage or whether AFG and other insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses. Therefore, the future impact of such efforts is uncertain.\nApproximately 41% of AFG's net asbestos reserves relate to policies written directly by AFG subsidiaries. Claims from these policies generally are product-oriented claims with only a limited amount of non-products exposures, and are dominated by small to mid-sized commercial entities that are mostly regional policyholders with few national target defendants. The remainder is assumed reinsurance business that includes exposures for the periods 1954 to 1983. The asbestos and environmental assumed claims are ceded by various insurance companies under reinsurance treaties. A majority of the individual assumed claims have exposures of less than $100,000 to AFG. Asbestos losses assumed include some of the industry known manufacturers, distributors and installers. Pollution losses include industry known insured names and sites.\nEstablishing reserves for A&E claims relating to policies and participations in reinsurance treaties and former operations is subject to uncertainties that are significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims. For this group of claims, traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical loss development trends cannot be used and a range of reasonably possible losses cannot be estimated. Case reserves and expense reserves are established by the claims department as specific policies are identified. In addition to the case reserves established for known claims, management establishes additional reserves for claims not yet known or reported and for possible development on known claims. These additional reserves are management's best estimate based on periodic comprehensive studies and internal reviews adjusted for payments and identifiable changes, supplemented by management's review of industry information about such claims, with due consideration to individual claim situations.\nManagement believes that estimating the ultimate liability for asbestos claims presents a unique and difficult challenge to the insurance industry due to, among other things, inconsistent court decisions, an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos-related liabilities, novel theories of coverage, and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage. The casualty insurance industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues as the volume and severity of claims against asbestos defendants continue to increase. Environmental claims likewise present challenges in prediction, due to uncertainty regarding the interpretation of insurance policies, complexities regarding multi-party involvements at sites, evolving cleanup standards and protracted time periods required to assess the level of cleanup required at contaminated sites.\nThe following factors could impact AFG's reserves and payments:\n \u2022 There is a growing interest at the state level to attempt to legislatively address asbestos liabilities and the manner in which asbestos claims are resolved. These developments are fluid and could result in piecemeal state-by-state solutions. \n \u2022 The manner by which bankruptcy courts are addressing asbestos liabilities is in flux. \n \u2022 AFG's insureds may make claims alleging significant non-products exposures. \nWhile management believes that AFG's reserves for A&E claims are a reasonable estimate of ultimate liability for such claims, actual results may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded due to the difficulty in predicting the number of future claims, the impact of recent bankruptcy filings, and unresolved issues such as whether coverage exists, whether policies are subject to aggregate limits on coverage, how claims are to be allocated among triggered policies and implicated years, and whether claimants who exhibit no signs of illness will be successful in pursuing their claims. A 1% variation in loss cost trends, caused by any of the factors previously described, would change net income by approximately $20 million.\nAFG tracks its A&E claims by policyholder. The following table shows, by type of claim, the number of policyholders that did not receive any payments in the calendar year separate from policyholders that did receive a payment. Policyholder counts represent policies written by AFG subsidiaries and do not include assumed reinsurance.\n\nAmounts paid (net of reinsurance recoveries) for asbestos and environmental claims, including loss adjustment expenses, were as follows (in millions):\n\nThe survival ratio is a measure often used by industry analysts to compare A&E reserves strength among companies. This ratio is typically calculated by dividing reserves for A&E exposures by the three-year average of paid losses, and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to pay off current reserves based on recent average payments. Because this ratio can be significantly impacted by a number of factors such as loss payout variability, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy based simply on the survival ratio. At December 31, 2016, the property and casualty insurance segment's three-year survival ratios compare favorably with industry survival ratios published by A.M. Best (as of December 31, 2015) as detailed in the following table: \nAFG has periodically conducted comprehensive external studies of its asbestos and environmental exposures relating to the run-off operations of its property and casualty insurance segment and exposures related to its former railroad and manufacturing operations with the aid of specialty actuarial, engineering and consulting firms and outside counsel, generally every two years, with an in-depth internal review during the intervening years.\nAn in-depth internal review of AFG's A&E reserves was completed in the third quarter of 2016 by AFG's internal A&E claims specialists and actuaries in consultation with specialty outside counsel and an outside consultant. As a result of the review, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $36 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by\n$5 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $31 million (net of reinsurance). Over the past few years, the focus of AFG's asbestos claims litigation has shifted to smaller companies and companies with ancillary exposures. AFG's insureds with these exposures have been the driver of the property and casualty insurance segment's asbestos reserve increases in recent years. AFG is seeing modestly increasing estimates for indemnity and defense compared to prior studies. Overall, the rate of new asbestos cases received is down modestly. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was primarily associated with updated estimates of site investigation costs with respect to existing sites and newly identified sites. AFG is seeing increased legal defense costs in environmental claims generally, as well as a number of claims and sites where the estimated investigation and remediation costs have increased. As in past years, there were no new or emerging broad industry trends that were identified in the review.\nAs a result of the comprehensive external study completed in the third quarter of 2015, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $67 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $25 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $42 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in property and casualty asbestos reserves was attributed to increased estimates for indemnity and defense costs. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nAs a result of the in-depth internal review completed in the third quarter of 2014, AFG's property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $24 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $4 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $20 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to AFG's increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nContingencies related to Subsidiaries' Former Operations The A&E studies and reviews discussed above encompassed reserves for various environmental and occupational injury and disease claims and other contingencies arising out of the railroad operations disposed of by American Premier's predecessor and certain manufacturing operations disposed of by American Premier and its subsidiaries and by Great American Financial Resources, Inc. Charges resulting from the A&E study and reviews were $5 million in 2016, $12 million in 2015 and $6 million in 2014. For a discussion of the charges recorded for those operations, see Holding Company, Other and Unallocated - Results of Operations.\u201d Liabilities for claims and contingencies arising from these former railroad and manufacturing operations totaled $86 million at December 31, 2016. For a discussion of the uncertainties in determining the ultimate liability, see Note M - Contingencies\u201d to the financial statements.\nRun-off Long-term Care Insurance In December 2015, AFG completed the sale of United Teacher Associates Insurance Company and Continental General Insurance Company, the legal entities containing substantially all of its run-off long-term care insurance business, to HC2 Holdings, Inc. ( HC2\u201d) for approximately $13 million in net proceeds. AFG may also receive up to $13 million of additional proceeds from HC2 in the future contingent upon the release of certain statutory-basis liabilities of the legal entities sold by AFG. In connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction, AFG agreed to provide up to an aggregate of $35 million of capital support for the insurance companies, on an as-needed basis to maintain specified surplus levels, subject to immediate reimbursement by HC2 through a five-year capital maintenance agreement. With the completion of this sale, AFG divested substantially all of its long-term care business (96% as measured by net statutory reserves as of November 30, 2015) and retained only a small block of long-term care insurance (1,600 policies) with approximately $37 million of reserves at December 31, 2016. AFG will continue to service and accept renewal premiums on its remaining outstanding policies, which are guaranteed renewable.\nMANAGED INVESTMENT ENTITIES\nAccounting standards require AFG to consolidate its investments in collateralized loan obligation ( CLO\u201d) entities that it manages and owns an interest in (in the form of debt). See Note A - Accounting Policies - Managed Investment Entities\u201d and Note H - Managed Investment Entities\u201d to the financial statements. The effect of consolidating these entities is shown in the tables below (in millions). The Before CLO Consolidation\u201d columns include AFG's investment and earnings in the CLOs on an unconsolidated basis.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATING BALANCE SHEET\n\n (a) Elimination of the fair value of AFG's investment in CLOs and related accrued interest. \nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATING STATEMENT OF EARNINGS\n\n (a) Includes a gain of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a loss of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, representing the change in fair value of AFG's CLO investments plus $5 million and $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, in CLO management fees earned. \n (b) Elimination of the change in fair value of AFG's investments in the CLOs, including $8 million and $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, in distributions recorded as interest expense by the CLOs. \n (c) Elimination of management fees earned by AFG. \nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATING STATEMENT OF EARNINGS - CONTINUED\n\n (a) Includes a gain of $37 million in 2016 and a loss of $6 million in 2015, representing the change in fair value of AFG's CLO investments plus $17 million and $15 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in CLO management fees earned. \n (b) Elimination of the change in fair value of AFG's investments in the CLOs, including $29 million and $28 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in distributions recorded as interest expense by the CLOs. \n (c) Elimination of management fees earned by AFG. \nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATING STATEMENT OF EARNINGS - CONTINUED\n\n (a) Includes $16 million representing the change in fair value of AFG's CLO investments plus $25 million in CLO management fees earned. \n (b) Elimination of the change in fair value of AFG's investments in the CLOs, including $23 million in distributions recorded as interest expense by the CLOs. \n (c) Elimination of management fees earned by AFG. \n (d) Allocate losses of CLOs attributable to other debt holders to noncontrolling interests. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral AFG's net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. For example, core net operating earnings excludes realized gains (losses) on securities because such gains and losses are influenced significantly by financial markets, interest rates and the timing of sales. Similarly, significant gains and losses from the sale of real estate are excluded from core earnings as they are influenced by the timing of sales and realized gains (losses) and significant tax benefits (charges) related to subsidiaries are excluded because such gains and losses are largely the result of the changing business strategy and market opportunities. In addition, special charges related to coverage that AFG no longer writes, such as the Neon exited lines and for asbestos and environmental exposures are excluded from core earnings. The following table (in millions, except per share amounts) identifies non-core items and reconciles net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure. AFG believes core net operating earnings is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends and for management to evaluate financial performance against historical results because it believes this provides a more comparable measure of its continuing business.\n\nNet earnings attributable to shareholders increased $256 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to the fourth quarter 2016 tax benefits related to the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring, net realized gains on securities in the 2016 period compared to net realized losses on securities in the 2015 period and higher core net operating earnings. Core net operating earnings increased $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 reflecting higher operating earnings in the property and casualty and annuity segments.\nNet earnings attributable to shareholders increased $297 million for the full-year of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to the 2016 tax benefits related to the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring, lower special A&E charges recorded in 2016 compared to 2015, net realized gains on securities in 2016 compared to net realized losses on securities in 2015, the estimated loss on the sale of the subsidiaries containing substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015 and higher core net operating earnings, partially offset by a charge related to the exit of certain lines of business within Neon, and lower gains on the sale of real estate in 2016 compared to 2015. Core net operating earnings increased $48 million in 2016 compared to 2015 reflecting higher underwriting profit and net investment income in the ongoing property and casualty insurance operations and higher earnings in the annuity segment, partially offset by lower profitability in the run-off long-term care and life segment and higher holding company expenses.\nNet earnings attributable to shareholders decreased $100 million for the full-year of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to the loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business, higher special A&E charges and net realized losses on securities in 2015 compared to net realized gains on securities in 2014, partially offset by the gain on the sale of a hotel and an apartment property and higher core net operating earnings. Core net operating earnings increased $47 million for the full-year of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to higher underwriting profit and higher net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment and improved core operating results in the run-off long-term care and life segment.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015\nSegmented Statement of Earnings AFG reports its business as four segments: (i) Property and casualty insurance ( P&C\u201d), (ii) Annuity, (iii) Run-off long-term care and life and (iv) Other, which includes holding company costs and income and expenses related to the managed investment entities ( MIEs\u201d).\nAFG's net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. The following tables for the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 identify such items by segment and reconcile net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure that AFG believes is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends (in millions):\n\n\n (a) See the reconciliation of core earnings to GAAP net earnings under Results of Operations - General\u201d for details on the tax and noncontrolling interest impacts of these reconciling items. \nProperty and Casualty Insurance Segment - Results of Operations Performance measures such as underwriting profit or loss and related combined ratios are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance. Underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio, which is a sum of the ratios of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and commissions and other underwriting expenses to premiums. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. The combined ratio does not reflect net investment income, other income, other expenses or federal income taxes.\nAFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $182 million in GAAP pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $179 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $3 million (2%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $182 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of\n$18 million (11%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit in the Property and transportation and Specialty financial insurance sub-segments and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty sub-segment. GAAP earnings also includes a $15 million pretax gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty insurance operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):\n\nAFG's combined ratio has been better than the industry average for 29 of the last 31 years. Management believes that AFG's insurance operations have performed better than the industry as a result of its specialty niche focus, product line diversification, stringent underwriting discipline and alignment of compensation incentives.\nAFG reports the underwriting performance of its Specialty property and casualty insurance business in the following sub-segments: (i) Property and transportation, (ii) Specialty casualty and (iii) Specialty financial.\nTo understand the overall profitability of particular lines, the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered. Certain short-tail\u201d lines of business (primarily property coverages) generally have quick loss payouts, which reduce the time funds are held, thereby limiting investment income earned thereon. In contrast, long-tail\u201d lines of business (primarily liability coverages and workers' compensation) generally have payouts that are either structured over many years or take many years to settle, thereby significantly increasing investment income earned on related premiums received.\nGross Written Premiums\nGross written premiums ( GWP\u201d) for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment were $1.44 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $1.36 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $85 million (6%). Detail of AFG's property and casualty gross written premiums is shown below (dollars in millions):\n\nReinsurance Premiums Ceded\nReinsurance premiums ceded ( Ceded\u201d) for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment were 25% of gross written premiums for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 22% for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 3 percentage points. Detail of AFG's property and casualty reinsurance premiums ceded is shown below (dollars in millions):\n\nNet Written Premiums\nNet written premiums ( NWP\u201d) for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment were $1.08 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $1.06 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $27 million (3%). Detail of AFG's property and casualty net written premiums is shown below (dollars in millions):\n\nNet Earned Premiums\nNet earned premiums ( NEP\u201d) for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment were $1.14 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $1.12 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $24 million (2%). Detail of AFG's property and casualty net earned premiums is shown below (dollars in millions):\n\nThe $85 million increase in gross written premiums in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects growth in each of the Specialty property and casualty insurance sub-segments. Overall average renewal rates were up 1% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nProperty and transportation Gross written premiums increased $62 million (12%) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was due primarily to higher year-over-year gross written premiums in the crop business. Excluding crop, gross written premiums were comparable to the prior year period. Average renewal rates increased approximately 2% for this group in the fourth quarter of 2016, including a 4% increase in National Interstate's renewal rates. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 5 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting higher cessions in the crop business, primarily related to growth in a rainfall-related product, which is heavily reinsured.\nSpecialty casualty Gross written premiums increased $23 million (3%) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Higher gross written premiums in the targeted markets and executive liability businesses were partially offset by lower premiums in the excess and surplus lines operations, primarily the result of more stringent underwriting standards related to New York contractors business, as well as lower premiums within the workers' compensation businesses. Average renewal rates for this group were flat in the fourth quarter of 2016, and include a decrease of approximately 2% in the workers' compensation business. Excluding the workers' compensation business, average renewal rates for this group increased approximately 1% during the quarter. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 1 percentage point for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting a change in the mix of business.\nSpecialty financial Gross written premiums increased $1 million (1%) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to growth in the fidelity and crime, surety and equipment leasing businesses, partially offset by lower premiums in the financial institutions business. Average renewal rates for this group were down approximately 1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums are comparable between periods.\nOther specialty The amounts shown as reinsurance premiums ceded represent business assumed by AFG's internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG's other Specialty property and casualty insurance sub-segments.\nCombined Ratio\nPerformance measures such as the combined ratio are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) and underwriting expense ratios. These ratios are calculated by dividing each of the respective expenses by net earned premiums. The table below (dollars in millions) details the components of the combined ratio for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment:\n\nThe Specialty property and casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $110 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $10 million (10%). The higher underwriting profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects improved underwriting results in the Property and transportation and Specialty financial sub-segments, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty sub-segment. Overall catastrophe losses were $12 million (1.1 points on the combined ratio) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $9 million (0.8 points on the combined ratio) in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nProperty and transportation Underwriting profit for this group was $75 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $41 million (121%) reflecting higher underwriting profit in the crop insurance business, primarily the result of favorable growing conditions and relatively stable commodity pricing.\nSpecialty casualty Underwriting profit for this group was $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $37 million (74%). This decrease is due primarily to underwriting losses in one of the excess and surplus lines businesses, primarily related to coverage written for New York contractors, and lower profitability in the targeted markets business.\nSpecialty financial Underwriting profit for this group was $20 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $5 million (33%) reflecting higher underwriting profit in the financial institutions, surety and trade credit businesses.\nOther specialty Underwriting profit for this group was $2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $1 million (100%).\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nAFG's overall loss and LAE ratio was 63.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 61.8% for fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 1.9 percentage points. The components of AFG's property and casualty losses and LAE amounts and ratio are detailed below (dollars in millions): \nCurrent accident year losses and LAE, excluding catastrophe losses\nThe current accident year loss and LAE ratio, excluding catastrophe losses for AFG's Specialty property and casualty insurance operations was 61.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 61.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 0.3%.\nProperty and transportation The 4.8 percentage point decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses reflects a decrease in the loss and LAE ratio of the crop business and, to a lesser extent, the equine business and the Singapore branch in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSpecialty casualty The 4.6 percentage point increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses reflects an increase in the loss and LAE ratio of the targeted markets, general liability, excess and surplus and workers' compensation businesses and at Neon.\nSpecialty financial The 2.3 percentage point increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses reflects an increase in the loss and LAE ratio of the financial institutions business.\nNet prior year reserve development\nAFG's Specialty property and casualty insurance operations recorded net adverse reserve development related to prior accident years of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net favorable reserve development related to prior accident years of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nProperty and transportation Net adverse reserve development of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects reserve strengthening at National Interstate and higher than expected claim severity in the ocean marine business. Net adverse reserve development of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects higher than expected claim severity in commercial auto liability insurance at National Interstate and higher than expected claim frequency in the ocean marine business, partially offset by lower than expected claim severity in the property and inland marine business.\nSpecialty casualty Net adverse reserve development of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects higher than anticipated severity in New York contractor claims, adverse reserve development at Neon and higher than anticipated claim severity in the targeted programs business, partially offset by lower than anticipated claim frequency and severity in the workers' compensation businesses. Net favorable reserve development of $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in workers' compensation business, excess liability insurance and directors and officers liability insurance, partially offset by adverse reserve development at Neon.\nSpecialty financial Net favorable reserve development of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects lower than expected claim frequency in the financial institutions business and lower than anticipated claim severity in the fidelity and crime business. Net favorable reserve development of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the fidelity business, lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the surety business and lower than expected claim severity on a run-off block of collateral value insurance, partially offset by higher than expected claim severity in products for financial institutions and in the trade credit business.\nOther specialty In addition to the reserve development discussed above, total Specialty prior year reserve development includes net favorable reserve development of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting amortization of the deferred gain on the retroactive insurance transaction entered into in connection with the sale of businesses in 1998 and 2001 and reserve development associated with AFG's internal reinsurance program.\nCatastrophe losses\nAFG generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and the purchase of reinsurance. Based on data available at December 31, 2016, AFG's exposure to a catastrophic earthquake or windstorm that industry models indicate could occur once in every 500 years (a 500-year event\u201d) is expected to be less than 4% of AFG's Shareholders' Equity. Catastrophe losses of $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 resulted primarily from Hurricane Matthew. The $5 million of catastrophe losses in the Specialty financial group in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted primarily from flooding in the midwestern United States.\nCommissions and Other Underwriting Expenses\nAFG's property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses ( U/W Exp\u201d) were $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $327 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $22 million (7%). AFG's underwriting expense ratio, calculated as commissions and other underwriting expenses divided by net premiums earned, was 26.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 29.2% for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 2.5 percentage points. Detail of AFG's property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses and underwriting expense ratios is shown below (dollars in millions):\n\nAFG's overall expense ratio decreased 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting an increase in ceding commissions received from reinsurers.\nProperty and transportation Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 5.4 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting an increase in ceding commissions received from reinsurers in the crop business.\nSpecialty casualty Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums increased 0.1 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSpecialty financial Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 2.3 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting an increase in ceding commissions received from reinsurers and the impact of higher premiums on the ratio in the financial institutions business.\nProperty and Casualty Net Investment Income\nNet investment income in AFG's property and casualty operations was $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $11 million (15%). In recent years, yields available in the financial markets on fixed maturity securities have generally declined, placing downward pressure on AFG's investment portfolio yield. The average invested assets and overall yield earned on investments held by AFG's property and casualty operations are provided below (dollars in millions): \n (*) Adjusts the yield on equity securities and tax-exempt bonds to the fully taxable equivalent yield. \nThe increase in average invested assets in the property and casualty insurance segment for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 is due primarily to growth in the property and casualty insurance segment. The property and casualty insurance segment's overall yield on investments (net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets) was 3.48% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 3.25% for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 0.23 percentage points, reflecting a $5 million increase in income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings and an $8 million increase in equity in the earnings of limited partnerships and similar investments, partially offset by slightly higher investment expenses and lower yields available in the financial markets. The 7% increase in average invested assets in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects a higher average balance in cash and cash equivalents.\nProperty and Casualty Other Income and Expenses, Net\nGAAP other income and expenses, net for AFG's property and casualty operations was a net expense of $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net income of $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $18 million (360%). Core other income and expenses, net for AFG's property and casualty operations was a net expense of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $3 million (30%). The table below details the items included in GAAP and core other income and expenses, net for AFG's property and casualty operations (in millions): \n (*) Excludes the $15 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015. \nAFG and its consolidated subsidiaries incurred $5 million in transaction expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to GAI's acquisition of the NATL common stock that it did not already own. These expenses consisted primarily of financial advisory and legal services. See Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements.\nInterest expense for AFG's property and casualty operations includes interest charges on long-term debt within the property and casualty operations.\nAnnuity Segment - Results of Operations\nAFG's annuity operations contributed $132 million in pretax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $31 million (31%). AFG's annuity segment results for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflect higher investment income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings and an 11% increase in average annuity investments (at amortized cost). In addition, the annuity segment's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 benefitted from the positive impact of a significant increase in interest rates on the fair value accounting for fixed-indexed annuities ( FIAs\u201d). Both periods reflect the positive impact of strong stock market performance on fair value accounting for FIAs. These improved results were partially offset by the impact of lower investment yields due to the run-off of higher yielding investments. AFG's periodic detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations resulted in a net annuity expense reduction of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe following table details AFG's earnings before income taxes from its annuity operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):\n\nDetail of annuity earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions):\n\n (*) Annuity benefits consisted of the following (dollars in millions): \n\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity benefit expense.\nThe profitability of a fixed annuity business is largely dependent on the ability of a company to earn income on the assets supporting the business in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts plus expenses incurred (earning a spread\u201d). Performance measures such as net interest spread and net spread earned are often presented by annuity businesses to help users of their financial statements better understand the company's performance.\nNet Spread on Fixed Annuities (excludes variable annuity earnings)\nThe table below (dollars in millions) details the components of these spreads for AFG's fixed annuity operations (including fixed-indexed annuities):\n\nThe table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment's net spread earned on fixed annuities:\n\n (*) An estimate of the related acceleration/deceleration of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements. \nAnnuity Net Investment Income\nNet investment income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $346 million compared to $309 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $37 million (12%). This increase reflects primarily the growth in AFG's annuity business and higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by the impact of lower investment yields. The overall yield earned on investments in AFG's fixed annuity operations, calculated as net investment income divided by average investment balances (at amortized cost), increased by 0.07 percentage points to 4.72% from 4.65% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase in net investment yield reflects higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by (i) the investment of new premium dollars at lower yields as compared to the existing investment portfolio and (ii) the impact of the reinvestment of proceeds from maturity and redemption of higher yielding investments at the lower yields available in the financial markets. During 2016, $4.0 billion in annuity segment investments with an average yield of 5.51% were redeemed or sold while the investments purchased during 2016 (with new premium dollars and the redemption/sale proceeds) had an average yield at purchase of 4.21%.\nAnnuity Interest Credited - Fixed\nInterest credited - fixed for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $148 million compared to $138 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $10 million (7%). The impact of growth in the annuity business was partially offset by lower interest crediting rates on new premiums as compared to the crediting rates on policyholder funds surrendered or withdrawn. The average interest rate credited to policyholders, calculated as interest credited divided by average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, decreased 0.10 percentage points to 2.02% from 2.12% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nAnnuity Net Interest Spread\nAFG's net interest spread increased 0.17 percentage points to 2.70% from 2.53% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to the impact of lower crediting rates and higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by lower in-force investment yields. Features included in current annuity product offerings allow AFG to achieve its desired profitability at a lower net interest spread than historical product offerings. As a result, AFG expects its net interest spread to narrow in the future.\nAnnuity Policy Charges and Other Miscellaneous Income\nAnnuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income, which consist primarily of surrender charges, amortization of deferred upfront policy charges (unearned revenue) and income from sales of real estate were $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $2 million (18%). The fourth quarter of 2016 includes gains of $2 million from the sale of real estate. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges related to unearned revenue, annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated were 0.15% in both the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income.\nOther Annuity Benefits, Net of Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit Fees\nOther annuity benefits, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees (excluding the impact of unlocking) for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $28 million compared to $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $9 million (47%). As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these net expenses increased 0.07 percentage points to 0.38% from 0.31% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition to interest credited to policyholders' accounts and the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, annuity benefits expense also includes the following expenses (in millions, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees): \nAs discussed under Annuity Benefits Accumulated\u201d in Note A - Accounting Policies\u201d to the financial statements, guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserves are accrued for and modified using assumptions similar to those used in establishing and amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs. The guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve related to FIAs can be inversely impacted by the calculated FIA embedded derivative reserve as the value to policyholders of the guaranteed withdrawal benefits decreases when the benefit of stock market participation increases.\nAnnuity Acquisition Expenses\nExcluding the impact of unlocking charges (expense reductions) discussed under Annuity Unlocking\u201d below, AFG's amortization of DPAC and commission expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated was 1.06% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 0.75% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and has generally ranged between 0.75% and 0.85%. Variances from the general range relate primarily to the impact of (i) material changes in interest rates or the stock market on AFG's fixed-indexed annuity business, and (ii) differences in actual experience from actuarially projected estimates and assumptions. For example, the positive impact of the significantly higher than anticipated interest rates and strong stock market performance during the fourth quarter of 2016 on the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (discussed below) resulted in a partially offsetting acceleration in the amortization of DPAC. During the third quarter of 2015, the deceleration in the amortization of DPAC caused by the negative impact of poor stock market performance on the fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities was limited on certain recently issued products. This prior period limitation had a $5 million favorable impact on the amortization of DPAC related to the fair value accounting for those derivatives when the stock market rebounded during the fourth quarter of 2015. This favorable impact is reported in the impact on DPAC of derivatives related to FIAs.\nThe table below illustrates the estimated impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on annuity acquisition expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated:\n\n (*) An estimate of the acceleration/deceleration in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs resulting from fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities. \nAnnuity Other Expenses\nAnnuity other expenses were $27 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $5 million (23%). Annuity other expenses represent primarily general and administrative expenses, as well as selling and issuance expenses that are not deferred. The increase in annuity other expenses reflects primarily growth in the business and an increase in the number of sales personnel focused on new initiatives and increased market share within existing financial institutions and retail marketing organizations in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. As\na percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these expenses increased 0.03 percentage points to 0.35% from 0.32% for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives Related to Fixed-Indexed Annuities\nAFG's fixed-indexed annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing stock market index. AFG attempts to mitigate the risk in the index-based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index. AFG's strategy is designed so that the change in the fair value of the call option assets will generally offset the economic change in the liabilities from the index participation. Both the index-based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives that must be adjusted for changes in fair value through earnings each period. The fair values of these derivatives are impacted by actual and expected stock market performance and interest rates as well as other factors. For a list of other factors impacting the fair value of the index-based component of AFG's annuity benefits accumulated, see Note D - Fair Value Measurements\u201d to the financial statements. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges, the net change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities decreased annuity benefits by $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and had a nominal impact on annuity benefits in the fourth quarter of 2015. The $54 million decrease in annuity benefits in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects the positive impact of significantly higher than anticipated interest rates and strong market performance on the fair value of these derivatives. As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, this net expense reduction increased 0.71 percentage points to 0.73% in the fourth quarter of 2016 from 0.02% in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFluctuations in interest rates and the stock market, among other factors, can cause volatility in the periodic measurement of fair value of the embedded derivative that management believes can be inconsistent with the long-term economics of these products. The table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions):\n\n (*) An estimate of the related acceleration/deceleration of amortization of deferred sales inducements and deferred policy acquisition costs. \nAs illustrated in the table above, the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, including the related impact on amortization of DPAC, increased the annuity segment's earnings before income taxes by $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and by $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSee Annuity Unlocking\u201d below for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses. Unanticipated spread compression, decreases in the stock market, adverse mortality experience, and higher than expected lapse rates could lead to future write-offs of DPAC or the present value of future profits on business in force of companies acquired ( PVFP\u201d).\nAnnuity Net Spread Earned on Fixed Annuities\nAFG's net spread earned on fixed annuities increased 0.43 percentage points to 1.82% from 1.39% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to the net impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives and related DPAC amortization offset discussed above and the 0.17 percentage points increase in AFG's net interest spread.\nAnnuity Benefits Accumulated\nAnnuity premiums received and benefit payments are recorded as increases or decreases in annuity benefits accumulated rather than as revenue and expense. Increases in this liability for interest credited and other benefits are charged to expense and decreases for surrender and other policy charges are credited to other income.\nFor certain products, annuity benefits accumulated also includes reserves for accrued persistency and premium bonuses, excess benefits expected to be paid on future deaths and annuitizations ( EDAR\u201d) and guaranteed withdrawal benefits. Annuity benefits accumulated also includes amounts advanced from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. The following table is a progression of AFG's annuity benefits accumulated liability for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\n\nStatutory Annuity Premiums\nAFG's annuity operations generated statutory premiums of $1.11 billion in both the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015. The following table summarizes AFG's annuity sales (dollars in millions):\n\nAFG continues to implement product and process changes needed to comply with the Department of Labor ( DOL\u201d) fiduciary rule and is proceeding under the premise the DOL rule becomes effective in April 2017 in its current form. There is considerable discussion surrounding the possibility of a delay or other action impacting the rule. On February 9, 2017, the DOL filed a notice with the Office of Management and Budget to delay implementation of the regulation. However, until there is some definitive action impacting the rule, AFG intends to continue to pursue necessary changes.\nAssuming the rule becomes effective in its current form, AFG believes the biggest impact will be on insurance-only licensed agents whose sales represented less than 10% of its fourth quarter annuity premium. While AFG's management continues to believe the adjustments required of AFG and its distribution partners to comply with the rule will impact 2017 annuity premiums, management does not believe the new rule will have a material impact on AFG's results of operations.\nAnnuity Unlocking\nIn the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, AFG conducted a detailed review ( unlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations. As a result of these reviews, AFG recorded net expense reductions related to its annuity business of $1 million in 2016 and $10 million in 2015, which impacted AFG's financial statements as follows (in millions):\n\nThe net expense reduction from unlocking annuity assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects the favorable impact of an increase in projected net interest spreads on in-force business, substantially offset by the unfavorable impact of (i) changes in projected policyholder annuitization and lapse behavior, (ii) an increase in the risk premium for the uncertainty in the cash flows component of the discount rates used to value the FIA-related embedded derivative and (iii) a slight decrease in projected stock market growth over the next three years. Reinvestment rate assumptions are based primarily on 7-year and 10-year corporate bond yields. For the 2016 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 4.24% in 2017, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.55% in 2022 and beyond.\nThe table below compares the reinvestment rate assumed in AFG's fourth quarter unlockings for the next calendar year to the actual reinvestment rate achieved in that period (both net of investment expenses):\n\n (*) Assumed reinvestment rates exclude default rates of 0.18% in each period. \nManagement believes that these results demonstrate that AFG's reinvestment rate assumptions are reasonable and prudently conservative. In addition to the reinvestment rates above, actual default rates in 2015 and 2016 were lower than the long-term default rates of 0.18% assumed in the unlocking in each of the periods above.\nThe 2015 net expense reduction was due primarily to the impact of changes in assumptions to reflect higher than previously projected net interest spreads as well as the impact of higher assets under management and expense discipline. For the 2015 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 3.87% in 2016, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.53% in 2022 and beyond.\nAnnuity Earnings before Income Taxes Reconciliation\nThe following table reconciles the net spread earned on AFG's fixed annuities to overall annuity pretax earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\n\n (*) Net investment income (as a % of investments) of 4.72% and 4.65% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, multiplied by the difference between average fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost) and average fixed annuity benefits accumulated in each period. \nRun-off Long-Term Care and Life Segment - Results of Operations AFG's run-off long-term care and life segment reported GAAP pretax earnings of $2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Results for the 2015 period include a $4 million pretax non-core realized loss adjustment to the previously recognized $162 million estimated pretax loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. See Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements. The following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings (loss) before income taxes from its run-off long-term care and life operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):\n\nThe decrease in long-term care net earned premiums and benefit expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 is due to the sale of subsidiaries containing substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business in December of 2015.\nHolding Company, Other and Unallocated - Results of Operations AFG's net pretax loss outside of its insurance operations (excluding realized gains and losses) totaled $50 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $45 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $5 million (11%).\nThe following table details AFG's loss before income taxes from operations outside of its insurance operations for three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions): \nHolding Company and Other - Net Investment Income\nAFG recorded net investment income on investments held outside of its insurance operations of less than $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nHolding Company and Other - P&C Fees and Related Expenses\nSummit, the workers' compensation insurance business that AFG acquired in April 2014, collects fees from a small group of unaffiliated insurers for providing underwriting, policy administration and claims services. In addition, certain of AFG's property and casualty businesses collect fees from customers for ancillary services such as workplace safety programs and premium financing. In the fourth quarter of 2016, AFG collected $17 million in fees for these services compared to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Management views this fee income, net of the $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, in expenses incurred to generate such fees, as a reduction in the cost of underwriting its property and casualty insurance policies. Consistent with internal management reporting, these fees and the related expenses are netted and recorded as a reduction of commissions and other underwriting expenses in AFG's segmented results.\nHolding Company and Other - Other Income\nOther income in the table above includes $5 million and $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, in management fees paid to AFG by the AFG-managed CLOs (AFG's consolidated managed investment entities). The management fees are eliminated in consolidation - see the other income line in the Consolidate MIEs column under Results of Operations - Segmented Statement of Earnings.\u201d Excluding amounts eliminated in consolidation, AFG recorded other income outside of its insurance operations of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nHolding Company and Other - Interest Charges on Borrowed Money\nAFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $5 million (31%). This increase reflects higher average indebtedness, partially offset by lower average interest rates on outstanding debt. The following table details the principal amount of AFG's long-term debt balances as of October 1, 2016 compared to October 1, 2015 (dollars in millions):\n\nThe increase in average indebtedness for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects the following financing transactions completed by AFG between October 1, 2015 and October 1, 2016:\n \u2022 Issued $300 million of 3.50% Senior Notes on August 22, 2016. \n \u2022 Issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures on November 17, 2015. \nHolding Company and Other - Other Expenses\nAFG's holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded other expenses of $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $1 million (3%).\nConsolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities AFG's consolidated realized gains (losses) on securities, which are not allocated to segments, were gains of $51 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to losses of $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $72 million (343%). Realized gains (losses) on securities consisted of the following (in millions):\n\nAFG's impairment charges on securities for the fourth quarter of 2016 consist of $10 million on equity securities and $1 million on fixed maturities compared to $46 million on equity securities, $11 million on fixed maturities and $3 million on other investments in the fourth quarter of 2015. Approximately $7 million in impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2016 are related to an equity investment in a pharmaceutical company. Approximately $26 million of the charges in the fourth quarter of 2015 are attributable to real estate and mortgage related investments, $12 million are on investments in asset managers and $8 million are on energy related investments.\nConsolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Subsidiaries The $4 million pretax realized loss on subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2015 represents an adjustment to the previously recognized $162 million estimated pretax loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG's run-off long-term care insurance business that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015.\nConsolidated Income Taxes AFG's consolidated provision (credit) for income taxes was a benefit of $71 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to an expense of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $151 million (189%). The following is a reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory rate of 35% to the provision (credit) for income taxes as shown in the segmented statement of earnings (dollars in millions):\n\nThe changes in valuation allowance in the table above are primarily increases in the valuation allowance on tax benefits related to losses in the Neon Lloyd's insurance business. Due to the uncertainty concerning the realization of the deferred tax benefits associated with these losses, AFG maintains a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets.\nAs discussed in Note B - Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses\u201d to the financial statements, AFG acquired the noncontrolling interest in National Interstate Corporation in November 2016. This transaction allowed National Interstate and its subsidiaries to become members of the AFG consolidated tax group, which resulted in a tax benefit of $66 million to AFG during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn connection with the ongoing reorganization of AFG's Neon Lloyd's business, in December 2016, AFG undertook a restructuring that included the liquidation for tax purposes of the foreign subsidiary that is the parent of the Neon Lloyd's operations, resulting in a taxable loss for U.S. tax purposes. AFG reported the $111 million tax benefit associated with this loss in the fourth quarter of 2016. See Note L - Income Taxes\u201d to the financial statements.\nExcluding the tax benefit related to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in NATL and the tax benefit related to the Neon restructuring, AFG's effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was 33%.\nConsolidated Noncontrolling Interests AFG's consolidated net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014\nSegmented Statement of Earnings AFG reports its business as four segments: (i) Property and casualty insurance ( P&C\u201d), (ii) Annuity, (iii) Run-off long-term care and life and (iv) Other, which includes holding company costs and income and expenses related to the managed investment entities ( MIEs\u201d).\nAFG's net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. The following tables for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 identify such items by segment and reconcile net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure that AFG believes is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends (in millions):\n\n\n\n (a) See the reconciliation of core earnings to GAAP net earnings under Results of Operations - General\u201d for details on the tax and noncontrolling interest impacts of these reconciling items. \nProperty and Casualty Insurance Segment - Results of Operations AFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $577 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2016 compared to $576 million in 2015, an increase of $1 million. Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $646 million in 2016 compared to $577 million in 2015, an increase of $69 million (12%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects improved underwriting results in the Property and transportation group and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty and Specialty financial groups. GAAP pretax earnings also reflect a pretax non-core charge of $65 million in the second quarter of 2016 related to the exit of certain lines of business within Neon and a $32 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a $51 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of a hotel in the second quarter of 2015 and a $15 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as non-core special A&E charges of $36 million in 2016 compared to $67 million in 2015.\nAFG's property and casualty insurance operations contributed $576 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 compared to $456 million in 2014, an increase of $120 million (26%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $577 million in 2015\ncompared to $480 million in 2014, an increase of $97 million (20%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit across each of AFG's property and casualty insurance sub-segments, higher net investment income (due primarily to the investment of cash acquired in the Summit acquisition on April 1, 2014) and lower net expenses. The increase in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 also reflects pretax non-core gains of $51 million on the sale of a hotel and $15 million on the sale of an apartment property, partially offset by higher non-core special A&E charges in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nThe following table details AFG's GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty insurance operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):\n\nAFG reports the underwriting performance of its Specialty property and casualty insurance business in the following sub-segments: (i) Property and transportation, (ii) Specialty casualty and (iii) Specialty financial.\nGross Written Premiums\nGross written premiums ( GWP\u201d) for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment were $5.98 billion in 2016 compared to $5.83 billion in 2015, an increase of $149 million (3%). GWP increased $355 million (6%) in 2015 compared to 2014. Detail of AFG's property and casualty gross written premiums is shown below (dollars in millions):\n\nReinsurance Premiums Ceded\nReinsurance premiums ceded ( Ceded\u201d) for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment were 27%, 26% and 27% of gross written premiums for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Detail of AFG's property and casualty reinsurance premiums ceded is shown below (dollars in millions):\n\nNet Written Premiums\nNet written premiums ( NWP\u201d) for AFG's property and casualty insurance segment were $4.39 billion in 2016 compared to $4.33 billion in 2015, an increase of $59 million (1%). NWP increased $307 million (8%) in 2015 compared to 2014. Detail of AFG's property and casualty net written premiums is shown below (dollars in millions):\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
