MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with \"Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to our plans, estimates, beliefs and anticipated future financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors,\" \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and elsewhere in this filing.\nOverview\nWe believe we are the leading global provider of neutral-host commercial mobile Wi-Fi Internet solutions and indoor DAS services in the world. Our software applications and solutions enable individuals to access our extensive global Wi-Fi networks that cover more than 1.5 million hotspots. We operate 36 DAS networks containing approximately 19,200 nodes. Our offerings provide compelling cost and performance advantages to our customers and partners.\nWe grew revenue from $139.6 million in 2015 to $159.3 million in 2016, an increase of 14.1%. We grew revenue from $119.3 million in 2014 to $139.6 million in 2015, an increase of 17.0%. We generated a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $27.3 million in 2016 compared to $22.3 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased from $29.6 million in 2015 to $40.8 million in 2016, an increase of 37.7%. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nThe proliferation of smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables, and other Wi-Fi enabled devices-in conjunction with the increased consumption of high-bandwidth activities like video, online gaming, streaming, cloud-based applications and mobile apps-has created a demand for high-speed, high-bandwidth Internet access in public places both large and small. These data intensive activities are driving a global surge in mobile Internet data traffic that is expected to increase nearly seven-fold between 2016 and 2021, according to Cisco's Visual Networking Index. We believe these trends present us with opportunities to generate significant growth in revenue and profitability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, goodwill, measuring recoverability of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we believe the accounting policies discussed below are paramount to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our management's judgments, assumptions and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from several sources including: (i) DAS customers that are telecom operators under long-term contracts for access to our DAS at our managed and operated locations, (ii) military and retail customers under subscription plans for month-to-month network access that automatically renew, and military and retail single-use access from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access plans, (iii) arrangements with wholesale Wi-Fi customers that provide software licensing, network access, and/or professional services fees, and (iv) display advertisements and sponsorships on our walled garden sign-in pages. Software licensed by our wholesale Wi-Fi platform services customers can only be used during the term of the service arrangements and has no utility to them upon termination of the service arrangement.\nWe recognize revenue when an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, fees are fixed or determinable, no significant obligations remain related to the earned fees and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue is presented net of any sales and value added taxes.\nRevenue generated from access to our DAS networks consists of build-out fees and recurring access fees under certain long-term contracts with telecom operators. Build-out fees paid upfront are generally deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the estimated customer relationship period, once the build-out is complete. Periodically, we install and sell Wi-Fi and DAS networks to customers where we do not have service contracts or remaining obligations beyond the installation of those networks and we recognize build-out fees for such projects as revenue when the installation work is completed and the network has been accepted by the customer. Minimum monthly access fees for usage of the DAS networks are non-cancellable and generally escalate on an annual basis. These minimum monthly access fees are recognized ratably over the term of the telecom operator agreement. The initial term of our contracts with telecom operators generally range from five to twenty years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue from DAS network access fees in excess of the monthly minimums is recognized when earned.\nSubscription fees from military and retail customers are paid monthly in advance and revenue is deferred for the portions of monthly recurring subscription fees collected in advance. We provide refunds for our military and retail services on a case-by-case basis. These amounts are not significant and are recorded as contra-revenue in the period the refunds are made. Subscription fee revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue generated from military and retail single-use access is recognized when access is provided.\nServices provided to wholesale Wi-Fi partners generally contain several elements including: (i) a term license to use our software to access our Wi-Fi network, (ii) access fees for Wi-Fi network usage, and/or (iii) professional services for software integration and customization and to maintain the Wi-Fi service. The term license, monthly minimum network access fees and professional services are billed on a monthly basis based upon predetermined fixed rates. Once the term license for integration and customization are delivered, the fees from the arrangement are recognized ratably over the remaining term of the service arrangement. The initial term of the license agreements is generally between one to five years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue for Wi-Fi network access fees in excess of the monthly minimum amounts is recognized when earned. All elements within existing service arrangements are generally delivered and earned concurrently throughout the term of the respective service arrangement.\nIn instances where the minimum monthly Wi-Fi and DAS network access fees escalate over the term of the wholesale service arrangement, an unbilled receivable is recognized when performance is within our control and when we have reasonable assurance that the unbilled receivable balance will be collected.\nWe adopted the provisions of ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (\"ASU 2009-13\"), on a prospective basis on January 1, 2011. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under FASB ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, we defer recognition of revenue for the full arrangement and recognize all revenue ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements, as we did not have evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements in the arrangement. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under ASC 605-25, we evaluate whether or not separate units of accounting exist and then allocate the arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method using estimated selling prices if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. We recognize the revenue associated with the separate units of accounting upon completion of such services or ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements.\nAdvertising revenue is generated from advertisements on our managed and operated or partner networks. In determining whether an arrangement exists, we ensure that a binding arrangement is in place, such as a standard insertion order or a fully executed customer-specific agreement. Obligations pursuant to our advertising revenue arrangements typically include a minimum number of units or the satisfaction of certain performance criteria. Advertising and other revenue is recognized when the services are performed.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying value. We perform our impairment test annually as of December 31st. Entities have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If, after assessing qualitative factors, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If deemed necessary, a two-step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; otherwise, there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired and the amount of the loss, if any, is measured by performing step two. Under step two, the impairment loss, if any, is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we tested our goodwill for impairment using a market based approach and no impairment was identified as the fair value of our sole reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount. To date, we have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges.\nMeasuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets are depreciated and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related asset type using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for property and equipment are as follows:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2 to 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Computer equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2 to 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Furniture, fixtures and office equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3 to 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leasehold improvements\n</td> <td> </td> <td>The shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining term of the agreements, generally ranging from 2 to 18 years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe perform an impairment review of long-lived assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business and/or product strategies and significant industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these indicators, we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate or other indices of fair value. We would then recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation consists of stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), which are granted to employees and non-employees. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value on a straight-line basis, net of forfeitures, over the employee requisite service period. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met. The grant date fair value of our stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided based on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted. The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized.\nWe may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.\nWe establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We evaluate the need for, and the adequacy of, valuation allowances based on the expected realization of our deferred tax assets. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include historical earnings, our latest forecast of taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.\nOur effective tax rates are primarily affected by changes in our valuation allowances, the amount of our taxable income or losses in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, the amount of federal and state net operating losses and tax credits, the extent to which we can utilize these net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits and certain benefits related to stock option activity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 \"Significant Accounting Policies\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to monitoring traditional financial measures, we also monitor our operating performance using key performance indicators. Our key performance indicators follow:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DAS nodes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscribers-military\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscribers-retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connects\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,413 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDAS nodes. This metric represents the number of active DAS nodes as of the end of the period. A DAS node is a single communications endpoint, typically an antenna, which transmits or receives radio frequency signals wirelessly. This measure is an indicator of the reach of our DAS network. We are experiencing strong customer demand from telecom operators to gain access to our DAS networks; accordingly, we expect to continue to invest in securing, building out and upgrading our DAS networks to meet this demand.\nSubscribers-military and Subscribers-retail. These metrics represent the number of paying customers who are on a month-to-month subscription plan at a given period end. Military subscribers have increased as we deploy our service on new military bases. We also expect to see modest increases in military subscribers as we increase signups for new customers on existing military bases through targeted marketing and by continuing to build the Boingo brand in the military vertical. Retail subscribers have continued to decline as we have expanded our product offerings and enhanced our focus on our wholesale and advertising service offerings.\nConnects. This metric shows how often individuals connect to our global Wi-Fi network in a given period. The connects include wholesale and retail customers in both customer pay locations and customer free locations where we are a paid service provider or receive sponsorship or promotion fees. We count each connect as a single connect regardless of how many times that individual accesses the network at a given venue during their 24 hour period. This measure is an indicator of paid activity throughout our network.\nKey Components of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of DAS revenue, military revenue, retail revenue, wholesale revenue, and advertising and other revenue.\nDAS. We generate revenue from telecom operator partners that pay us network build-out fees, inclusive of network upgrades, and access fees for our DAS and small cell networks.\nMilitary and retail. We generate revenue from sales to military and retail individuals of month-to-month network access subscriptions that automatically renew, primarily through charge card transactions. We also generate revenue from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access to military and retail individuals primarily through charge card transactions.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. We generate revenue from wholesale Wi-Fi partners that license our software and pay usage-based monthly network access fees to allow their customers to access our global Wi-Fi network. Usage-based network access fees may be measured in minutes, connects, megabytes or gigabytes, and in most cases are subject to minimum volume commitments. Other wholesale Wi-Fi partners pay us monthly fees to provide a Wi-Fi infrastructure that we install, manage and operate at their venues for their customers under a service provider arrangement.\nAdvertising and other. We generate revenue from advertisers that seek to reach visitors to our landing pages at our managed and operated network locations with online advertising, promotional and sponsored programs and at locations where we solely provide authorized access to a partner's Wi-Fi network through sponsored access and promotional programs. In addition, we receive revenue from partners in certain venues where we manage and operate the Wi-Fi network.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, entities affiliated with AT&T Inc. accounted for 12%, 17% and 15%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, entities affiliated with Sprint Corporation accounted for 11% of total revenue. The loss of these groups and the customers could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nWe classify our costs and operating expenses as network access, network operations, development and technology, selling and marketing, general and administrative, and amortization of intangible assets. Network access costs consist primarily of payments to venues and network partners in our network. Other costs and operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, costs for contracted labor and development, marketing, legal, accounting and consulting services, and other professional service fees. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. Facilities costs are generally allocated based on headcount. Depreciation and amortization expenses associated with specifically identifiable property and equipment are allocated to the appropriate expense categories.\nNetwork access. Network access costs consist of revenue share payments to venue owners where our managed and operated hotspots are located, usage-based fees to our roaming network partners for access to their networks, depreciation of equipment related to network build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, sale of equipment, and bandwidth and other Internet connectivity expenses in our managed and operated locations.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses consist of costs for our customer service department and for our operations staff who design, build, monitor and maintain our networks. Also included are expenses for our customer service provider that handles customer care inquiries and expenses for network operations contractors, equipment depreciation, and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses consist of costs for our product development and engineering departments, developers and our information systems services staff, depreciation of our equipment and internal-use software, and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist of costs for our business development and marketing employees and executives, travel and entertainment, and marketing programs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of costs for our executive, finance and accounting, legal and human resources personnel, as well as legal, accounting, tax and other professional service fees. Also included are other corporate expenses such as charge card processing fees and bad debt expense.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of acquired venue contracts, technology and non-compete agreements.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, primarily consist of interest income and expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe established a full valuation allowance as a result of our assessment that it was more likely than not that certain federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized and we have continued to maintain the full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests are comprised of minority holdings by third parties in our subsidiaries Chicago Concourse Development Group, LLC (\"CCDG\") and Boingo Holding Participacoes Ltda. (\"BHPL\").\nWe are generally required to pay a portion of allocated net profits less capital expenditures of the preceding year to the non-controlling interest holders of CCDG. The limited liability company agreement for CCDG does not have a term. CCDG can be dissolved upon the unanimous agreement of the members, upon the sale of CCDG, upon declaration of bankruptcy, or upon the termination of the license agreement between CCDG and the City of Chicago.\nWe attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in BHPL under the terms of the limited liability company agreement in proportion to their holdings. The limited liability company agreement with BHPL does not have a term. We, by resolution of the members, may distribute profits against retained earnings or profit reserves existing on the most recent annual balance sheet or may draw up financial statements and distribute profits in shorter periods. BHPL can be dissolved by resolution of the members and as otherwise provided for by law.\nPrior to August 4, 2015, we also had a 70% ownership of Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC (\"CCG Detroit\"). On August 4, 2015, we purchased the remaining 30% ownership interest from the non-controlling interest owners for $1.2 million. We accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of the remaining interest of an entity that had already been majority-owned by the Company. The purchase resulted in a reduction to additional paid-in capital of $1.2 million representing excess purchase price over the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests. In prior years, we attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in CCG Detroit under the terms of the limited liability company agreement. CCG Detroit had generated losses, which had reduced the non-controlling owners capital account to zero in 2009, resulting in an allocation to the controlling interest holder of all operating losses and deficits created by fixed distributions to the non-controlling interest holder. The fixed distributions were terminated during September 2013 concurrent with the termination of CCG Detroit's agreement with Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.\nResults of Operations\nThe

39.5%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense from our increased fixed assets for our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development in those periods.\nStock-based compensation expense\nStock-based compensation expense increased $3.4 million, or 36.3%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in 2015 and 2016.\nFurther, in 2016, our Compensation Committee determined to adjust its practice of making annual long-term equity grants and instead adopted a compensation cycle whereby it granted equity awards to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer covering the number of shares it might otherwise have granted in 2016 through 2018, with \"cliff\" vesting dates in 2019. These grants were made to focus our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer on the Company's overall long-term corporate and strategic goals, eliminate intervening quarterly vesting dates that force them to sell shares in the market to cover taxes triggered upon vesting, and strengthen the Company's ability to retain our senior management team over the next three years. As a result of these larger-than-usual RSU grants, the Compensation Committee does not intend to grant additional equity awards to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer until 2019.\nStock-based compensation expense increased $2.2 million, or 31.2%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in those periods as well as $1.0 million of additional stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2015 resulting from a change in the expected service period for one of our executives, who was terminated. Under the terms of the executive's employment agreement, the executive received 12 months of accelerated vesting credit on unvested stock-based awards.\nWe have shifted our stock-based compensation from stock options to RSUs, which generally vest over a specified service period. We also issue performance-based RSUs to executive personnel. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met.\nAt December 31, 2016, the total remaining stock-based compensation expense for unvested stock option awards is approximately $323,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.8 years. At December 31, 2016, the total remaining stock-based compensation expense for unvested RSU awards is approximately $17,831,000 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the specified periods as a percentage of our revenue for those periods.\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

DAS revenue increased $11.7 million, or 25.2%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to an $8.9 million increase from new build-out projects in our managed and operated locations and a $2.8 million increase in access fees from our telecom operators. DAS build-out revenues in 2016 and 2015 include $0.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of short-term build projects that include sales\nof equipment that were completed during those periods. DAS access fees for 2015 include $0.4 million of one-time fees that were paid for early termination rights.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $20.1 million, or 100.9%, in 2016, as compared to 2015 due to a $16.9 million increase in military subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the increase in military subscribers and a 5.5% increase in the average monthly revenue per military subscriber in 2016 compared to 2015, and a $3.2 million increase in military single-use revenue.\nRetail. Retail revenue decreased $5.1 million, or 16.1%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to a $4.0 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers and a 1.5% decrease in the average monthly revenue per retail subscriber, and a $1.1 million decrease in retail single-use revenue.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue increased $0.3 million, or 1.4%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in wholesale service provider revenue.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue decreased $7.3 million, or 37.1%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $7.9 million decrease in advertising sales at our managed and operated locations resulting from a decline in the number of premium ad units sold.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs and operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network access\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>69,112 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development and technology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(924 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(128 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs and operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>185,441 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>161,257 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>24,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $6.1 million, or 9.7%, in 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $4.3 million increase in depreciation expense related to our increased fixed assets from our DAS build-out projects, a $2.3 million increase in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations and a $0.9 million increase in bandwidth and other direct costs. The increases were partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues and a $0.7 million decrease in other cost of revenue. Other costs of revenue in 2016 and 2015 included $0.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of costs directly related to our short-term DAS projects that were completed during those periods.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $8.8 million, or 26.2%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $4.9 million increase in depreciation expense related to our increased fixed assets, a $2.3 million increase in personnel related expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, a $1.0 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $3.0 million, or 15.6%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in depreciation expense\nrelated to our increased fixed assets, a $0.7 million increase in cloud computing, hardware and software maintenance expenses, and a $0.4 million increase in consulting expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 4.7%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to a $1.4 million decrease in personnel related expenses which was primarily due to a management reorganization that included the elimination of the position of President in January 2016. The decrease was partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in consulting expenses and a $0.2 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $7.4 million, or 32.9%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $5.4 million increase in personnel related expenses, which is inclusive of a $4.0 million increase in stock-based compensation, resulting from increased headcount and the change in the structure and grant cycle of the RSUs granted to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in 2016, $1.4 million expended on our contested proxy election for the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, and a $0.6 million increase in professional fees.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense remained relatively consistent in 2016, as compared to 2015.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, increased $0.4 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased interest expense incurred. In 2016 and 2015, we capitalized $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of interest expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense and our effective tax rate remained relatively consistent in 2016 and 2015.\nOur future effective tax rate depends on various factors, such as our level of future taxable income, tax legislation and credits and the geographic compositions of our pre-tax income. We do not expect to incur any significant income taxes until such time that we reverse our valuation allowance against our federal and state deferred tax assets upon return to sustained profitability.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests increased $0.2 million, or 205.3% in 2016, as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased net income for a subsidiary, which was driven primarily by changes in the revenue mix to higher margin businesses and decreased operating expenses.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2016 increased as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of the $24.2 million increase in costs and operating expenses, the $0.4 million increase in interest and other expense, net, and the $0.2 million increase in non-controlling interests. Cost increases were partially offset by the $19.7 million increase in revenues. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $40.8 million in 2016, an increase of 37.7% from $29.6 million recorded in 2015. As a percent of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 25.6% in 2016, up from 21.2% of revenue in 2015. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to the $10.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, $3.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, a $0.4 million increase in interest and other expense, net, and a $0.2 million increase in non-controlling interests. The\nincreases were partially offset by the $5.0 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders in 2016 compared to 2015. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders includes $1.4 million expended on our contested proxy election for the annual meeting of stockholders in 2016, which have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, income tax expense, interest and other expense, non-controlling interests, and excludes charges or gains that are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual.

DAS revenue increased $8.2 million, or 21.4%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $6.1 million increase from new build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, which includes a $1.0 million short-term build-out project that included the sale of equipment that was completed during 2015, and a $2.1 million increase in access fees from our telecom operators. The increase in access fees resulted primarily from the new build-out projects that were completed and $0.4 million of one-time fees that were paid for early termination rights.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $15.4 million, or 343.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in subscribers resulting from our build-out of Wi-Fi networks at military bases.\nRetail. Retail revenue decreased $8.6 million, or 21.3%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $6.7 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers in 2015 compared to 2014. The remaining decrease was due to a $1.9 million decrease in retail single-use revenue.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue increased $6.7 million, or 44.1%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $7.4 million increase in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in Wi-Fi build-out revenues related to a project that was completed in 2014.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 6.8%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in advertising sales at our managed and operated locations, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in revenues from other service agreements.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs and operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network access\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>59,411 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development and technology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(140 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs and operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>161,257 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>137,323 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>23,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $3.6 million, or 6.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in depreciation expense and a $3.6 million increase in bandwidth and other direct costs, which is inclusive of a $0.6 million increase in costs directly related to our short-term DAS and Wi-Fi build-out projects. The increases were partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations, which included a one-time $1.9 million cost incurred in 2014 to terminate one of our venue contracts, and a $0.3 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $8.1 million, or 31.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $3.4 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.9 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $1.0 million increase in network maintenance and connectivity expenses, a $0.4 million increase in call center costs, a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, and a $1.1 million increase in other operating expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $4.3 million, or 28.7%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to a $2.1 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.6 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $0.4 million increase in technology service expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in hardware and software maintenance and other operating expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased $3.3 million, or 20.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.2 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, $1.4 million one-time charge for salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for one of our executives who was terminated, and a $0.7 million increase in other marketing related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $4.9 million, or 28.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.7 million increase in personnel related expenses resulting from increased headcount, a $0.8 million increase in depreciation expenses, a $0.5 million increase in business licenses, taxes, and insurance, a $0.5 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $1.4 million increase in rent and other general and administrative expenses.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014. In 2015, we incurred and capitalized $0.6 million of interest expense related to our Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe had income tax expense of $0.5 million in 2015, as compared to $0.7 million in 2014. Our effective tax rate decreased to 2.2% for 2015, as compared to 3.9% in 2014.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests decreased $0.6 million in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of decreased net income for a subsidiary resulting from the transition of the managed and operated venues of this subsidiary from an end-user paid to a tiered pricing model.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the $23.9 million increase in costs and operating expenses, which was partially offset by the $20.3 million increase in revenues, the $0.6 million decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $29.6 million in 2015, an increase of 46.0% from $20.3 million recorded in 2014. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 21.2% in 2015, up from 17.0% of revenue in 2014. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increases were partially offset by the $2.8 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders, the $0.6 million decrease in non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense in 2015, as compared to 2014. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, income tax expense, interest and other expense, non-controlling interests, and excludes charges or gains that are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility. Our primary sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2016 consisted of $19.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $54.8 million available for borrowing under our credit facility, $3.8 million of which is reserved for our outstanding Letter of Credit Authorization agreements.\nOur principal uses of liquidity have been to fund our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions. We expect that these requirements will be our principal needs for liquidity over the near term. Our capital expenditures in 2016 were $107.3 million, of which $76.9 million was reimbursed through revenue for DAS build-out projects from our telecom operators.\nWe have entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and related agreements, as amended with Bank of America, N.A. acting as agent for lenders named therein, including Bank of America, N.A. and Silicon Valley Bank, and Citizens Bank, N.A. (the \"Lenders\"), for a secured credit facility in the form of a revolving line of credit up to $69.8 million, which was increased from $46.5 million in February 2016, with an option to increase the available amount to $86.5 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (the \"Revolving Line of Credit\") and a term loan of $3.5 million (the \"Term Loan\" and together with the Revolving Line of Credit, the \"Credit Facility\"). Both the Term Loan and Revolving Line of Credit mature on November 21, 2018. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit and Term Loan will bear, at our election, a variable interest at LIBOR plus 2.5% - 3.5% or Lender's Prime Rate plus 1.5% - 2.5% per year and we will pay a fee of 0.375% - 0.5% per year on any unused portion of the Revolving Line of Credit. As of December 31, 2016, $2.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan and $15.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit. The Term Loan requires quarterly payments of interest and principal, amortizing fully over the four-year-term such that it is repaid in full on the maturity date of November 21, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest rates for our Credit Facility ranged from 3.0% to 3.6%. Repayment of amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility may be accelerated in the event that we are in violation of the representation, warranties and covenants made in the Credit Agreement, including certain financial covenants set forth therein, and under other specific default events including, but not limited to, non-payment or inability to pay debt, breach of cross default provisions, insolvency provisions, and change in control.\nWe are subject to customary covenants, including a minimum quarterly consolidated leverage ratio, a maximum quarterly consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and monthly liquidity minimums. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of December 31, 2016 and through the date of this report. We are subject to certain non-financial covenants, and we were also in compliance with all such non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2016 and through the date of this report. The Credit Facility provides us with significant additional flexibility and liquidity to pursue our strategic objectives for capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nOn September 11, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf Registration\") on Form S-3 with the SEC that was declared effective by the SEC on September 17, 2015, which permitted us to offer up to $125.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time. In February 2016, we filed a post-effective amendment to terminate the Shelf Registration and remove from registration the securities registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration. The Company's Board of Directors determined that having the Shelf Registration on file was no longer necessary due to the Company increasing the Revolving Line of Credit.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and availability under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our financial statements. There can be no assurance, however, that future industry-specific or other developments, general economic trends, or other matters will not adversely affect our operations or our ability to meet our future cash requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth and corresponding timing of cash collections, the timing and size of our managed and operated location expansion efforts, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. We expect our capital expenditures in 2017 will range from $20.0 million to $25.0 million, excluding capital expenditures for DAS build-out projects, which are reimbursed through revenue from our telecom operator customers. The majority of our 2017 capital expenditures will be used to build out and upgrade Wi-Fi networks at our managed and operated venues and to build out residential broadband and IPTV networks for troops stationed on\nmilitary bases pursuant to our contracts with the U.S. government. The investment of these resources will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them including generation of revenues. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts with us, either at its convenience or for default based on performance. Any such modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We may also enter into acquisitions of complementary businesses, applications or technologies, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nThe following table sets forth cash flow data for the periods indicated therein:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>115,205 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>98,575 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>21,207 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(107,331 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(101,502 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,199 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,121 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>8,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(480 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nIn 2016, we generated $115.2 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $16.6 million from 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $7.4 million change in our operating assets and liabilities, a $10.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to our recent increased fixed assets from our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development, and a $3.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses. The increases were partially offset by the $4.8 million increase in our net loss.\nIn 2015, we generated $98.6 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $77.4 million from 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $68.1 million change in our operating assets and liabilities, a $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, a $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, and a $0.7 million change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. The increases were partially offset by the $3.4 million increase in our net loss and the $0.7 million decrease in impairment losses.\nIn 2014, we generated $21.2 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $0.5 million from 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred revenue in 2014 compared to a $1.9 million decrease in 2013, a $10.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014, a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses in 2014, and a $1.0 million impairment loss in 2014. The increases were partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in our net loss including non-controlling interests from the prior year, a $9.0 million larger increase in accounts receivable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2014 compared to a $1.6 million decrease in 2013, a $2.0 million larger decrease in accounts payable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.1 million decrease in the change in deferred tax assets, and a $0.4 million increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nIn 2016, we used $107.3 million in investing activities, an increase of $5.8 million from 2015. This increase is due to a $4.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment related to our recent increased fixed assets from our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development, and a $1.6 million decrease in cash provided by net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nIn 2015, we used $101.5 million in investing activities, an increase of $62.3 million from 2014. This increase is primarily due to a $32.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and a $29.7 million decrease in cash provided by net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nIn 2014, we used $39.2 million in investing activities, a decrease of $1.2 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $22.8 million increase in cash received from net sales of marketable securities in 2014 compared to 2013, a $19.3 million decrease in cash used in acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013, and a $0.5 million decrease in restricted cash. The decreases were partially offset by a $41.4 million increase in purchases of property and equipment in 2014 compared to 2013.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nIn 2016, we used $3.1 million of cash for financing activities compared to $8.8 million in cash provided by financing activities in 2015. This change is primarily due to a $14.8 million decrease in net proceeds from our Credit Facility, a $1.4 million increase in cash paid for capital leases and notes payable, and a $0.3 million decrease in cash used to pay federal, state, and local employment payroll taxes related to our RSUs that vested during the period. These changes were partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options, $2.8 million of non-recurring payments made in 2015 related to business combinations, and a $0.2 million decrease in payments to our non-controlling interests.\nIn 2015, we received $8.8 million of cash provided by financing activities compared to $0.5 million in cash used in financing activities in 2014. This change is primarily due to the $11.5 million increase in net proceeds from our Credit Facility, a $1.2 million decrease in acquisition related payments, a $0.6 million decrease in deferred financing costs, and a $0.2 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options. These changes were partially offset by $1.6 million of holdback consideration payments made to the previous AWG shareholders, $1.2 million in payments to acquire the remaining non-controlling interests in Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC from the non-controlling interest owners, a $0.6 million increase in cash used to pay federal, state, and local employment payroll taxes related to our RSUs that vested during the period, and $0.9 million in repayments made on our Term Loan during 2015.\nIn 2014, we used $0.5 million in financing activities, a decrease of $10.6 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $10.9 million of cash used to repay notes payable and other financed liabilities that were assumed in our acquisition of Endeka and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market in 2013 that did not recur in 2014, $2.8 million of proceeds received from our Credit Facility, net of deferred financing costs that were paid, and a $0.5 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2014 compared to 2013. The decreases were partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in cash used to pay minimum statutory taxes related to our time-based RSUs that vested during 2014, $1.3 million of cash used to pay continent liabilities and other acquisition related consideration during 2014, and a $0.4 million increase in cash paid for capital leases and notes payable.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due By Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>2 - 3 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>4 - 5 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Venue revenue share minimums(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>35,778 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>7,561 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>11,400 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,234 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases for office space(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,799 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Open purchase commitments(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases for equipment and software(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrecognized tax benefits(6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable(7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>107,295 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>31,146 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>38,283 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>14,484 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>23,382 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Payments under exclusive long-term, non-cancellable contracts to provide wireless communications network access to venues such as airports.

In addition, our Board of Directors determines annually whether any related party relationships exist among the directors which would interfere with the judgment of individual directors in carrying out his responsibilities as director.\nInflation\nInflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years. A significant increase in inflation may affect our future performance since we may not be able to recover the increases in our costs with similar increases in our prices.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with \"Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to our plans, estimates, beliefs and anticipated future financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors,\" \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and elsewhere in this filing.\nOverview\nWe believe we are the leading global provider of neutral-host commercial mobile Wi-Fi Internet solutions and indoor DAS services in the world. Our software applications and solutions enable individuals to access our extensive global Wi-Fi networks that cover more than 1.5 million hotspots. We operate 36 DAS networks containing approximately 19,200 nodes. Our offerings provide compelling cost and performance advantages to our customers and partners.\nWe grew revenue from $139.6 million in 2015 to $159.3 million in 2016, an increase of 14.1%. We grew revenue from $119.3 million in 2014 to $139.6 million in 2015, an increase of 17.0%. We generated a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $27.3 million in 2016 compared to $22.3 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased from $29.6 million in 2015 to $40.8 million in 2016, an increase of 37.7%. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nThe proliferation of smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables, and other Wi-Fi enabled devices-in conjunction with the increased consumption of high-bandwidth activities like video, online gaming, streaming, cloud-based applications and mobile apps-has created a demand for high-speed, high-bandwidth Internet access in public places both large and small. These data intensive activities are driving a global surge in mobile Internet data traffic that is expected to increase nearly seven-fold between 2016 and 2021, according to Cisco's Visual Networking Index. We believe these trends present us with opportunities to generate significant growth in revenue and profitability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, goodwill, measuring recoverability of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we believe the accounting policies discussed below are paramount to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our management's judgments, assumptions and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from several sources including: (i) DAS customers that are telecom operators under long-term contracts for access to our DAS at our managed and operated locations, (ii) military and retail customers under subscription plans for month-to-month network access that automatically renew, and military and retail single-use access from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access plans, (iii) arrangements with wholesale Wi-Fi customers that provide software licensing, network access, and/or professional services fees, and (iv) display advertisements and sponsorships on our walled garden sign-in pages. Software licensed by our wholesale Wi-Fi platform services customers can only be used during the term of the service arrangements and has no utility to them upon termination of the service arrangement.\nWe recognize revenue when an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, fees are fixed or determinable, no significant obligations remain related to the earned fees and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue is presented net of any sales and value added taxes.\nRevenue generated from access to our DAS networks consists of build-out fees and recurring access fees under certain long-term contracts with telecom operators. Build-out fees paid upfront are generally deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the estimated customer relationship period, once the build-out is complete. Periodically, we install and sell Wi-Fi and DAS networks to customers where we do not have service contracts or remaining obligations beyond the installation of those networks and we recognize build-out fees for such projects as revenue when the installation work is completed and the network has been accepted by the customer. Minimum monthly access fees for usage of the DAS networks are non-cancellable and generally escalate on an annual basis. These minimum monthly access fees are recognized ratably over the term of the telecom operator agreement. The initial term of our contracts with telecom operators generally range from five to twenty years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue from DAS network access fees in excess of the monthly minimums is recognized when earned.\nSubscription fees from military and retail customers are paid monthly in advance and revenue is deferred for the portions of monthly recurring subscription fees collected in advance. We provide refunds for our military and retail services on a case-by-case basis. These amounts are not significant and are recorded as contra-revenue in the period the refunds are made. Subscription fee revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue generated from military and retail single-use access is recognized when access is provided.\nServices provided to wholesale Wi-Fi partners generally contain several elements including: (i) a term license to use our software to access our Wi-Fi network, (ii) access fees for Wi-Fi network usage, and/or (iii) professional services for software integration and customization and to maintain the Wi-Fi service. The term license, monthly minimum network access fees and professional services are billed on a monthly basis based upon predetermined fixed rates. Once the term license for integration and customization are delivered, the fees from the arrangement are recognized ratably over the remaining term of the service arrangement. The initial term of the license agreements is generally between one to five years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue for Wi-Fi network access fees in excess of the monthly minimum amounts is recognized when earned. All elements within existing service arrangements are generally delivered and earned concurrently throughout the term of the respective service arrangement.\nIn instances where the minimum monthly Wi-Fi and DAS network access fees escalate over the term of the wholesale service arrangement, an unbilled receivable is recognized when performance is within our control and when we have reasonable assurance that the unbilled receivable balance will be collected.\nWe adopted the provisions of ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (\"ASU 2009-13\"), on a prospective basis on January 1, 2011. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under FASB ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, we defer recognition of revenue for the full arrangement and recognize all revenue ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements, as we did not have evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements in the arrangement. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under ASC 605-25, we evaluate whether or not separate units of accounting exist and then allocate the arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method using estimated selling prices if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. We recognize the revenue associated with the separate units of accounting upon completion of such services or ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements.\nAdvertising revenue is generated from advertisements on our managed and operated or partner networks. In determining whether an arrangement exists, we ensure that a binding arrangement is in place, such as a standard insertion order or a fully executed customer-specific agreement. Obligations pursuant to our advertising revenue arrangements typically include a minimum number of units or the satisfaction of certain performance criteria. Advertising and other revenue is recognized when the services are performed.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying value. We perform our impairment test annually as of December 31st. Entities have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If, after assessing qualitative factors, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If deemed necessary, a two-step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; otherwise, there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired and the amount of the loss, if any, is measured by performing step two. Under step two, the impairment loss, if any, is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we tested our goodwill for impairment using a market based approach and no impairment was identified as the fair value of our sole reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount. To date, we have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges.\nMeasuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets are depreciated and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related asset type using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for property and equipment are as follows:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2 to 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Computer equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2 to 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Furniture, fixtures and office equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3 to 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leasehold improvements\n</td> <td> </td> <td>The shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining term of the agreements, generally ranging from 2 to 18 years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe perform an impairment review of long-lived assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business and/or product strategies and significant industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these indicators, we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate or other indices of fair value. We would then recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation consists of stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), which are granted to employees and non-employees. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value on a straight-line basis, net of forfeitures, over the employee requisite service period. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met. The grant date fair value of our stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided based on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted. The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized.\nWe may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.\nWe establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We evaluate the need for, and the adequacy of, valuation allowances based on the expected realization of our deferred tax assets. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include historical earnings, our latest forecast of taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.\nOur effective tax rates are primarily affected by changes in our valuation allowances, the amount of our taxable income or losses in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, the amount of federal and state net operating losses and tax credits, the extent to which we can utilize these net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits and certain benefits related to stock option activity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 \"Significant Accounting Policies\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to monitoring traditional financial measures, we also monitor our operating performance using key performance indicators. Our key performance indicators follow:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DAS nodes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscribers-military\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscribers-retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Connects\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,413 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDAS nodes. This metric represents the number of active DAS nodes as of the end of the period. A DAS node is a single communications endpoint, typically an antenna, which transmits or receives radio frequency signals wirelessly. This measure is an indicator of the reach of our DAS network. We are experiencing strong customer demand from telecom operators to gain access to our DAS networks; accordingly, we expect to continue to invest in securing, building out and upgrading our DAS networks to meet this demand.\nSubscribers-military and Subscribers-retail. These metrics represent the number of paying customers who are on a month-to-month subscription plan at a given period end. Military subscribers have increased as we deploy our service on new military bases. We also expect to see modest increases in military subscribers as we increase signups for new customers on existing military bases through targeted marketing and by continuing to build the Boingo brand in the military vertical. Retail subscribers have continued to decline as we have expanded our product offerings and enhanced our focus on our wholesale and advertising service offerings.\nConnects. This metric shows how often individuals connect to our global Wi-Fi network in a given period. The connects include wholesale and retail customers in both customer pay locations and customer free locations where we are a paid service provider or receive sponsorship or promotion fees. We count each connect as a single connect regardless of how many times that individual accesses the network at a given venue during their 24 hour period. This measure is an indicator of paid activity throughout our network.\nKey Components of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of DAS revenue, military revenue, retail revenue, wholesale revenue, and advertising and other revenue.\nDAS. We generate revenue from telecom operator partners that pay us network build-out fees, inclusive of network upgrades, and access fees for our DAS and small cell networks.\nMilitary and retail. We generate revenue from sales to military and retail individuals of month-to-month network access subscriptions that automatically renew, primarily through charge card transactions. We also generate revenue from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access to military and retail individuals primarily through charge card transactions.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. We generate revenue from wholesale Wi-Fi partners that license our software and pay usage-based monthly network access fees to allow their customers to access our global Wi-Fi network. Usage-based network access fees may be measured in minutes, connects, megabytes or gigabytes, and in most cases are subject to minimum volume commitments. Other wholesale Wi-Fi partners pay us monthly fees to provide a Wi-Fi infrastructure that we install, manage and operate at their venues for their customers under a service provider arrangement.\nAdvertising and other. We generate revenue from advertisers that seek to reach visitors to our landing pages at our managed and operated network locations with online advertising, promotional and sponsored programs and at locations where we solely provide authorized access to a partner's Wi-Fi network through sponsored access and promotional programs. In addition, we receive revenue from partners in certain venues where we manage and operate the Wi-Fi network.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, entities affiliated with AT&T Inc. accounted for 12%, 17% and 15%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, entities affiliated with Sprint Corporation accounted for 11% of total revenue. The loss of these groups and the customers could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nWe classify our costs and operating expenses as network access, network operations, development and technology, selling and marketing, general and administrative, and amortization of intangible assets. Network access costs consist primarily of payments to venues and network partners in our network. Other costs and operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, costs for contracted labor and development, marketing, legal, accounting and consulting services, and other professional service fees. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. Facilities costs are generally allocated based on headcount. Depreciation and amortization expenses associated with specifically identifiable property and equipment are allocated to the appropriate expense categories.\nNetwork access. Network access costs consist of revenue share payments to venue owners where our managed and operated hotspots are located, usage-based fees to our roaming network partners for access to their networks, depreciation of equipment related to network build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, sale of equipment, and bandwidth and other Internet connectivity expenses in our managed and operated locations.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses consist of costs for our customer service department and for our operations staff who design, build, monitor and maintain our networks. Also included are expenses for our customer service provider that handles customer care inquiries and expenses for network operations contractors, equipment depreciation, and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses consist of costs for our product development and engineering departments, developers and our information systems services staff, depreciation of our equipment and internal-use software, and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist of costs for our business development and marketing employees and executives, travel and entertainment, and marketing programs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of costs for our executive, finance and accounting, legal and human resources personnel, as well as legal, accounting, tax and other professional service fees. Also included are other corporate expenses such as charge card processing fees and bad debt expense.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of acquired venue contracts, technology and non-compete agreements.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, primarily consist of interest income and expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe established a full valuation allowance as a result of our assessment that it was more likely than not that certain federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized and we have continued to maintain the full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests are comprised of minority holdings by third parties in our subsidiaries Chicago Concourse Development Group, LLC (\"CCDG\") and Boingo Holding Participacoes Ltda. (\"BHPL\").\nWe are generally required to pay a portion of allocated net profits less capital expenditures of the preceding year to the non-controlling interest holders of CCDG. The limited liability company agreement for CCDG does not have a term. CCDG can be dissolved upon the unanimous agreement of the members, upon the sale of CCDG, upon declaration of bankruptcy, or upon the termination of the license agreement between CCDG and the City of Chicago.\nWe attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in BHPL under the terms of the limited liability company agreement in proportion to their holdings. The limited liability company agreement with BHPL does not have a term. We, by resolution of the members, may distribute profits against retained earnings or profit reserves existing on the most recent annual balance sheet or may draw up financial statements and distribute profits in shorter periods. BHPL can be dissolved by resolution of the members and as otherwise provided for by law.\nPrior to August 4, 2015, we also had a 70% ownership of Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC (\"CCG Detroit\"). On August 4, 2015, we purchased the remaining 30% ownership interest from the non-controlling interest owners for $1.2 million. We accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of the remaining interest of an entity that had already been majority-owned by the Company. The purchase resulted in a reduction to additional paid-in capital of $1.2 million representing excess purchase price over the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests. In prior years, we attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in CCG Detroit under the terms of the limited liability company agreement. CCG Detroit had generated losses, which had reduced the non-controlling owners capital account to zero in 2009, resulting in an allocation to the controlling interest holder of all operating losses and deficits created by fixed distributions to the non-controlling interest holder. The fixed distributions were terminated during September 2013 concurrent with the termination of CCG Detroit's agreement with Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.\nResults of Operations\nThe

39.5%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense from our increased fixed assets for our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development in those periods.\nStock-based compensation expense\nStock-based compensation expense increased $3.4 million, or 36.3%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in 2015 and 2016.\nFurther, in 2016, our Compensation Committee determined to adjust its practice of making annual long-term equity grants and instead adopted a compensation cycle whereby it granted equity awards to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer covering the number of shares it might otherwise have granted in 2016 through 2018, with \"cliff\" vesting dates in 2019. These grants were made to focus our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer on the Company's overall long-term corporate and strategic goals, eliminate intervening quarterly vesting dates that force them to sell shares in the market to cover taxes triggered upon vesting, and strengthen the Company's ability to retain our senior management team over the next three years. As a result of these larger-than-usual RSU grants, the Compensation Committee does not intend to grant additional equity awards to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer until 2019.\nStock-based compensation expense increased $2.2 million, or 31.2%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in those periods as well as $1.0 million of additional stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2015 resulting from a change in the expected service period for one of our executives, who was terminated. Under the terms of the executive's employment agreement, the executive received 12 months of accelerated vesting credit on unvested stock-based awards.\nWe have shifted our stock-based compensation from stock options to RSUs, which generally vest over a specified service period. We also issue performance-based RSUs to executive personnel. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met.\nAt December 31, 2016, the total remaining stock-based compensation expense for unvested stock option awards is approximately $323,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.8 years. At December 31, 2016, the total remaining stock-based compensation expense for unvested RSU awards is approximately $17,831,000 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the specified periods as a percentage of our revenue for those periods.\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

DAS build-out revenues in 2016 and 2015 include $0.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of short-term build projects that include sales\nof equipment that were completed during those periods. DAS access fees for 2015 include $0.4 million of one-time fees that were paid for early termination rights.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $20.1 million, or 100.9%, in 2016, as compared to 2015 due to a $16.9 million increase in military subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the increase in military subscribers and a 5.5% increase in the average monthly revenue per military subscriber in 2016 compared to 2015, and a $3.2 million increase in military single-use revenue.\nRetail. Retail revenue decreased $5.1 million, or 16.1%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to a $4.0 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers and a 1.5% decrease in the average monthly revenue per retail subscriber, and a $1.1 million decrease in retail single-use revenue.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue increased $0.3 million, or 1.4%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in wholesale service provider revenue.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue decreased $7.3 million, or 37.1%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $7.9 million decrease in advertising sales at our managed and operated locations resulting from a decline in the number of premium ad units sold.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs and operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network access\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>69,112 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development and technology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(924 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(128 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs and operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>185,441 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>161,257 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>24,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $6.1 million, or 9.7%, in 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $4.3 million increase in depreciation expense related to our increased fixed assets from our DAS build-out projects, a $2.3 million increase in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations and a $0.9 million increase in bandwidth and other direct costs. The increases were partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues and a $0.7 million decrease in other cost of revenue. Other costs of revenue in 2016 and 2015 included $0.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of costs directly related to our short-term DAS projects that were completed during those periods.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $8.8 million, or 26.2%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $4.9 million increase in depreciation expense related to our increased fixed assets, a $2.3 million increase in personnel related expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, a $1.0 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $3.0 million, or 15.6%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in depreciation expense\nrelated to our increased fixed assets, a $0.7 million increase in cloud computing, hardware and software maintenance expenses, and a $0.4 million increase in consulting expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 4.7%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to a $1.4 million decrease in personnel related expenses which was primarily due to a management reorganization that included the elimination of the position of President in January 2016. The decrease was partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in consulting expenses and a $0.2 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $7.4 million, or 32.9%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $5.4 million increase in personnel related expenses, which is inclusive of a $4.0 million increase in stock-based compensation, resulting from increased headcount and the change in the structure and grant cycle of the RSUs granted to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in 2016, $1.4 million expended on our contested proxy election for the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, and a $0.6 million increase in professional fees.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense remained relatively consistent in 2016, as compared to 2015.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, increased $0.4 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased interest expense incurred. In 2016 and 2015, we capitalized $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of interest expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense and our effective tax rate remained relatively consistent in 2016 and 2015.\nOur future effective tax rate depends on various factors, such as our level of future taxable income, tax legislation and credits and the geographic compositions of our pre-tax income. We do not expect to incur any significant income taxes until such time that we reverse our valuation allowance against our federal and state deferred tax assets upon return to sustained profitability.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests increased $0.2 million, or 205.3% in 2016, as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased net income for a subsidiary, which was driven primarily by changes in the revenue mix to higher margin businesses and decreased operating expenses.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2016 increased as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of the $24.2 million increase in costs and operating expenses, the $0.4 million increase in interest and other expense, net, and the $0.2 million increase in non-controlling interests. Cost increases were partially offset by the $19.7 million increase in revenues. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $40.8 million in 2016, an increase of 37.7% from $29.6 million recorded in 2015. As a percent of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 25.6% in 2016, up from 21.2% of revenue in 2015. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to the $10.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, $3.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, a $0.4 million increase in interest and other expense, net, and a $0.2 million increase in non-controlling interests. The\nincreases were partially offset by the $5.0 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders in 2016 compared to 2015. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders includes $1.4 million expended on our contested proxy election for the annual meeting of stockholders in 2016, which have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, income tax expense, interest and other expense, non-controlling interests, and excludes charges or gains that are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual.

DAS revenue increased $8.2 million, or 21.4%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $6.1 million increase from new build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, which includes a $1.0 million short-term build-out project that included the sale of equipment that was completed during 2015, and a $2.1 million increase in access fees from our telecom operators. The increase in access fees resulted primarily from the new build-out projects that were completed and $0.4 million of one-time fees that were paid for early termination rights.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $15.4 million, or 343.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in subscribers resulting from our build-out of Wi-Fi networks at military bases.\nRetail. Retail revenue decreased $8.6 million, or 21.3%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $6.7 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers in 2015 compared to 2014. The remaining decrease was due to a $1.9 million decrease in retail single-use revenue.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue increased $6.7 million, or 44.1%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $7.4 million increase in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in Wi-Fi build-out revenues related to a project that was completed in 2014.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 6.8%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in advertising sales at our managed and operated locations, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in revenues from other service agreements.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs and operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network access\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>59,411 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development and technology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(140 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs and operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>161,257 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>137,323 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>23,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $3.6 million, or 6.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in depreciation expense and a $3.6 million increase in bandwidth and other direct costs, which is inclusive of a $0.6 million increase in costs directly related to our short-term DAS and Wi-Fi build-out projects. The increases were partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations, which included a one-time $1.9 million cost incurred in 2014 to terminate one of our venue contracts, and a $0.3 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $8.1 million, or 31.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $3.4 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.9 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $1.0 million increase in network maintenance and connectivity expenses, a $0.4 million increase in call center costs, a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, and a $1.1 million increase in other operating expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $4.3 million, or 28.7%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to a $2.1 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.6 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $0.4 million increase in technology service expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in hardware and software maintenance and other operating expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased $3.3 million, or 20.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.2 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, $1.4 million one-time charge for salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for one of our executives who was terminated, and a $0.7 million increase in other marketing related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $4.9 million, or 28.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.7 million increase in personnel related expenses resulting from increased headcount, a $0.8 million increase in depreciation expenses, a $0.5 million increase in business licenses, taxes, and insurance, a $0.5 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $1.4 million increase in rent and other general and administrative expenses.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014. In 2015, we incurred and capitalized $0.6 million of interest expense related to our Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe had income tax expense of $0.5 million in 2015, as compared to $0.7 million in 2014. Our effective tax rate decreased to 2.2% for 2015, as compared to 3.9% in 2014.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests decreased $0.6 million in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of decreased net income for a subsidiary resulting from the transition of the managed and operated venues of this subsidiary from an end-user paid to a tiered pricing model.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the $23.9 million increase in costs and operating expenses, which was partially offset by the $20.3 million increase in revenues, the $0.6 million decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $29.6 million in 2015, an increase of 46.0% from $20.3 million recorded in 2014. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 21.2% in 2015, up from 17.0% of revenue in 2014. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increases were partially offset by the $2.8 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders, the $0.6 million decrease in non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense in 2015, as compared to 2014. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, income tax expense, interest and other expense, non-controlling interests, and excludes charges or gains that are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility. Our primary sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2016 consisted of $19.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $54.8 million available for borrowing under our credit facility, $3.8 million of which is reserved for our outstanding Letter of Credit Authorization agreements.\nOur principal uses of liquidity have been to fund our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions. We expect that these requirements will be our principal needs for liquidity over the near term. Our capital expenditures in 2016 were $107.3 million, of which $76.9 million was reimbursed through revenue for DAS build-out projects from our telecom operators.\nWe have entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and related agreements, as amended with Bank of America, N.A. acting as agent for lenders named therein, including Bank of America, N.A. and Silicon Valley Bank, and Citizens Bank, N.A. (the \"Lenders\"), for a secured credit facility in the form of a revolving line of credit up to $69.8 million, which was increased from $46.5 million in February 2016, with an option to increase the available amount to $86.5 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (the \"Revolving Line of Credit\") and a term loan of $3.5 million (the \"Term Loan\" and together with the Revolving Line of Credit, the \"Credit Facility\"). Both the Term Loan and Revolving Line of Credit mature on November 21, 2018. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit and Term Loan will bear, at our election, a variable interest at LIBOR plus 2.5% - 3.5% or Lender's Prime Rate plus 1.5% - 2.5% per year and we will pay a fee of 0.375% - 0.5% per year on any unused portion of the Revolving Line of Credit. As of December 31, 2016, $2.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan and $15.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit. The Term Loan requires quarterly payments of interest and principal, amortizing fully over the four-year-term such that it is repaid in full on the maturity date of November 21, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest rates for our Credit Facility ranged from 3.0% to 3.6%. Repayment of amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility may be accelerated in the event that we are in violation of the representation, warranties and covenants made in the Credit Agreement, including certain financial covenants set forth therein, and under other specific default events including, but not limited to, non-payment or inability to pay debt, breach of cross default provisions, insolvency provisions, and change in control.\nWe are subject to customary covenants, including a minimum quarterly consolidated leverage ratio, a maximum quarterly consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and monthly liquidity minimums. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of December 31, 2016 and through the date of this report. We are subject to certain non-financial covenants, and we were also in compliance with all such non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2016 and through the date of this report. The Credit Facility provides us with significant additional flexibility and liquidity to pursue our strategic objectives for capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nOn September 11, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf Registration\") on Form S-3 with the SEC that was declared effective by the SEC on September 17, 2015, which permitted us to offer up to $125.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time. In February 2016, we filed a post-effective amendment to terminate the Shelf Registration and remove from registration the securities registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration. The Company's Board of Directors determined that having the Shelf Registration on file was no longer necessary due to the Company increasing the Revolving Line of Credit.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and availability under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our financial statements. There can be no assurance, however, that future industry-specific or other developments, general economic trends, or other matters will not adversely affect our operations or our ability to meet our future cash requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth and corresponding timing of cash collections, the timing and size of our managed and operated location expansion efforts, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. We expect our capital expenditures in 2017 will range from $20.0 million to $25.0 million, excluding capital expenditures for DAS build-out projects, which are reimbursed through revenue from our telecom operator customers. The majority of our 2017 capital expenditures will be used to build out and upgrade Wi-Fi networks at our managed and operated venues and to build out residential broadband and IPTV networks for troops stationed on\nmilitary bases pursuant to our contracts with the U.S. government. The investment of these resources will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them including generation of revenues. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts with us, either at its convenience or for default based on performance. Any such modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We may also enter into acquisitions of complementary businesses, applications or technologies, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nThe following table sets forth cash flow data for the periods indicated therein:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>115,205 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>98,575 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>21,207 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(107,331 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(101,502 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,199 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,121 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>8,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(480 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nIn 2016, we generated $115.2 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $16.6 million from 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $7.4 million change in our operating assets and liabilities, a $10.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to our recent increased fixed assets from our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development, and a $3.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses. The increases were partially offset by the $4.8 million increase in our net loss.\nIn 2015, we generated $98.6 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $77.4 million from 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $68.1 million change in our operating assets and liabilities, a $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, a $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, and a $0.7 million change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. The increases were partially offset by the $3.4 million increase in our net loss and the $0.7 million decrease in impairment losses.\nIn 2014, we generated $21.2 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $0.5 million from 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred revenue in 2014 compared to a $1.9 million decrease in 2013, a $10.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014, a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses in 2014, and a $1.0 million impairment loss in 2014. The increases were partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in our net loss including non-controlling interests from the prior year, a $9.0 million larger increase in accounts receivable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2014 compared to a $1.6 million decrease in 2013, a $2.0 million larger decrease in accounts payable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.1 million decrease in the change in deferred tax assets, and a $0.4 million increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nIn 2016, we used $107.3 million in investing activities, an increase of $5.8 million from 2015. This increase is due to a $4.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment related to our recent increased fixed assets from our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development, and a $1.6 million decrease in cash provided by net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nIn 2015, we used $101.5 million in investing activities, an increase of $62.3 million from 2014. This increase is primarily due to a $32.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and a $29.7 million decrease in cash provided by net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nIn 2014, we used $39.2 million in investing activities, a decrease of $1.2 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $22.8 million increase in cash received from net sales of marketable securities in 2014 compared to 2013, a $19.3 million decrease in cash used in acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013, and a $0.5 million decrease in restricted cash. The decreases were partially offset by a $41.4 million increase in purchases of property and equipment in 2014 compared to 2013.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nIn 2016, we used $3.1 million of cash for financing activities compared to $8.8 million in cash provided by financing activities in 2015. This change is primarily due to a $14.8 million decrease in net proceeds from our Credit Facility, a $1.4 million increase in cash paid for capital leases and notes payable, and a $0.3 million decrease in cash used to pay federal, state, and local employment payroll taxes related to our RSUs that vested during the period. These changes were partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options, $2.8 million of non-recurring payments made in 2015 related to business combinations, and a $0.2 million decrease in payments to our non-controlling interests.\nIn 2015, we received $8.8 million of cash provided by financing activities compared to $0.5 million in cash used in financing activities in 2014. This change is primarily due to the $11.5 million increase in net proceeds from our Credit Facility, a $1.2 million decrease in acquisition related payments, a $0.6 million decrease in deferred financing costs, and a $0.2 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options. These changes were partially offset by $1.6 million of holdback consideration payments made to the previous AWG shareholders, $1.2 million in payments to acquire the remaining non-controlling interests in Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC from the non-controlling interest owners, a $0.6 million increase in cash used to pay federal, state, and local employment payroll taxes related to our RSUs that vested during the period, and $0.9 million in repayments made on our Term Loan during 2015.\nIn 2014, we used $0.5 million in financing activities, a decrease of $10.6 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $10.9 million of cash used to repay notes payable and other financed liabilities that were assumed in our acquisition of Endeka and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market in 2013 that did not recur in 2014, $2.8 million of proceeds received from our Credit Facility, net of deferred financing costs that were paid, and a $0.5 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2014 compared to 2013. The decreases were partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in cash used to pay minimum statutory taxes related to our time-based RSUs that vested during 2014, $1.3 million of cash used to pay continent liabilities and other acquisition related consideration during 2014, and a $0.4 million increase in cash paid for capital leases and notes payable.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due By Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>2 - 3 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>4 - 5 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Venue revenue share minimums(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>35,778 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>7,561 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>11,400 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,234 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases for office space(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,799 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Open purchase commitments(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases for equipment and software(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrecognized tax benefits(6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable(7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>107,295 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>31,146 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>38,283 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>14,484 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>23,382 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Payments under exclusive long-term, non-cancellable contracts to provide wireless communications network access to venues such as airports.

In addition, our Board of Directors determines annually whether any related party relationships exist among the directors which would interfere with the judgment of individual directors in carrying out his responsibilities as director.\nInflation\nInflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years. A significant increase in inflation may affect our future performance since we may not be able to recover the increases in our costs with similar increases in our prices.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with \"Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to our plans, estimates, beliefs and anticipated future financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors,\" \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and elsewhere in this filing.\nOverview\nWe believe we are the leading global provider of neutral-host commercial mobile Wi-Fi Internet solutions and indoor DAS services in the world. Our software applications and solutions enable individuals to access our extensive global Wi-Fi networks that cover more than 1.5 million hotspots. We operate 36 DAS networks containing approximately 19,200 nodes. Our offerings provide compelling cost and performance advantages to our customers and partners.\nWe grew revenue from $139.6 million in 2015 to $159.3 million in 2016, an increase of 14.1%. We grew revenue from $119.3 million in 2014 to $139.6 million in 2015, an increase of 17.0%. We generated a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $27.3 million in 2016 compared to $22.3 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased from $29.6 million in 2015 to $40.8 million in 2016, an increase of 37.7%. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nThe proliferation of smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables, and other Wi-Fi enabled devices-in conjunction with the increased consumption of high-bandwidth activities like video, online gaming, streaming, cloud-based applications and mobile apps-has created a demand for high-speed, high-bandwidth Internet access in public places both large and small. These data intensive activities are driving a global surge in mobile Internet data traffic that is expected to increase nearly seven-fold between 2016 and 2021, according to Cisco's Visual Networking Index. We believe these trends present us with opportunities to generate significant growth in revenue and profitability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, goodwill, measuring recoverability of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we believe the accounting policies discussed below are paramount to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our management's judgments, assumptions and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from several sources including: (i) DAS customers that are telecom operators under long-term contracts for access to our DAS at our managed and operated locations, (ii) military and retail customers under subscription plans for month-to-month network access that automatically renew, and military and retail single-use access from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access plans, (iii) arrangements with wholesale Wi-Fi customers that provide software licensing, network access, and/or professional services fees, and (iv) display advertisements and sponsorships on our walled garden sign-in pages. Software licensed by our wholesale Wi-Fi platform services customers can only be used during the term of the service arrangements and has no utility to them upon termination of the service arrangement.\nWe recognize revenue when an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, fees are fixed or determinable, no significant obligations remain related to the earned fees and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue is presented net of any sales and value added taxes.\nRevenue generated from access to our DAS networks consists of build-out fees and recurring access fees under certain long-term contracts with telecom operators. Build-out fees paid upfront are generally deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the estimated customer relationship period, once the build-out is complete. Periodically, we install and sell Wi-Fi and DAS networks to customers where we do not have service contracts or remaining obligations beyond the installation of those networks and we recognize build-out fees for such projects as revenue when the installation work is completed and the network has been accepted by the customer. Minimum monthly access fees for usage of the DAS networks are non-cancellable and generally escalate on an annual basis. These minimum monthly access fees are recognized ratably over the term of the telecom operator agreement. The initial term of our contracts with telecom operators generally range from five to twenty years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue from DAS network access fees in excess of the monthly minimums is recognized when earned.\nSubscription fees from military and retail customers are paid monthly in advance and revenue is deferred for the portions of monthly recurring subscription fees collected in advance. We provide refunds for our military and retail services on a case-by-case basis. These amounts are not significant and are recorded as contra-revenue in the period the refunds are made. Subscription fee revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue generated from military and retail single-use access is recognized when access is provided.\nServices provided to wholesale Wi-Fi partners generally contain several elements including: (i) a term license to use our software to access our Wi-Fi network, (ii) access fees for Wi-Fi network usage, and/or (iii) professional services for software integration and customization and to maintain the Wi-Fi service. The term license, monthly minimum network access fees and professional services are billed on a monthly basis based upon predetermined fixed rates. Once the term license for integration and customization are delivered, the fees from the arrangement are recognized ratably over the remaining term of the service arrangement. The initial term of the license agreements is generally between one to five years and the agreements generally contain renewal clauses. Revenue for Wi-Fi network access fees in excess of the monthly minimum amounts is recognized when earned. All elements within existing service arrangements are generally delivered and earned concurrently throughout the term of the respective service arrangement.\nIn instances where the minimum monthly Wi-Fi and DAS network access fees escalate over the term of the wholesale service arrangement, an unbilled receivable is recognized when performance is within our control and when we have reasonable assurance that the unbilled receivable balance will be collected.\nWe adopted the provisions of ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (\"ASU 2009-13\"), on a prospective basis on January 1, 2011. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under FASB ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, we defer recognition of revenue for the full arrangement and recognize all revenue ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements, as we did not have evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements in the arrangement. For multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011 that are accounted for under ASC 605-25, we evaluate whether or not separate units of accounting exist and then allocate the arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method using estimated selling prices if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. We recognize the revenue associated with the separate units of accounting upon completion of such services or ratably over the wholesale service period for Wi-Fi platform service arrangements and the term of the estimated customer relationship period for DAS arrangements.\nAdvertising revenue is generated from advertisements on our managed and operated or partner networks. In determining whether an arrangement exists, we ensure that a binding arrangement is in place, such as a standard insertion order or a fully executed customer-specific agreement. Obligations pursuant to our advertising revenue arrangements typically include a minimum number of units or the satisfaction of certain performance criteria. Advertising and other revenue is recognized when the services are performed.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying value. We perform our impairment test annually as of December 31st. Entities have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If, after assessing qualitative factors, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If deemed necessary, a two-step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; otherwise, there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired and the amount of the loss, if any, is measured by performing step two. Under step two, the impairment loss, if any, is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we tested our goodwill for impairment using a market based approach and no impairment was identified as the fair value of our sole reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount. To date, we have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges.\nMeasuring Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets are depreciated and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related asset type using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for property and equipment are as follows:\n\nWe perform an impairment review of long-lived assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business and/or product strategies and significant industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these indicators, we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate or other indices of fair value. We would then recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation consists of stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), which are granted to employees and non-employees. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value on a straight-line basis, net of forfeitures, over the employee requisite service period. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met. The grant date fair value of our stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided based on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted. The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized.\nWe may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.\nWe establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We evaluate the need for, and the adequacy of, valuation allowances based on the expected realization of our deferred tax assets. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include historical earnings, our latest forecast of taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.\nOur effective tax rates are primarily affected by changes in our valuation allowances, the amount of our taxable income or losses in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, the amount of federal and state net operating losses and tax credits, the extent to which we can utilize these net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits and certain benefits related to stock option activity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 \"Significant Accounting Policies\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to monitoring traditional financial measures, we also monitor our operating performance using key performance indicators. Our key performance indicators follow:\n\nDAS nodes. This metric represents the number of active DAS nodes as of the end of the period. A DAS node is a single communications endpoint, typically an antenna, which transmits or receives radio frequency signals wirelessly. This measure is an indicator of the reach of our DAS network. We are experiencing strong customer demand from telecom operators to gain access to our DAS networks; accordingly, we expect to continue to invest in securing, building out and upgrading our DAS networks to meet this demand.\nSubscribers-military and Subscribers-retail. These metrics represent the number of paying customers who are on a month-to-month subscription plan at a given period end. Military subscribers have increased as we deploy our service on new military bases. We also expect to see modest increases in military subscribers as we increase signups for new customers on existing military bases through targeted marketing and by continuing to build the Boingo brand in the military vertical. Retail subscribers have continued to decline as we have expanded our product offerings and enhanced our focus on our wholesale and advertising service offerings.\nConnects. This metric shows how often individuals connect to our global Wi-Fi network in a given period. The connects include wholesale and retail customers in both customer pay locations and customer free locations where we are a paid service provider or receive sponsorship or promotion fees. We count each connect as a single connect regardless of how many times that individual accesses the network at a given venue during their 24 hour period. This measure is an indicator of paid activity throughout our network.\nKey Components of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists of DAS revenue, military revenue, retail revenue, wholesale revenue, and advertising and other revenue.\nDAS. We generate revenue from telecom operator partners that pay us network build-out fees, inclusive of network upgrades, and access fees for our DAS and small cell networks.\nMilitary and retail. We generate revenue from sales to military and retail individuals of month-to-month network access subscriptions that automatically renew, primarily through charge card transactions. We also generate revenue from sales of hourly, daily or other single-use access to military and retail individuals primarily through charge card transactions.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. We generate revenue from wholesale Wi-Fi partners that license our software and pay usage-based monthly network access fees to allow their customers to access our global Wi-Fi network. Usage-based network access fees may be measured in minutes, connects, megabytes or gigabytes, and in most cases are subject to minimum volume commitments. Other wholesale Wi-Fi partners pay us monthly fees to provide a Wi-Fi infrastructure that we install, manage and operate at their venues for their customers under a service provider arrangement.\nAdvertising and other. We generate revenue from advertisers that seek to reach visitors to our landing pages at our managed and operated network locations with online advertising, promotional and sponsored programs and at locations where we solely provide authorized access to a partner's Wi-Fi network through sponsored access and promotional programs. In addition, we receive revenue from partners in certain venues where we manage and operate the Wi-Fi network.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, entities affiliated with AT&T Inc. accounted for 12%, 17% and 15%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, entities affiliated with Sprint Corporation accounted for 11% of total revenue. The loss of these groups and the customers could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nWe classify our costs and operating expenses as network access, network operations, development and technology, selling and marketing, general and administrative, and amortization of intangible assets. Network access costs consist primarily of payments to venues and network partners in our network. Other costs and operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, costs for contracted labor and development, marketing, legal, accounting and consulting services, and other professional service fees. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. Facilities costs are generally allocated based on headcount. Depreciation and amortization expenses associated with specifically identifiable property and equipment are allocated to the appropriate expense categories.\nNetwork access. Network access costs consist of revenue share payments to venue owners where our managed and operated hotspots are located, usage-based fees to our roaming network partners for access to their networks, depreciation of equipment related to network build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, sale of equipment, and bandwidth and other Internet connectivity expenses in our managed and operated locations.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses consist of costs for our customer service department and for our operations staff who design, build, monitor and maintain our networks. Also included are expenses for our customer service provider that handles customer care inquiries and expenses for network operations contractors, equipment depreciation, and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses consist of costs for our product development and engineering departments, developers and our information systems services staff, depreciation of our equipment and internal-use software, and software and hardware maintenance fees.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consist of costs for our business development and marketing employees and executives, travel and entertainment, and marketing programs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of costs for our executive, finance and accounting, legal and human resources personnel, as well as legal, accounting, tax and other professional service fees. Also included are other corporate expenses such as charge card processing fees and bad debt expense.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of acquired venue contracts, technology and non-compete agreements.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, primarily consist of interest income and expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe established a full valuation allowance as a result of our assessment that it was more likely than not that certain federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized and we have continued to maintain the full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests are comprised of minority holdings by third parties in our subsidiaries Chicago Concourse Development Group, LLC (\"CCDG\") and Boingo Holding Participacoes Ltda. (\"BHPL\").\nWe are generally required to pay a portion of allocated net profits less capital expenditures of the preceding year to the non-controlling interest holders of CCDG. The limited liability company agreement for CCDG does not have a term. CCDG can be dissolved upon the unanimous agreement of the members, upon the sale of CCDG, upon declaration of bankruptcy, or upon the termination of the license agreement between CCDG and the City of Chicago.\nWe attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in BHPL under the terms of the limited liability company agreement in proportion to their holdings. The limited liability company agreement with BHPL does not have a term. We, by resolution of the members, may distribute profits against retained earnings or profit reserves existing on the most recent annual balance sheet or may draw up financial statements and distribute profits in shorter periods. BHPL can be dissolved by resolution of the members and as otherwise provided for by law.\nPrior to August 4, 2015, we also had a 70% ownership of Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC (\"CCG Detroit\"). On August 4, 2015, we purchased the remaining 30% ownership interest from the non-controlling interest owners for $1.2 million. We accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of the remaining interest of an entity that had already been majority-owned by the Company. The purchase resulted in a reduction to additional paid-in capital of $1.2 million representing excess purchase price over the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests. In prior years, we attributed profits and losses to the non-controlling interest in CCG Detroit under the terms of the limited liability company agreement. CCG Detroit had generated losses, which had reduced the non-controlling owners capital account to zero in 2009, resulting in an allocation to the controlling interest holder of all operating losses and deficits created by fixed distributions to the non-controlling interest holder. The fixed distributions were terminated during September 2013 concurrent with the termination of CCG Detroit's agreement with Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the specified periods.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation expense increased $10.9 million, or 28.5%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, and depreciation expense increased $10.8 million, or 39.5%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense from our increased fixed assets for our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development in those periods.\nStock-based compensation expense\nStock-based compensation expense increased $3.4 million, or 36.3%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in 2015 and 2016.\nFurther, in 2016, our Compensation Committee determined to adjust its practice of making annual long-term equity grants and instead adopted a compensation cycle whereby it granted equity awards to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer covering the number of shares it might otherwise have granted in 2016 through 2018, with \"cliff\" vesting dates in 2019. These grants were made to focus our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer on the Company's overall long-term corporate and strategic goals, eliminate intervening quarterly vesting dates that force them to sell shares in the market to cover taxes triggered upon vesting, and strengthen the Company's ability to retain our senior management team over the next three years. As a result of these larger-than-usual RSU grants, the Compensation Committee does not intend to grant additional equity awards to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer until 2019.\nStock-based compensation expense increased $2.2 million, or 31.2%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to additional stock-based compensation expenses for RSUs granted in those periods as well as $1.0 million of additional stock-based compensation expense recognized in 2015 resulting from a change in the expected service period for one of our executives, who was terminated. Under the terms of the executive's employment agreement, the executive received 12 months of accelerated vesting credit on unvested stock-based awards.\nWe have shifted our stock-based compensation from stock options to RSUs, which generally vest over a specified service period. We also issue performance-based RSUs to executive personnel. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs when we believe that it is probable that the performance objectives will be met.\nAt December 31, 2016, the total remaining stock-based compensation expense for unvested stock option awards is approximately $323,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.8 years. At December 31, 2016, the total remaining stock-based compensation expense for unvested RSU awards is approximately $17,831,000 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the specified periods as a percentage of our revenue for those periods.\n\nYears ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue\n\nDAS. DAS revenue increased $11.7 million, or 25.2%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to an $8.9 million increase from new build-out projects in our managed and operated locations and a $2.8 million increase in access fees from our telecom operators. DAS build-out revenues in 2016 and 2015 include $0.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of short-term build projects that include sales\nof equipment that were completed during those periods. DAS access fees for 2015 include $0.4 million of one-time fees that were paid for early termination rights.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $20.1 million, or 100.9%, in 2016, as compared to 2015 due to a $16.9 million increase in military subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the increase in military subscribers and a 5.5% increase in the average monthly revenue per military subscriber in 2016 compared to 2015, and a $3.2 million increase in military single-use revenue.\nRetail. Retail revenue decreased $5.1 million, or 16.1%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to a $4.0 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers and a 1.5% decrease in the average monthly revenue per retail subscriber, and a $1.1 million decrease in retail single-use revenue.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue increased $0.3 million, or 1.4%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in wholesale service provider revenue.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue decreased $7.3 million, or 37.1%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $7.9 million decrease in advertising sales at our managed and operated locations resulting from a decline in the number of premium ad units sold.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\n\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $6.1 million, or 9.7%, in 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $4.3 million increase in depreciation expense related to our increased fixed assets from our DAS build-out projects, a $2.3 million increase in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations and a $0.9 million increase in bandwidth and other direct costs. The increases were partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues and a $0.7 million decrease in other cost of revenue. Other costs of revenue in 2016 and 2015 included $0.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of costs directly related to our short-term DAS projects that were completed during those periods.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $8.8 million, or 26.2%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $4.9 million increase in depreciation expense related to our increased fixed assets, a $2.3 million increase in personnel related expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, a $1.0 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $3.0 million, or 15.6%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in depreciation expense\nrelated to our increased fixed assets, a $0.7 million increase in cloud computing, hardware and software maintenance expenses, and a $0.4 million increase in consulting expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 4.7%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, due to a $1.4 million decrease in personnel related expenses which was primarily due to a management reorganization that included the elimination of the position of President in January 2016. The decrease was partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in consulting expenses and a $0.2 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $7.4 million, or 32.9%, in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to a $5.4 million increase in personnel related expenses, which is inclusive of a $4.0 million increase in stock-based compensation, resulting from increased headcount and the change in the structure and grant cycle of the RSUs granted to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in 2016, $1.4 million expended on our contested proxy election for the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, and a $0.6 million increase in professional fees.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense remained relatively consistent in 2016, as compared to 2015.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, increased $0.4 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased interest expense incurred. In 2016 and 2015, we capitalized $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of interest expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense and our effective tax rate remained relatively consistent in 2016 and 2015.\nOur future effective tax rate depends on various factors, such as our level of future taxable income, tax legislation and credits and the geographic compositions of our pre-tax income. We do not expect to incur any significant income taxes until such time that we reverse our valuation allowance against our federal and state deferred tax assets upon return to sustained profitability.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests increased $0.2 million, or 205.3% in 2016, as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased net income for a subsidiary, which was driven primarily by changes in the revenue mix to higher margin businesses and decreased operating expenses.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2016 increased as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of the $24.2 million increase in costs and operating expenses, the $0.4 million increase in interest and other expense, net, and the $0.2 million increase in non-controlling interests. Cost increases were partially offset by the $19.7 million increase in revenues. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $40.8 million in 2016, an increase of 37.7% from $29.6 million recorded in 2015. As a percent of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 25.6% in 2016, up from 21.2% of revenue in 2015. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to the $10.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, $3.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, a $0.4 million increase in interest and other expense, net, and a $0.2 million increase in non-controlling interests. The\nincreases were partially offset by the $5.0 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders in 2016 compared to 2015. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders includes $1.4 million expended on our contested proxy election for the annual meeting of stockholders in 2016, which have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, income tax expense, interest and other expense, non-controlling interests, and excludes charges or gains that are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nYears ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\n\nDAS. DAS revenue increased $8.2 million, or 21.4%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $6.1 million increase from new build-out projects in our managed and operated locations, which includes a $1.0 million short-term build-out project that included the sale of equipment that was completed during 2015, and a $2.1 million increase in access fees from our telecom operators. The increase in access fees resulted primarily from the new build-out projects that were completed and $0.4 million of one-time fees that were paid for early termination rights.\nMilitary. Military revenue increased $15.4 million, or 343.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in subscribers resulting from our build-out of Wi-Fi networks at military bases.\nRetail. Retail revenue decreased $8.6 million, or 21.3%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $6.7 million decrease in retail subscriber revenue, which was driven primarily by the decrease in retail subscribers in 2015 compared to 2014. The remaining decrease was due to a $1.9 million decrease in retail single-use revenue.\nWholesale-Wi-Fi. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue increased $6.7 million, or 44.1%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $7.4 million increase in partner usage based fees, which was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in Wi-Fi build-out revenues related to a project that was completed in 2014.\nAdvertising and other. Advertising and other revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 6.8%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in advertising sales at our managed and operated locations, which was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in revenues from other service agreements.\nCosts and Operating Expenses\n\nNetwork access. Network access costs increased $3.6 million, or 6.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in depreciation expense and a $3.6 million increase in bandwidth and other direct costs, which is inclusive of a $0.6 million increase in costs directly related to our short-term DAS and Wi-Fi build-out projects. The increases were partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in revenue share paid to venues in our managed and operated locations, which included a one-time $1.9 million cost incurred in 2014 to terminate one of our venue contracts, and a $0.3 million decrease from customer usage at partner venues.\nNetwork operations. Network operations expenses increased $8.1 million, or 31.6%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $3.4 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.9 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $1.0 million increase in network maintenance and connectivity expenses, a $0.4 million increase in call center costs, a $0.3 million increase in hardware and software maintenance expenses, and a $1.1 million increase in other operating expenses.\nDevelopment and technology. Development and technology expenses increased $4.3 million, or 28.7%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to a $2.1 million increase in depreciation expense, a $1.6 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, a $0.4 million increase in technology service expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in hardware and software maintenance and other operating expenses.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses increased $3.3 million, or 20.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.2 million increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount, $1.4 million one-time charge for salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for one of our executives who was terminated, and a $0.7 million increase in other marketing related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $4.9 million, or 28.0%, in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to a $1.7 million increase in personnel related expenses resulting from increased headcount, a $0.8 million increase in depreciation expenses, a $0.5 million increase in business licenses, taxes, and insurance, a $0.5 million increase in consulting expenses, and a $1.4 million increase in rent and other general and administrative expenses.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets expense remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014.\nInterest and Other (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest and other (expense) income, net, remained relatively consistent in 2015, as compared to 2014. In 2015, we incurred and capitalized $0.6 million of interest expense related to our Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe had income tax expense of $0.5 million in 2015, as compared to $0.7 million in 2014. Our effective tax rate decreased to 2.2% for 2015, as compared to 3.9% in 2014.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests decreased $0.6 million in 2015, as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of decreased net income for a subsidiary resulting from the transition of the managed and operated venues of this subsidiary from an end-user paid to a tiered pricing model.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders\nOur net loss for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the $23.9 million increase in costs and operating expenses, which was partially offset by the $20.3 million increase in revenues, the $0.6 million decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense. Our diluted net loss per share increased primarily as a result of the increase in our net loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $29.6 million in 2015, an increase of 46.0% from $20.3 million recorded in 2014. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 21.2% in 2015, up from 17.0% of revenue in 2014. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increases were partially offset by the $2.8 million increase in our net loss attributable to common stockholders, the $0.6 million decrease in non-controlling interests, and the $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense in 2015, as compared to 2014. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, income tax expense, interest and other expense, non-controlling interests, and excludes charges or gains that are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 1 to \"Selected Financial Data\" in Part II, Item 6.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility. Our primary sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2016 consisted of $19.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $54.8 million available for borrowing under our credit facility, $3.8 million of which is reserved for our outstanding Letter of Credit Authorization agreements.\nOur principal uses of liquidity have been to fund our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions. We expect that these requirements will be our principal needs for liquidity over the near term. Our capital expenditures in 2016 were $107.3 million, of which $76.9 million was reimbursed through revenue for DAS build-out projects from our telecom operators.\nWe have entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and related agreements, as amended with Bank of America, N.A. acting as agent for lenders named therein, including Bank of America, N.A. and Silicon Valley Bank, and Citizens Bank, N.A. (the \"Lenders\"), for a secured credit facility in the form of a revolving line of credit up to $69.8 million, which was increased from $46.5 million in February 2016, with an option to increase the available amount to $86.5 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (the \"Revolving Line of Credit\") and a term loan of $3.5 million (the \"Term Loan\" and together with the Revolving Line of Credit, the \"Credit Facility\"). Both the Term Loan and Revolving Line of Credit mature on November 21, 2018. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit and Term Loan will bear, at our election, a variable interest at LIBOR plus 2.5% - 3.5% or Lender's Prime Rate plus 1.5% - 2.5% per year and we will pay a fee of 0.375% - 0.5% per year on any unused portion of the Revolving Line of Credit. As of December 31, 2016, $2.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan and $15.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit. The Term Loan requires quarterly payments of interest and principal, amortizing fully over the four-year-term such that it is repaid in full on the maturity date of November 21, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest rates for our Credit Facility ranged from 3.0% to 3.6%. Repayment of amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility may be accelerated in the event that we are in violation of the representation, warranties and covenants made in the Credit Agreement, including certain financial covenants set forth therein, and under other specific default events including, but not limited to, non-payment or inability to pay debt, breach of cross default provisions, insolvency provisions, and change in control.\nWe are subject to customary covenants, including a minimum quarterly consolidated leverage ratio, a maximum quarterly consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and monthly liquidity minimums. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of December 31, 2016 and through the date of this report. We are subject to certain non-financial covenants, and we were also in compliance with all such non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2016 and through the date of this report. The Credit Facility provides us with significant additional flexibility and liquidity to pursue our strategic objectives for capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nOn September 11, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf Registration\") on Form S-3 with the SEC that was declared effective by the SEC on September 17, 2015, which permitted us to offer up to $125.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time. In February 2016, we filed a post-effective amendment to terminate the Shelf Registration and remove from registration the securities registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration. The Company's Board of Directors determined that having the Shelf Registration on file was no longer necessary due to the Company increasing the Revolving Line of Credit.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and availability under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our financial statements. There can be no assurance, however, that future industry-specific or other developments, general economic trends, or other matters will not adversely affect our operations or our ability to meet our future cash requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth and corresponding timing of cash collections, the timing and size of our managed and operated location expansion efforts, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. We expect our capital expenditures in 2017 will range from $20.0 million to $25.0 million, excluding capital expenditures for DAS build-out projects, which are reimbursed through revenue from our telecom operator customers. The majority of our 2017 capital expenditures will be used to build out and upgrade Wi-Fi networks at our managed and operated venues and to build out residential broadband and IPTV networks for troops stationed on\nmilitary bases pursuant to our contracts with the U.S. government. The investment of these resources will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them including generation of revenues. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts with us, either at its convenience or for default based on performance. Any such modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. We may also enter into acquisitions of complementary businesses, applications or technologies, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nThe following table sets forth cash flow data for the periods indicated therein:\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nIn 2016, we generated $115.2 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $16.6 million from 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $7.4 million change in our operating assets and liabilities, a $10.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to our recent increased fixed assets from our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development, and a $3.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses. The increases were partially offset by the $4.8 million increase in our net loss.\nIn 2015, we generated $98.6 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $77.4 million from 2014. The increase is primarily due to a $68.1 million change in our operating assets and liabilities, a $10.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, a $2.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, and a $0.7 million change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. The increases were partially offset by the $3.4 million increase in our net loss and the $0.7 million decrease in impairment losses.\nIn 2014, we generated $21.2 million of net cash from operating activities, an increase of $0.5 million from 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred revenue in 2014 compared to a $1.9 million decrease in 2013, a $10.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014, a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses in 2014, and a $1.0 million impairment loss in 2014. The increases were partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in our net loss including non-controlling interests from the prior year, a $9.0 million larger increase in accounts receivable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2014 compared to a $1.6 million decrease in 2013, a $2.0 million larger decrease in accounts payable in 2014 compared to 2013, a $1.1 million decrease in the change in deferred tax assets, and a $0.4 million increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nIn 2016, we used $107.3 million in investing activities, an increase of $5.8 million from 2015. This increase is due to a $4.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment related to our recent increased fixed assets from our DAS build-out projects, Wi-Fi networks, and software development, and a $1.6 million decrease in cash provided by net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nIn 2015, we used $101.5 million in investing activities, an increase of $62.3 million from 2014. This increase is primarily due to a $32.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and a $29.7 million decrease in cash provided by net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.\nIn 2014, we used $39.2 million in investing activities, a decrease of $1.2 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $22.8 million increase in cash received from net sales of marketable securities in 2014 compared to 2013, a $19.3 million decrease in cash used in acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013, and a $0.5 million decrease in restricted cash. The decreases were partially offset by a $41.4 million increase in purchases of property and equipment in 2014 compared to 2013.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nIn 2016, we used $3.1 million of cash for financing activities compared to $8.8 million in cash provided by financing activities in 2015. This change is primarily due to a $14.8 million decrease in net proceeds from our Credit Facility, a $1.4 million increase in cash paid for capital leases and notes payable, and a $0.3 million decrease in cash used to pay federal, state, and local employment payroll taxes related to our RSUs that vested during the period. These changes were partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options, $2.8 million of non-recurring payments made in 2015 related to business combinations, and a $0.2 million decrease in payments to our non-controlling interests.\nIn 2015, we received $8.8 million of cash provided by financing activities compared to $0.5 million in cash used in financing activities in 2014. This change is primarily due to the $11.5 million increase in net proceeds from our Credit Facility, a $1.2 million decrease in acquisition related payments, a $0.6 million decrease in deferred financing costs, and a $0.2 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options. These changes were partially offset by $1.6 million of holdback consideration payments made to the previous AWG shareholders, $1.2 million in payments to acquire the remaining non-controlling interests in Concourse Communications Detroit, LLC from the non-controlling interest owners, a $0.6 million increase in cash used to pay federal, state, and local employment payroll taxes related to our RSUs that vested during the period, and $0.9 million in repayments made on our Term Loan during 2015.\nIn 2014, we used $0.5 million in financing activities, a decrease of $10.6 million from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $10.9 million of cash used to repay notes payable and other financed liabilities that were assumed in our acquisition of Endeka and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market in 2013 that did not recur in 2014, $2.8 million of proceeds received from our Credit Facility, net of deferred financing costs that were paid, and a $0.5 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2014 compared to 2013. The decreases were partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in cash used to pay minimum statutory taxes related to our time-based RSUs that vested during 2014, $1.3 million of cash used to pay continent liabilities and other acquisition related consideration during 2014, and a $0.4 million increase in cash paid for capital leases and notes payable.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016:\n\n(1)Payments under exclusive long-term, non-cancellable contracts to provide wireless communications network access to venues such as airports. Expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n(2)Office space under non-cancellable operating leases.\n(3)Open purchase commitments are for the purchase of property and equipment, supplies and services. They are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 as we have not received the related goods or services.\n(4)Long-term debt associated with our Credit Agreement with Bank of America N.A. Payments are based on contractual terms and intended timing of repayments of long-term debt.\n(5)Leased equipment, primarily for data communication and database software, under non-cancellable capital leases.\n(6)The unrecognized tax benefits are related to uncertain tax positions taken in our income tax return that would impact the effective tax rate or additional paid-in capital, if recognized (refer to Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8).\n(7)Notes payable assumed in our acquisition of Endeka in 2013 and loans payable related to financed equipment and prepaid maintenance service purchases.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements and we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nTransactions with Related Parties\nUnder our Audit Committee charter, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions on a quarterly basis. In addition, our Board of Directors determines annually whether any related party relationships exist among the directors which would interfere with the judgment of individual directors in carrying out his responsibilities as director.\nInflation\nInflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years. A significant increase in inflation may affect our future performance since we may not be able to recover the increases in our costs with similar increases in our prices.", "item_7_tables": "Table 14:

report offers an insight into the company's financial condition and performance over recent years. As per the report:\n\n- The company believes it is a leading global provider of mobile Wi-Fi Internet solutions and indoor Distributed Antenna System (DAS) services, covering vast Wi-Fi networks and operating numerous DAS networks around the world.\n- Revenue grew from $139.6 million in 2015 to $159.3 million in 2016, marking a 14.1% increase, and had previously grown from $119.3 million in 2014 to $139.6 million in 2015, a 17% increase.\n- Despite this revenue growth, the company faced a net loss, which increased from $22.3 million in 2015 to $27.3 million in 2016. However, Adjusted EBITDA saw a significant rise from $29.6 million in 2015 to $40.8 million in 2016, which is 37.7% higher.\n- A contributing factor to the revenue growth is the surging demand for high-speed Internet due to the proliferation of devices requiring connectivity and high-bandwidth activities. The market trend suggests a potential increase in mobile data traffic forecast for the coming years, presenting growth opportunities for the company.\n- Additionally, the report reviews the company's significant accounting policies, revenue recognition practices, treatment of goodwill, how it handles long-lived assets and stock-based compensation, and how income taxes are recognized.\n- Furthermore, key business metrics such as the number of active DAS nodes, military and retail subscribers, and Wi-Fi connects are monitored, all of which indicate a measure of the company's operations and market reach.\n- Financial details about revenue streams from DAS, military, retail, wholesale Wi-Fi, and advertising are discussed along with their respective increases or decreases.\n- Costs and expenses, including network access, operations, development and technology, and sales and marketing are also elaborated, explaining the impact on net losses.\n- Notably, the company has a credit facility that is considered sufficient to cover operations and capital expenditures, and it does not appear to rely on off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\n\nOverall, the report provides a narrative of growth in revenue coupled with increases in net loss, while painting a positive Adjusted EBITDA. Financial strategies and prospects seem framed by significant market opportunities tied to the rising demand for Wi-Fi access, yet are also tempered by growing operating expenses and investments in infrastructure."}
