This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. See Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a women's health care company focused on creating and commercializing products targeted exclusively for women. Currently, we are focused on pursuing the regulatory approvals and pre-commercialization activities necessary for commercialization of our advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products. Our drug candidates that have completed clinical trials are designed to alleviate the symptoms of and reduce the health risks resulting from menopause-related hormone deficiencies, including hot flashes, and vaginal discomfort. We are developing these hormone therapy drug candidates, which contain estradiol and progesterone alone or in combination, with the aim of demonstrating clinical efficacy at lower doses, thereby enabling an enhanced side effect profile compared with competing products. With our SYMBODA\u2122 technology, we are developing advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products to enable delivery of bio-identical hormones through a variety of dosage forms and administration routes. In addition, we manufacture and distribute branded and generic prescription prenatal vitamins.\nResearch and Development - Overview\nWe have submitted two new drug applications, or NDAs, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our hormone therapy drug candidates. In December 2017, we submitted the NDA for TX-001HR, our bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17\u00df- estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel drug candidate, for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, or VMS, due to menopause in menopausal women with an intact uterus. In November 2017, we re-submitted our NDA for TX-004HR, our applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia (vaginal pain during sexual intercourse), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, or VVA, in menopausal women with vaginal linings that do not receive enough estrogen. The NDA for our TX-004HR drug candidate has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of May 29, 2018, and if approved on that date, the drug candidate could be launched as early as the third quarter of 2018. If the NDA for our TX-001HR drug candidate is accepted by the FDA, it could be approved as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018 and launched in 2019.\nTX-001HR\nTX-001HR is our bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17\u00df- estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause, including hot flashes, night sweats and sleep disturbances in menopausal women with an intact uterus. The hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to, or having the same chemical and molecular structure as, the hormones that naturally occur in a woman's body, namely estradiol and progesterone, and is being studied as a continuous-combined regimen, in which the combination of estrogen and progesterone are taken together in one product daily. If approved by the FDA, we believe this would represent the first time a combination product of estradiol and progesterone bioidentical to the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries would be approved for use in a single combined product.\nWe previously conducted a pharmacokinetics, or PK, study of TX-001HR to demonstrate that our drug candidate is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug based on the criterion that the 90% confidence interval on the test-to-reference ratio is contained entirely within the interval 80% to 125%. The study compared our combined capsule TX-001HR of 2 mg estradiol and 200 mg of progesterone to 2 mg of Estrace\u00ae and 200 mg of Prometrium\u00ae.\nThe study compared the mean plasma concentrations for free estradiol between TX-001HR and Estrace\u00ae in 62 female test subjects. When the results of a single dose-fed study were compared over 48 hours by the test drug versus reference drug, the ratio was 0.93 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.409 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.089. The maximum plasma concentration levels of free estradiol showed that the drug -versus -reference drug ratio was 0.88 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.344 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.040 over 48 hours.\nThe study also compared the mean plasma concentrations for progesterone between TX-001HR and Prometrium\u00ae in 62 female test subjects. When the results were compared over 48 hours of the test that the drug-versus-reference drug, the ratio was 1.05 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.956 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.542. The maximum plasma concentration levels of progesterone showed drug versus reference drug ratio as 1.16 with the standard deviation within the subject being 1.179 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.785 over 48 hours.\nOn September 5, 2013, we began enrollment in the REPLENISH Trial, a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial of TX-001HR in menopausal women with an intact uterus. The trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of TX-001HR for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause and the endometrial safety of TX-001HR. Patients were assigned to one of five arms, four active and one placebo, and received study medication for 12 months. The primary endpoint for the reduction of endometrial hyperplasia was an incidence of endometrial hyperplasia of less than 1% at 12 months, as determined by endometrial biopsy. The primary endpoint for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS was the mean change of frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS at weeks four and 12 compared to placebo, as measured by the number and severity of hot flashes. Only subjects experiencing a minimum daily frequency of seven moderate to severe hot flashes at screening were included in the VMS analysis, while all subjects were included in the endometrial hyperplasia analysis. The secondary endpoints included reduction in sleep disturbances and improvement in quality of life measures, night sweats and vaginal dryness, measured at 12 weeks, six months and 12 months. The trial evaluated 1,835 patients between 40 and 65 years old at 111 sites. On December 5, 2016, we announced positive topline data for the REPLENISH Trial.\nThe REPLENISH Trial evaluated four doses of TX-001HR and placebo; the doses studied were:\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf </td> <td> 17\u00df-estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 416) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf </td> <td> 17\u00df-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 423) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf </td> <td> 17\u00df-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 421) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf </td> <td> 17\u00df-estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 424) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf </td> <td> Placebo (n = 151) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe REPLENISH Trial results demonstrated:\n\u25cf TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both achieved all four of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and the primary safety endpoint.\n\u25cf TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both the frequency and severity of hot flashes compared to placebo.\n\u25cf TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg were not statistically significant at all of the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg dose was included in the clinical trial as a non-effective dose to meet the recommendation of the FDA guidance to identify the lowest effective dose.\n\u25cf The incidence of consensus endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was 0 percent across all four TX-001HR doses, meeting the recommendations established by the FDA's draft guidance.\nAs outlined in the FDA guidance, the co-primary efficacy endpoints in the REPLENISH Trial were the change from baseline in the number and severity of hot flashes at weeks four and 12 as compared to placebo. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia with up to 12 months of treatment. General safety was also evaluated.\nThe results of the REPLENISH Trial are summarized in the table below (p-values of < 0.05 meet FDA guidance and support evidence of efficacy):\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> Replenish Trial Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints: Mean Change in Frequency and Severity of Hot Flashes Per Week Versus Placebo at Weeks 4 and 12, VMS-MITT Population </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estradiol/Progesterone </td> <td> 1 mg/100 mg </td> <td> 0.5 mg/100 mg </td> <td> 0.5 mg/50 mg </td> <td> 0.25 mg/50 mg </td> <td> Placebo </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (n = 141) </td> <td> (n = 149) </td> <td> (n = 147) </td> <td> (n = 154) </td> <td> (n = 135) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Frequency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 4 P-value versus placebo </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> 0.013 </td> <td> 0.141 </td> <td> 0.001 </td> <td> - </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 12 P-value versus placebo </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> 0.002 </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> - </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Severity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 4 P-value versus placebo </td> <td> 0.031 </td> <td> 0.005 </td> <td> 0.401 </td> <td> 0.100 </td> <td> - </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 12 P-value versus placebo </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> 0.018 </td> <td> 0.096 </td> <td> - </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Replenish Trial Primary Safety Endpoint: Incidence of Consensus Endometrial Hyperplasia or Malignancy up to 12 months, Endometrial Safety Population\u0166 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Endometrial Hyperplasia </td> <td> 0% (0/280) </td> <td> 0% (0/303) </td> <td> 0% (0/306) </td> <td> 0% (0/274) </td> <td> 0% (0/92) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMITT = Modified intent to treat\n\u0166Per FDA, consensus hyperplasia refers to the concurrence of two of the three pathologists be accepted as the final diagnosis\nWe submitted the NDA for TX-001HR with the FDA on December 28, 2017. Assuming that the NDA is accepted 74 days thereafter and an FDA review period of ten months from the receipt date to the PDUFA target action date for a non-new molecular entity, the NDA for TX-001HR could be approved by the FDA as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTX-002HR\nTX-002HR is a natural progesterone formulation for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea without the potentially allergenic component of peanut oil. The hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to - or having the same chemical and molecular structure as - the hormones that naturally occur in a woman's body. We believe it will be similarly effective to traditional treatments, but may demonstrate efficacy at lower dosages. In January 2014, we began recruitment of patients in the SPRY Trial, a phase 3 clinical trial designed to measure the safety and effectiveness of TX-002HR in the treatment of secondary amenorrhea. During the first two quarters of 2014, the SPRY Trial encountered enrollment challenges because of Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approved clinical trial protocols and FDA inclusion and exclusion criteria. In July 2014, we suspended enrollment and in October 2014 we stopped the SPRY Trial in order to update the phase 3 protocol based on discussions with the FDA. Our IND related to TX-002HR is currently in inactive status. We are considering updating the phase 3 protocol to, among other things, target only those women with secondary amenorrhea due to polycystic ovarian syndrome and to amend the primary endpoint of the trial. We believe that the updated phase 3 protocol, if proposed by us and approved by the FDA, would allow us to mitigate the enrollment challenges in, and shorten the duration of, the SPRY Trial. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will approve the updated phase 3 protocol if we propose it. We have currently suspended further development of this drug candidate to prioritize our leading drug candidates.\nTX-003HR\nTX-003HR is a natural estradiol formulation. This hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to the hormones that naturally occur in a woman's body. We currently do not have plans to further develop this hormone therapy drug candidate. Our IND related to TX-003HR is currently inactive.\nTX-004HR\nTX-004HR is our applicator free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA in menopausal women with vaginal linings that do not receive enough estrogen. We believe that our drug candidate will be at least as effective as the traditional treatments for VVA because of an early onset of action with less systemic exposure, and it will have an added advantage of being a more simple, easier to use dosage form versus traditional VVA treatments. We initiated the REJOICE Trial, a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial during the third quarter of 2014 to assess the safety and efficacy of three doses - 25 mcg, 10 mcg and 4 mcg (compared to placebo) - of TX-004HR for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, or painful intercourse, as a symptom of VVA due to menopause.\nOn November 10, 2015, the FDA held a scientific workshop on labeling lower\u201d dose estrogen-alone products for symptoms of VVA to provide an opportunity for the FDA to obtain input from experts on several topics related to the product label of lower dose estrogen-alone products approved solely for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of VVA due to menopause. According to the FDA, lower-dose estrogen products means products that contain less than the 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens used in the WHI study and estradiol products containing 0.0375 mg and below. Discussion topics at the workshop included the relevance of the boxed warnings based on data from the WHI to the lower dose estrogen-alone products; certain members in the scientific/medical community have questioned whether the boxed warnings section in the labeling, which is currently required to be included on all estrogen products, is applicable in whole or in part to these lower-dose estrogen products. The boxed warnings include: (1) an increased risk of endometrial cancer in women with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens, (2) estrogen therapy with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, (3) an increased risk of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in women treated with estrogen-alone, (4) an increased risk of probable dementia in post-menopausal women 65 years of age and older treated with estrogen-alone, (5) an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women treated with estrogen plus progestin, and (6) to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. It is unknown at this time what, if any, changes the FDA may propose with respect to the boxed warnings on lower dose estrogen-alone products for symptoms of VVA or whether such label changes would be applicable to TX-004HR, if approved.\nOn December 7, 2015, we announced positive top-line results from the REJOICE Trial. The pre-specified four co-primary efficacy endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 12 versus placebo in the percentage of vaginal superficial cells, percentage of vaginal parabasal cells, vaginal pH and severity of participants' self-reported moderate to severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom of VVA. The trial enrolled 764 menopausal women (40 to 75 years old) experiencing moderate to severe dyspareunia at approximately 89 sites across the United States and Canada. Trial participants were randomized to receive either TX-004HR at 25 mcg (n=190), 10 mcg (n=191), or 4 mcg (n=191) doses or placebo (n=192) for a total of 12 weeks, all administered once daily for two weeks and then twice weekly (approximately three to four days apart) for ten weeks.\nThe following table sets forth the statistical significance of the REJOICE Trial results for the four pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints, based on mean changes from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo. Based on our analyses of the REJOICE Trial data, statistical significance of the results for the co-primary endpoint of severity of participants' self-reported moderate to severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom of VVA has improved for all three doses from the results originally reported.\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25 mcg </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10 mcg </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4 mcg </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Superficial Cells </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Parabasal Cells </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vaginal pH </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severity of Dyspareunia </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 25 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo across all four co-primary endpoints. The 10 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo across all four co-primary endpoints. The 4 mcg dose of TX-004HR also demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo for the endpoints of vaginal superficial cells, vaginal parabasal cells, and vaginal pH; the change from baseline compared to placebo in the severity of dyspareunia was statistically significant at the p = 0.0149 level. The FDA has previously indicated to us that in order to approve the drug based on a single trial, the trial would need to show statistical significance at the 0.01 level or lower for each endpoint, and that a trial that is merely statistically significant at a higher level may not provide sufficient evidence to support an NDA filing or approval of a drug candidate where the NDA relies on a single clinical trial.\nStatistical improvement over placebo was also observed for all three doses at the first assessment at week two and sustained through week 12 (see table below).\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25 mcg </td> <td> </td> <td> 10 mcg </td> <td> </td> <td> 4 mcg </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 2 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0105 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0019 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.026 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 6 </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0009 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0069 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 8 </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0003 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 12 </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nVaginal dryness was a prespecified key secondary endpoint. The 25 mcg and 10 mcg doses of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo for the endpoint of vaginal dryness. The 4 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated statistically significant results at the p = 0.0014 level compared to placebo (see table below).\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25 mcg </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10 mcg </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4 mcg </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severity of Vaginal Dryness </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe pharmacokinetic data for all three doses demonstrated negligible to very low systemic absorption of 17 beta estradiol, estrone and estrone conjugated, supporting the previous phase 1 trial data. TX-004HR was well tolerated, and there were no clinically significant differences compared to placebo-treated participants with respect to adverse events. There were no drug-related serious adverse events reported.\nWe submitted the NDA for TX-004HR with the FDA on July 7, 2016. The FDA determined that the NDA was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and accepted the NDA for filing with the PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of May 7, 2017. The NDA submission was supported by the complete TX-004HR clinical program, including positive results of the phase 3 REJOICE Trial. The NDA submission included all three doses of TX-004HR (4 mcg, 10 mcg and 25 mcg) that were evaluated in the REJOICE Trial.\nOn May 5, 2017, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding the NDA for TX-004HR. In the CRL, the only approvability concern raised by the FDA was the lack of long-term safety data for TX-004HR beyond the 12 weeks studied in the phase 3 REJOICE Trial. The CRL did not identify any issues related to the efficacy of TX-004HR and did not identify any approvability issues related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls.\nOn June 14, 2017, we participated in a Type A Post-Action Meeting with the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products (DBRUP) of the FDA to discuss the CRL. At the meeting, we presented information that we believed could address concerns raised by the FDA in the CRL. On July 5, 2017, we received the official minutes of the meeting from the FDA, which provided the FDA's response to the information presented at the Type A meeting. Per the FDA's request, we formally submitted the information presented at the Type A meeting for consideration related to the NDA for TX-004HR.\nOn August 3, 2017, we received a formal General Advice Letter from the FDA stating that an initial review of this information has been completed and requesting that we submit the additional endometrial safety information to the NDA for TX-004HR on or before September 18, 2017. On September 14, 2017, we submitted the additional endometrial safety information that was requested by the FDA in the General Advice Letter to the NDA for TX-004HR. The submission included a comprehensive, systematic review of the medical literature on the use of vaginal estrogen products and the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, including the safety data from the recently published Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, or WHI Study, of vaginal estrogen use in post-menopausal women and information on the relevance of the first uterine pass effect for low-dose vaginal estrogen products. The WHI Study demonstrated no significant difference in the risk of invasive breast cancer, stroke, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolism in vaginal estrogen users versus non-users. The WHI Study also shows that, among women with an intact uterus, there was a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, hip fracture and all-cause mortality in vaginal estrogen users versus non-users. The WHI Study evaluated over 4,000 women who used vaginal estrogens for a median duration of two to three years.\nOn November 3, 2017, we participated in an in-person meeting with DBRUP. At the meeting, DBRUP agreed to the resubmission of the NDA for the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses of TX-004HR without the need for an additional pre-approval study.\nOn November 29, 2017, we resubmitted the NDA for the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses of TX-004HR with the FDA. We have committed to conduct a post-approval observational study. The FDA has acknowledged that the resubmission is a complete, class 2 response to the CRL received on May 5, 2017 for TX-004HR. The PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA's review is May 29, 2018. If approved, the 4 mcg formulation of TX-004HR would represent a lower effective dose than the currently available VVA therapies approved by the FDA.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nA significant portion of our operating expenses to date have been incurred in research and development activities. Research and development expenses relate primarily to the discovery and development of our drug products. Our business model is dependent upon our company continuing to conduct a significant amount of research and development. Other research and development\u201d costs in the table below consist of products costs incurred prior to IND approval from the FDA as well as other clinical and regulatory consulting costs. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, investigative sites, and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical studies; employee-related expenses, which include salaries and benefits, and non-cash share-based compensation; the cost of developing our chemistry, manufacturing and controls capabilities, and acquiring clinical trial materials; and costs associated with other research activities and regulatory approvals.\nWe make payments to the CROs based on agreed upon terms that may include payments in advance of a study starting date. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. Advance payments to be expensed in future research and development activities were $0, $228,933 and $1,138,073, at December 31, 2017, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nThe following table indicates our research and development expense by project for the periods indicated:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(000s) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>TX-001HR </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,227 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>TX-002HR </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>TX-004HR </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,574 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other research and development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,219 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,043 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenditures will continue to be incurred as we continue development of our drug candidates and advance the development of our proprietary pipeline of novel drug candidates. We expect to incur ongoing research and development costs as we develop our drug pipeline, continue stability testing and validation on our drug candidates, prepare regulatory submissions and work with regulatory authorities on existing submissions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in February 2013, we have incurred approximately $19,381,000 and $115,397,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-001HR, our combination estradiol and progesterone drug candidate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in April 2013, we have incurred approximately $0 and $2,525,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-002HR, our progesterone only drug candidate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in August 2014, we have incurred approximately $8,043,000 and $40,849,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-004HR, our vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate.\nThe costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to factors that include, but are not limited to, the following: per patient trial costs; the number of patients that participate in the trials; the number of sites included in the trials; the length of time each patient is enrolled in the trial; the number of doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; the amount of time required to recruit patients for the trial; the duration of patient follow-up; and the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate. We base our expenses related to clinical trials on estimates that are based on our experience and estimates from CROs and other third parties. Research and development expenditures for the drug candidates will continue after the trial completes for on-going stability and laboratory testing, regulatory submission and response work.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with year ended December 31, 2016\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (000s) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 16,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 19,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (2,578 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,548 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 91,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 105,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (13,655 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (77,628 </td> <td> ) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (90,253 </td> <td> ) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,625 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (76,925 </td> <td> ) </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (89,875 </td> <td> ) </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 12,950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue is recorded net of sales discounts, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, customer rebates, coupons and estimated returns.

This decrease was attributable to a decrease in the average net revenue per unit of our products, primarily related to higher coupons in 2017 due to implementation of a new point of sale coupon system, partially offset by a slight increase in the number of units sold.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold decreased by approximately $1,548,000, or 37%, to approximately $2,637,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately $4,185,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to lower distribution costs. Our gross margins was 84% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 78% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the centralization of the distribution channel for both our retail pharmacy distributors and wholesale distributors which, among other things, lowered the cost to package, prepare and deliver our products to customers.\nOperating Expenses\nOur principal operating costs included the following items as a percentage of total operating expenses.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Human resource related costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales and marketing costs, excluding human resource costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product research and development costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees and consulting costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses decreased by approximately $13,655,000, or 13%, to approximately $91,769,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately $105,424,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the following items:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (000s) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development costs </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 33,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 53,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (20,090 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Human resource related costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing, excluding human resource costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional and consulting costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,105 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 91,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 105,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (13,655 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by approximately $20,090,000, or 37%, to approximately $33,853,000, primarily as a result of a decrease in costs related to our phase 3 clinical trials of TX-001HR and TX-004HR, partially offset by scale-up and manufacturing activities for our phase 3 clinical trials of TX-001HR and TX-004HR and costs related to regulatory submission related to TX-001HR.

Business - Pharmaceutical Regulation.\u201d Future milestones, including NDA submission dates, are not easily determinable as such milestones are dependent on various factors related to our clinical trials, including the timing of ongoing patient recruitment efforts to find eligible subjects for the applicable trials.\nHuman resource related costs, including salaries and benefits, increased by approximately $9,633,000, or 64%, to approximately $24,599,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $14,966,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of an increase of approximately $3,492,000 in personnel costs in sales, marketing and regulatory areas to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates and an increase in non-cash compensation expense included in this category of approximately $6,141,000 related to employee stock option amortization during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nSales and marketing costs increased approximately $6,833,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 115%, to approximately $12,753,000, compared with approximately $5,920,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increased expenses associated with sales and marketing efforts to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates coupled with an increase in employee incentives.\nProfessional and consulting costs increased approximately $1,652,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 45%, to approximately $5,301,000 compared with approximately $3,649,000 for the year December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increased legal, consulting, accounting expenses.\nAll other costs increased approximately $4,579,000, or 108%, to approximately $8,828,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $4,249,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of a write-off of accounts receivable balances of approximately $2,200,000, increased insurance, rent, information technology and other office expenses.\nOperating Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, our operating loss increased approximately $5,063,000, or 6%, to approximately $90,253,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $85,190,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increased personnel costs, sales and marketing expenses to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates, coupled with a write-off of accounts receivable balances mentioned above and an increase in non-cash compensation expense, professional fees and other operating expenses as well a decrease in revenue, partially offset by a decrease in research and development costs.\nAs a result of the continued development of our hormone therapy drug candidates, we anticipate that we will continue to have operating losses for the near future until our hormone therapy drug candidates are approved by the FDA and brought to market, although there is no assurance that we will attain such approvals or that any marketing of our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, will be successful.\nOther Income\nOther non-operating income increased by approximately $265,000, or 235%, to approximately $378,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with approximately $113,000 for the comparable period in 2015, primarily as a result of increased interest income.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the net effects of the foregoing, net loss increased approximately $4,798,000, or 6%, to approximately $89,875,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $85,077,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loss per share of common stock, basic and diluted, was ($0.46) for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with ($0.49) per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have funded our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock and private placements of equity and debt securities. For the three-year period ending December 31, 2017, we received approximately $294,811,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we had a cash balance of approximately $127,136,000, however, changing circumstances may cause us to consume funds significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control.\nOn September 25, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC relating to an underwritten public offering of 12,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.55 per share. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $68,573,000, after deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us. The offering closed on September 28, 2017 and we issued 12,400,000 shares of our common stock. We intend to use a majority of the net proceeds from this offering to fund pre-commercialization and commercialization activities for our TX-004HR and TX-001HR drug candidates. We currently intend to fund the next phase of our pre-commercialization and commercialization expenses for our TX-004HR and TX-001HR drug candidates through debt financing and are currently engaged in discussions to secure debt financing commitments. If we are successful in obtaining these commitments, we currently anticipate we would begin to draw on them following approval of either TX-004HR or TX-001HR.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, our days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 97 days compared to 92 days for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in our DSO as of December 31, 2017 was partially related to implementation of a new point of sale coupon system which lowered our revenues, as well as to the timing of payments received from our customers subsequent to December 31, 2017. We anticipate that our DSO will fluctuate in the future based upon a variety of factors, including longer payment terms associated with the centralization of the distribution channel for both our retail pharmacy distributors and wholesale distributors, as compared to the terms previously provided to our retail pharmacy distributors, changes in the healthcare industry and specific terms that may be extended in connection with the launch of our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved.\nWe believe that our existing cash will allow us to fund our operating plan through at least the next 12 months from the date of this Annual Report. However, if the commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates is delayed, our existing cash may be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements until we are able to commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates. If our available cash is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may curtail our sales, marketing and other pre-commercialization efforts and we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing shareholders. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or proposed products. Additionally, we may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe need substantial amounts of cash to complete the clinical development of and commercialize of our hormone therapy drug candidates. The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below:\nSummary of (Uses) and Sources of Cash\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash flows used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(76,155,614 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(69,142,333 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(79,044,199 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash flows used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(827,108 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,255,456 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(584,361 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash flows provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,584,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,225,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,973,228 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe principal use of cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was to fund our current expenses primarily related to supporting clinical development, scale-up and manufacturing activities and future commercial activities, adjusted for non-cash items. The increase of approximately $7,013,000 in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to changes in the components of working capital and lower non-cash compensation expense, as well as a decrease in net loss.\nThe decrease of approximately $9,902,000 in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to an increase in our net loss adjusted for non-cash compensation expense and changes in the components of working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease of approximately $428,000 in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in patent costs and costs relating to the purchase of fixed assets.\nThe increase of approximately $671,000 in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in patent costs and the increase in costs relating to the purchase of fixed assets.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities represent the principal source of our cash flow. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 provided net cash of approximately $72,584,000. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 included approximately $68,573,000 in proceeds from sale of our common stock and approximately $4,011,000 in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants.\nOn September 25, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC relating to an underwritten public offering of 12,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.55 per share. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $68,573,000, after deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us. The offering closed on September 28, 2017 and we issued 12,400,000 shares of our common stock.\nOur financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 provided net cash of approximately $137,226,000. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 included approximately $134,864,000 in proceeds from sale of our common stock and approximately $2,362,000 in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants.\nOn January 6, 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Cowen and Company, LLC, as the representatives of the several underwriters, or Underwriters, relating to an underwritten public offering of 15,151,515 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.25 per share. Under the terms of the underwriting agreement, we granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,272,727 additional shares of common stock, which option was exercised in full. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $134,864,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. The offering closed on January 12, 2016 and we issued 17,424,242 shares of our common stock.\nOur financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 provided net cash of approximately $92,973,000. The cash provided by financing activities included approximately $91,375,000 in proceeds from sale of our common stock and approximately $1,598,000 in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants.\nOn July 9, 2015, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and Guggenheim Securities, LLC, as the representatives of the several underwriters, or the Stifel Underwriters, relating to an underwritten public offering of 3,846,154 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.80 per share. Under the terms of the underwriting agreement, we granted the Stifel Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 576,923 additional shares of our common stock, which option was exercised in full. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $32,257,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expense payable by us. The offering closed on July 15, 2015 and we issued 4,423,077 shares of our common stock.\nOn February 10, 2015, we entered into an underwriting agreement, or the Cowen Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, as the representative of the several underwriters, or the Cowen Underwriters, relating to an underwritten public offering of 13,580,246 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $4.05 per share. Under the terms of the Cowen Agreement, we granted the Cowen Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,037,036 additional shares of our common stock, which option was exercised in full. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $59,118,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expense payable by us. The offering closed February 17, 2015 and we issued 15,617,282 shares of our common stock.\nCritical Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf </td> <td> it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf </td> <td> changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our estimates and judgments on our experience, our current knowledge, our beliefs of what could occur in the future, our observation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties: share-based compensation expense and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue on arrangements in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nPrescription Products\nWe sell our name brand and generic prescription products primarily through wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy distributors. We recognize revenue from prescription product sales, net of sales discounts, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, customer rebates, coupons and estimated returns.\nRevenue related to prescription products sold through wholesale distributors is recognized when the prescription products are shipped to the distributors and the control of the products passes to each distributor. We accept returns of unsalable prescription products sold through wholesale distributors within a return period of six months prior to and up to 12 months following product expiration. Our prescription products currently have a shelf life of 24 months from the date of manufacture.\nPrior to September 1, 2016, we recognized revenue related to prescription products sold through retail pharmacy distributors when the product was dispensed by the retail pharmacy distributor, at which point all revenue and discounts related to such product were known or determinable and there was no right of return with respect to such product. On September 1, 2016, we centralized the distribution channel for both our retail pharmacy distributors and wholesale distributors, in order to facilitate sales to a broader population of retail pharmacies and mitigate exposure to any one retail pharmacy. Beginning on September 1, 2016, all of our prescription products are distributed under the wholesale distributor model described above.\nWe offer various rebate programs in an effort to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace and to promote sales and customer loyalty. We estimate the allowance for consumer rebates and coupons that we have offered based on our experience and industry averages, which is reviewed, and adjusted if necessary, on a quarterly basis. We record distributor fees based on amounts stated in contracts and estimate chargebacks based on the number of units sold each period.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development, or R&D, expenses include internal R&D activities, services of external contract research organizations, or CROs, costs of their clinical research sites, manufacturing, scale-up and validation costs, and other activities. Internal R&D activity expenses include laboratory supplies, salaries, benefits, and non-cash share-based compensation expenses. Advance payments to be expensed in future research and development activities are capitalized, and were $0 and $228,933 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, all of which was included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. CRO activity expenses include preclinical laboratory experiments and clinical trial studies. Other activity expenses include regulatory consulting and legal fees and costs. The activities undertaken by our regulatory consultants that were classified as R&D expenses include assisting, consulting with, and advising our in-house staff with respect to various FDA submission processes, clinical trial processes, and scientific writing matters, including preparing protocols and FDA submissions. Legal activities that were classified as R&D expenses include professional research and advice regarding R&D, patents and regulatory matters. These consulting and legal expenses were direct costs associated with preparing, reviewing, and undertaking work for our clinical trials and investigative drugs. We charge internal R&D activities and other activity expenses to operations as incurred. We make payments to CROs based on agreed-upon terms, which may include payments in advance of a study starting date. We expense nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future R&D activities when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. We review and accrue CRO expenses and clinical trial study expenses based on services performed and rely on estimates of those costs applicable to the completion stage of a study as provided by CROs. Estimated accrued CRO costs are subject to revisions as such studies progress to completion. We charge revisions expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nShare-Based Compensation. We measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements may include options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance-based awards, and share appreciation rights. We amortize such compensation amounts, if any, over the respective service periods of the award. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, or the Black-Scholes Model, an acceptable model in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to value options. Option valuation models require the input of assumptions, including the expected life of the stock-based awards, the estimated stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term of the instrument. Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the term of the award. Prior to January 1, 2017, the expected volatility of share options was estimated based on a historical volatility analysis of peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available that were similar to our company with respect to industry, stage of life cycle, market capitalization, and financial leverage. On January 1, 2017, we began using our own stock price in our volatility calculation along with two other peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available that were similar to our company. Our calculation of estimated volatility is based on historical stock prices over a period equal to the expected term of the awards. The average expected life of warrants is based on the contractual terms of the awards. The average expected life of options is based on the contractual terms of the stock option using the simplified method. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. Calculating share-based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions, estimates of expected life of the share-based award, stock price volatility and risk-free interest rates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nEquity instruments ( instruments\u201d) issued to non-employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by ASC 505, Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees, or ASC 505. ASC 505 defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is when either (a) a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The estimated expense is recognized each period based on the current fair value of the award. As a result, the amount of expense related to awards to non-employees can fluctuate significantly during the period from the date of the grant through the final measurement date. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in ASC 505. We recognize the compensation expense for all share-based compensation granted based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with ASC 718. We generally recognize the compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period. We adopted ASU 2016-09, effective January 1, 2017, electing to account for forfeitures when they occur. Prior to that, we estimated the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience of forfeitures.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates when the rate change is enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nIn accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, we recognize the effect of uncertain income tax positions only if the positions are more likely than not of being sustained in an audit, based on the technical merits of the position. We measure recognized uncertain income tax positions using the largest amount that has a likelihood of being realized that is greater than 50%. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which those changes in judgment occur. We recognize both interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no tax positions relating to open tax returns that were considered to be uncertain. Our tax returns are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service three years after they are filed. Currently, years filed after 2013 are subject to review.\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In spite of our belief that we have appropriate support for all the positions taken on our tax returns, we acknowledge that certain positions may be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities. We determine the tax benefits more likely than not to be recognized with respect to uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and inherent uncertainty; therefore, our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely on estimates and assumptions. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, the final determination could be materially different than that which is reflected in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. federal tax code, including, but not limited to reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we have recorded a decrease related to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $49,500,000 and approximately $2,800,000, respectively, with a corresponding net adjustment to the valuation allowance of approximately $46,700,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Act modifies Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, by (1) expanding which employees are considered covered employees by including the chief financial officer, (2) providing that if an individual is a covered employee for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, the individual remains a covered employee for all future years, and (3) removing the exceptions for compensation stemming from contracts entered into on or before November 2, 2017, unless such contracts were materially modified on or after the date. Compensation agreements entered into and share-based payment awards granted after this date will be subject to the revised terms of IRC Section 162(m). In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting for share-based compensation arrangements under the Tax Act to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We must assess whether our valuation allowance analyses are affected by various aspects of the Tax Act. Since, as discussed herein, we have recorded provisional amounts related to certain portions of the Tax Act, any corresponding determination of the need for or change in a valuation allowance is also provisional.\nSegment Reporting. We are managed and operated as one business, which is focused on creating and commercializing products targeted exclusively for women. Our business operations are managed by a single management team that reports to the President of our Company. We do not operate separate lines of business with respect to any of our products and we do not prepare discrete financial information with respect to separate products. All product sales are derived from sales in the United States. Accordingly, we view our business as one reportable operating segment.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements . In May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-09 that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The new guidance will reduce diversity in practice and result in fewer changes to the terms of an award being accounted for as modifications. The new guidance will allow companies to make certain changes to awards without accounting for them as modifications. This guidance does not change the accounting for modifications. The guidance will be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period. We adopted this guidance and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application. We adopted this guidance and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017, electing to account for forfeitures when they occur. The impact from adoption of the provisions related to forfeiture rates was reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a modified retrospective basis, resulting in an adjustment of approximately $31,000 to retained earnings. The impact from adoption of the provisions related to excess tax benefits or deficiencies in the provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital was adopted on a modified retrospective basis. Since we have a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, an amount equal to the cumulative adjustment made to retained earnings to recognize the previously unrecognized net operating losses from prior periods was made to the valuation allowance through retained earnings for the first quarter financial statements. Adoption of all other changes did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This guidance requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. The guidance also eliminates current real estate-specific provisions for all entities. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The standard is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. We are in the process of analyzing the quantitative impact of this guidance on our results of operations and financial position. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe the impact of this standard will be primarily related to the accounting for our operating lease.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under previous guidance. This may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB approved the proposal to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 standard by one year. Early adoption is permitted after December 15, 2016, and the standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. In 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify the implementation guidance for principal versus agent considerations (ASU 2016-08), accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations (ASU 2016-10), narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients (ASU 2016-12) and technical corrections and improvements to topic 606 (ASU 2016-20) in its new revenue standard. We have performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and are monitoring the activity of the FASB and the transition resource group as it relates to specific interpretive guidance. We have reviewed customer contracts and applied the five-step model of the new standard to our contracts as well as compared the results to our current accounting practices. We are currently in the process of drafting disclosures required by the new standard. At this point of our analysis, we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements but will potentially expand our disclosures related to contracts with customers.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions, which, in our judgment, are normal and customary for companies in our industry sector. These agreements are typically with business partners, clinical sites, and suppliers. Pursuant to these agreements, we generally agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to our drug candidates, use of such drug candidates, or other actions taken or omitted by us. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. We have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nIn the normal course of business, we may be confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits, claims, environmental actions or the actions of various regulatory agencies. We consult with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim. If, in our opinion, we have incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in our financial statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nFor each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 is as follows:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Lease Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,101,506 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>951,194 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,207,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>943,127 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently involved in any legal proceeding that we believe would have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEmployment Agreements\nWe have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executives that provide for compensation and certain other benefits. Under certain circumstances, including a change in control, some of these agreements provide for severance or other payments, if those circumstances occur during the term of the employment agreement.\nSeasonality\nThe specialty pharmaceutical industry component of women's health is not subject to seasonal sales fluctuation.\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>",

Currently, we are focused on pursuing the regulatory approvals and pre-commercialization activities necessary for commercialization of our advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products. Our drug candidates that have completed clinical trials are designed to alleviate the symptoms of and reduce the health risks resulting from menopause-related hormone deficiencies, including hot flashes, and vaginal discomfort. We are developing these hormone therapy drug candidates, which contain estradiol and progesterone alone or in combination, with the aim of demonstrating clinical efficacy at lower doses, thereby enabling an enhanced side effect profile compared with competing products. With our SYMBODA\u2122 technology, we are developing advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products to enable delivery of bio-identical hormones through a variety of dosage forms and administration routes. In addition, we manufacture and distribute branded and generic prescription prenatal vitamins.\nResearch and Development - Overview\nWe have submitted two new drug applications, or NDAs, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our hormone therapy drug candidates. In December 2017, we submitted the NDA for TX-001HR, our bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17\u00df- estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel drug candidate, for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, or VMS, due to menopause in menopausal women with an intact uterus. In November 2017, we re-submitted our NDA for TX-004HR, our applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia (vaginal pain during sexual intercourse), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, or VVA, in menopausal women with vaginal linings that do not receive enough estrogen. The NDA for our TX-004HR drug candidate has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of May 29, 2018, and if approved on that date, the drug candidate could be launched as early as the third quarter of 2018. If the NDA for our TX-001HR drug candidate is accepted by the FDA, it could be approved as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018 and launched in 2019.\nTX-001HR\nTX-001HR is our bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17\u00df- estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause, including hot flashes, night sweats and sleep disturbances in menopausal women with an intact uterus. The hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to, or having the same chemical and molecular structure as, the hormones that naturally occur in a woman's body, namely estradiol and progesterone, and is being studied as a continuous-combined regimen, in which the combination of estrogen and progesterone are taken together in one product daily. If approved by the FDA, we believe this would represent the first time a combination product of estradiol and progesterone bioidentical to the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries would be approved for use in a single combined product.\nWe previously conducted a pharmacokinetics, or PK, study of TX-001HR to demonstrate that our drug candidate is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug based on the criterion that the 90% confidence interval on the test-to-reference ratio is contained entirely within the interval 80% to 125%. The study compared our combined capsule TX-001HR of 2 mg estradiol and 200 mg of progesterone to 2 mg of Estrace\u00ae and 200 mg of Prometrium\u00ae.\nThe study compared the mean plasma concentrations for free estradiol between TX-001HR and Estrace\u00ae in 62 female test subjects. When the results of a single dose-fed study were compared over 48 hours by the test drug versus reference drug, the ratio was 0.93 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.409 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.089. The maximum plasma concentration levels of free estradiol showed that the drug -versus -reference drug ratio was 0.88 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.344 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.040 over 48 hours.\nThe study also compared the mean plasma concentrations for progesterone between TX-001HR and Prometrium\u00ae in 62 female test subjects. When the results were compared over 48 hours of the test that the drug-versus-reference drug, the ratio was 1.05 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.956 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.542. The maximum plasma concentration levels of progesterone showed drug versus reference drug ratio as 1.16 with the standard deviation within the subject being 1.179 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.785 over 48 hours.\nOn September 5, 2013, we began enrollment in the REPLENISH Trial, a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial of TX-001HR in menopausal women with an intact uterus. The trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of TX-001HR for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause and the endometrial safety of TX-001HR. Patients were assigned to one of five arms, four active and one placebo, and received study medication for 12 months. The primary endpoint for the reduction of endometrial hyperplasia was an incidence of endometrial hyperplasia of less than 1% at 12 months, as determined by endometrial biopsy. The primary endpoint for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS was the mean change of frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS at weeks four and 12 compared to placebo, as measured by the number and severity of hot flashes. Only subjects experiencing a minimum daily frequency of seven moderate to severe hot flashes at screening were included in the VMS analysis, while all subjects were included in the endometrial hyperplasia analysis. The secondary endpoints included reduction in sleep disturbances and improvement in quality of life measures, night sweats and vaginal dryness, measured at 12 weeks, six months and 12 months. The trial evaluated 1,835 patients between 40 and 65 years old at 111 sites. On December 5, 2016, we announced positive topline data for the REPLENISH Trial.\nThe REPLENISH Trial evaluated four doses of TX-001HR and placebo; the doses studied were:\n \u25cf 17\u00df-estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 416) \n \u25cf 17\u00df-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 423) \n \u25cf 17\u00df-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 421) \n \u25cf 17\u00df-estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 424) \n \u25cf Placebo (n = 151) \nThe REPLENISH Trial results demonstrated:\n\u25cf TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both achieved all four of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and the primary safety endpoint.\n\u25cf TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both the frequency and severity of hot flashes compared to placebo.\n\u25cf TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg were not statistically significant at all of the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg dose was included in the clinical trial as a non-effective dose to meet the recommendation of the FDA guidance to identify the lowest effective dose.\n\u25cf The incidence of consensus endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was 0 percent across all four TX-001HR doses, meeting the recommendations established by the FDA's draft guidance.\nAs outlined in the FDA guidance, the co-primary efficacy endpoints in the REPLENISH Trial were the change from baseline in the number and severity of hot flashes at weeks four and 12 as compared to placebo. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia with up to 12 months of treatment. General safety was also evaluated.\nThe results of the REPLENISH Trial are summarized in the table below (p-values of < 0.05 meet FDA guidance and support evidence of efficacy):\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> Replenish Trial Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints: Mean Change in Frequency and Severity of Hot Flashes Per Week Versus Placebo at Weeks 4 and 12, VMS-MITT Population </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estradiol/Progesterone </td> <td> 1 mg/100 mg </td> <td> 0.5 mg/100 mg </td> <td> 0.5 mg/50 mg </td> <td> 0.25 mg/50 mg </td> <td> Placebo </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> (n = 141) </td> <td> (n = 149) </td> <td> (n = 147) </td> <td> (n = 154) </td> <td> (n = 135) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Frequency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 4 P-value versus placebo </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> 0.013 </td> <td> 0.141 </td> <td> 0.001 </td> <td> - </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 12 P-value versus placebo </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> 0.002 </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> - </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Severity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 4 P-value versus placebo </td> <td> 0.031 </td> <td> 0.005 </td> <td> 0.401 </td> <td> 0.100 </td> <td> - </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 12 P-value versus placebo </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> <0.001 </td> <td> 0.018 </td> <td> 0.096 </td> <td> - </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Replenish Trial Primary Safety Endpoint: Incidence of Consensus Endometrial Hyperplasia or Malignancy up to 12 months, Endometrial Safety Population\u0166 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Endometrial Hyperplasia </td> <td> 0% (0/280) </td> <td> 0% (0/303) </td> <td> 0% (0/306) </td> <td> 0% (0/274) </td> <td> 0% (0/92) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMITT = Modified intent to treat\n\u0166Per FDA, consensus hyperplasia refers to the concurrence of two of the three pathologists be accepted as the final diagnosis\nWe submitted the NDA for TX-001HR with the FDA on December 28, 2017. Assuming that the NDA is accepted 74 days thereafter and an FDA review period of ten months from the receipt date to the PDUFA target action date for a non-new molecular entity, the NDA for TX-001HR could be approved by the FDA as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTX-002HR\nTX-002HR is a natural progesterone formulation for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea without the potentially allergenic component of peanut oil. The hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to - or having the same chemical and molecular structure as - the hormones that naturally occur in a woman's body. We believe it will be similarly effective to traditional treatments, but may demonstrate efficacy at lower dosages. In January 2014, we began recruitment of patients in the SPRY Trial, a phase 3 clinical trial designed to measure the safety and effectiveness of TX-002HR in the treatment of secondary amenorrhea. During the first two quarters of 2014, the SPRY Trial encountered enrollment challenges because of Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approved clinical trial protocols and FDA inclusion and exclusion criteria. In July 2014, we suspended enrollment and in October 2014 we stopped the SPRY Trial in order to update the phase 3 protocol based on discussions with the FDA. Our IND related to TX-002HR is currently in inactive status. We are considering updating the phase 3 protocol to, among other things, target only those women with secondary amenorrhea due to polycystic ovarian syndrome and to amend the primary endpoint of the trial. We believe that the updated phase 3 protocol, if proposed by us and approved by the FDA, would allow us to mitigate the enrollment challenges in, and shorten the duration of, the SPRY Trial. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will approve the updated phase 3 protocol if we propose it. We have currently suspended further development of this drug candidate to prioritize our leading drug candidates.\nTX-003HR\nTX-003HR is a natural estradiol formulation. This hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to the hormones that naturally occur in a woman's body. We currently do not have plans to further develop this hormone therapy drug candidate. Our IND related to TX-003HR is currently inactive.\nTX-004HR\nTX-004HR is our applicator free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA in menopausal women with vaginal linings that do not receive enough estrogen. We believe that our drug candidate will be at least as effective as the traditional treatments for VVA because of an early onset of action with less systemic exposure, and it will have an added advantage of being a more simple, easier to use dosage form versus traditional VVA treatments. We initiated the REJOICE Trial, a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial during the third quarter of 2014 to assess the safety and efficacy of three doses - 25 mcg, 10 mcg and 4 mcg (compared to placebo) - of TX-004HR for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, or painful intercourse, as a symptom of VVA due to menopause.\nOn November 10, 2015, the FDA held a scientific workshop on labeling lower\u201d dose estrogen-alone products for symptoms of VVA to provide an opportunity for the FDA to obtain input from experts on several topics related to the product label of lower dose estrogen-alone products approved solely for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of VVA due to menopause. According to the FDA, lower-dose estrogen products means products that contain less than the 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens used in the WHI study and estradiol products containing 0.0375 mg and below. Discussion topics at the workshop included the relevance of the boxed warnings based on data from the WHI to the lower dose estrogen-alone products; certain members in the scientific/medical community have questioned whether the boxed warnings section in the labeling, which is currently required to be included on all estrogen products, is applicable in whole or in part to these lower-dose estrogen products. The boxed warnings include: (1) an increased risk of endometrial cancer in women with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens, (2) estrogen therapy with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, (3) an increased risk of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in women treated with estrogen-alone, (4) an increased risk of probable dementia in post-menopausal women 65 years of age and older treated with estrogen-alone, (5) an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women treated with estrogen plus progestin, and (6) to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. It is unknown at this time what, if any, changes the FDA may propose with respect to the boxed warnings on lower dose estrogen-alone products for symptoms of VVA or whether such label changes would be applicable to TX-004HR, if approved.\nOn December 7, 2015, we announced positive top-line results from the REJOICE Trial. The pre-specified four co-primary efficacy endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 12 versus placebo in the percentage of vaginal superficial cells, percentage of vaginal parabasal cells, vaginal pH and severity of participants' self-reported moderate to severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom of VVA. The trial enrolled 764 menopausal women (40 to 75 years old) experiencing moderate to severe dyspareunia at approximately 89 sites across the United States and Canada. Trial participants were randomized to receive either TX-004HR at 25 mcg (n=190), 10 mcg (n=191), or 4 mcg (n=191) doses or placebo (n=192) for a total of 12 weeks, all administered once daily for two weeks and then twice weekly (approximately three to four days apart) for ten weeks.\nThe following table sets forth the statistical significance of the REJOICE Trial results for the four pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints, based on mean changes from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo. Based on our analyses of the REJOICE Trial data, statistical significance of the results for the co-primary endpoint of severity of participants' self-reported moderate to severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom of VVA has improved for all three doses from the results originally reported.\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25 mcg </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10 mcg </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4 mcg </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Superficial Cells </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Parabasal Cells </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vaginal pH </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severity of Dyspareunia </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 25 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo across all four co-primary endpoints. The 10 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo across all four co-primary endpoints. The 4 mcg dose of TX-004HR also demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo for the endpoints of vaginal superficial cells, vaginal parabasal cells, and vaginal pH; the change from baseline compared to placebo in the severity of dyspareunia was statistically significant at the p = 0.0149 level. The FDA has previously indicated to us that in order to approve the drug based on a single trial, the trial would need to show statistical significance at the 0.01 level or lower for each endpoint, and that a trial that is merely statistically significant at a higher level may not provide sufficient evidence to support an NDA filing or approval of a drug candidate where the NDA relies on a single clinical trial.\nStatistical improvement over placebo was also observed for all three doses at the first assessment at week two and sustained through week 12 (see table below).\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25 mcg </td> <td> </td> <td> 10 mcg </td> <td> </td> <td> 4 mcg </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 2 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0105 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0019 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.026 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 6 </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0009 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0069 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 8 </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0003 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Week 12 </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> P < 0.0001 </td> <td> </td> <td> P = 0.0149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nVaginal dryness was a prespecified key secondary endpoint.

TX-004HR was well tolerated, and there were no clinically significant differences compared to placebo-treated participants with respect to adverse events. There were no drug-related serious adverse events reported.\nWe submitted the NDA for TX-004HR with the FDA on July 7, 2016. The FDA determined that the NDA was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and accepted the NDA for filing with the PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of May 7, 2017. The NDA submission was supported by the complete TX-004HR clinical program, including positive results of the phase 3 REJOICE Trial. The NDA submission included all three doses of TX-004HR (4 mcg, 10 mcg and 25 mcg) that were evaluated in the REJOICE Trial.\nOn May 5, 2017, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding the NDA for TX-004HR. In the CRL, the only approvability concern raised by the FDA was the lack of long-term safety data for TX-004HR beyond the 12 weeks studied in the phase 3 REJOICE Trial. The CRL did not identify any issues related to the efficacy of TX-004HR and did not identify any approvability issues related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls.\nOn June 14, 2017, we participated in a Type A Post-Action Meeting with the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products (DBRUP) of the FDA to discuss the CRL. At the meeting, we presented information that we believed could address concerns raised by the FDA in the CRL. On July 5, 2017, we received the official minutes of the meeting from the FDA, which provided the FDA's response to the information presented at the Type A meeting. Per the FDA's request, we formally submitted the information presented at the Type A meeting for consideration related to the NDA for TX-004HR.\nOn August 3, 2017, we received a formal General Advice Letter from the FDA stating that an initial review of this information has been completed and requesting that we submit the additional endometrial safety information to the NDA for TX-004HR on or before September 18, 2017. On September 14, 2017, we submitted the additional endometrial safety information that was requested by the FDA in the General Advice Letter to the NDA for TX-004HR. The submission included a comprehensive, systematic review of the medical literature on the use of vaginal estrogen products and the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, including the safety data from the recently published Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, or WHI Study, of vaginal estrogen use in post-menopausal women and information on the relevance of the first uterine pass effect for low-dose vaginal estrogen products. The WHI Study demonstrated no significant difference in the risk of invasive breast cancer, stroke, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolism in vaginal estrogen users versus non-users. The WHI Study also shows that, among women with an intact uterus, there was a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, hip fracture and all-cause mortality in vaginal estrogen users versus non-users. The WHI Study evaluated over 4,000 women who used vaginal estrogens for a median duration of two to three years.\nOn November 3, 2017, we participated in an in-person meeting with DBRUP. At the meeting, DBRUP agreed to the resubmission of the NDA for the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses of TX-004HR without the need for an additional pre-approval study.\nOn November 29, 2017, we resubmitted the NDA for the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses of TX-004HR with the FDA. We have committed to conduct a post-approval observational study. The FDA has acknowledged that the resubmission is a complete, class 2 response to the CRL received on May 5, 2017 for TX-004HR. The PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA's review is May 29, 2018. If approved, the 4 mcg formulation of TX-004HR would represent a lower effective dose than the currently available VVA therapies approved by the FDA.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nA significant portion of our operating expenses to date have been incurred in research and development activities. Research and development expenses relate primarily to the discovery and development of our drug products. Our business model is dependent upon our company continuing to conduct a significant amount of research and development. Other research and development\u201d costs in the table below consist of products costs incurred prior to IND approval from the FDA as well as other clinical and regulatory consulting costs. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, investigative sites, and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical studies; employee-related expenses, which include salaries and benefits, and non-cash share-based compensation; the cost of developing our chemistry, manufacturing and controls capabilities, and acquiring clinical trial materials; and costs associated with other research activities and regulatory approvals.\nWe make payments to the CROs based on agreed upon terms that may include payments in advance of a study starting date. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. Advance payments to be expensed in future research and development activities were $0, $228,933 and $1,138,073, at December 31, 2017, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nThe following table indicates our research and development expense by project for the periods indicated:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(000s) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>TX-001HR </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,227 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>TX-002HR </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>TX-004HR </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,574 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other research and development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,219 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,043 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenditures will continue to be incurred as we continue development of our drug candidates and advance the development of our proprietary pipeline of novel drug candidates. We expect to incur ongoing research and development costs as we develop our drug pipeline, continue stability testing and validation on our drug candidates, prepare regulatory submissions and work with regulatory authorities on existing submissions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in February 2013, we have incurred approximately $19,381,000 and $115,397,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-001HR, our combination estradiol and progesterone drug candidate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in April 2013, we have incurred approximately $0 and $2,525,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-002HR, our progesterone only drug candidate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in August 2014, we have incurred approximately $8,043,000 and $40,849,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-004HR, our vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate.\nThe costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to factors that include, but are not limited to, the following: per patient trial costs; the number of patients that participate in the trials; the number of sites included in the trials; the length of time each patient is enrolled in the trial; the number of doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; the amount of time required to recruit patients for the trial; the duration of patient follow-up; and the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate. We base our expenses related to clinical trials on estimates that are based on our experience and estimates from CROs and other third parties. Research and development expenditures for the drug candidates will continue after the trial completes for on-going stability and laboratory testing, regulatory submission and response work.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with year ended December 31, 2016\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (000s) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 16,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 19,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (2,578 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,548 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 91,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 105,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (13,655 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (77,628 </td> <td> ) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (90,253 </td> <td> ) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,625 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (76,925 </td> <td> ) </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (89,875 </td> <td> ) </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 12,950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue is recorded net of sales discounts, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, customer rebates, coupons and estimated returns.

This decrease was attributable to a decrease in the average net revenue per unit of our products, primarily related to higher coupons in 2017 due to implementation of a new point of sale coupon system, partially offset by a slight increase in the number of units sold.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold decreased by approximately $1,548,000, or 37%, to approximately $2,637,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately $4,185,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to lower distribution costs. Our gross margins was 84% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 78% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the centralization of the distribution channel for both our retail pharmacy distributors and wholesale distributors which, among other things, lowered the cost to package, prepare and deliver our products to customers.\nOperating Expenses\nOur principal operating costs included the following items as a percentage of total operating expenses.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Human resource related costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales and marketing costs, excluding human resource costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product research and development costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees and consulting costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses decreased by approximately $13,655,000, or 13%, to approximately $91,769,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately $105,424,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the following items:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (000s) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development costs </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 33,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 53,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (20,090 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Human resource related costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing, excluding human resource costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional and consulting costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,105 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 91,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> 105,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> (13,655 </td> <td> ) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by approximately $20,090,000, or 37%, to approximately $33,853,000, primarily as a result of a decrease in costs related to our phase 3 clinical trials of TX-001HR and TX-004HR, partially offset by scale-up and manufacturing activities for our phase 3 clinical trials of TX-001HR and TX-004HR and costs related to regulatory submission related to TX-001HR. Research and development costs in 2017 included approximately a $2,400,000 in NDA submission fees related to TX-001HR and a write-off of approximately $1,000,000 of prepaid manufacturing costs.

Business - Pharmaceutical Regulation.\u201d Future milestones, including NDA submission dates, are not easily determinable as such milestones are dependent on various factors related to our clinical trials, including the timing of ongoing patient recruitment efforts to find eligible subjects for the applicable trials.\nHuman resource related costs, including salaries and benefits, increased by approximately $9,633,000, or 64%, to approximately $24,599,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $14,966,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of an increase of approximately $3,492,000 in personnel costs in sales, marketing and regulatory areas to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates and an increase in non-cash compensation expense included in this category of approximately $6,141,000 related to employee stock option amortization during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nSales and marketing costs increased approximately $6,833,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 115%, to approximately $12,753,000, compared with approximately $5,920,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increased expenses associated with sales and marketing efforts to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates coupled with an increase in employee incentives.\nProfessional and consulting costs increased approximately $1,652,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 45%, to approximately $5,301,000 compared with approximately $3,649,000 for the year December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increased legal, consulting, accounting expenses.\nAll other costs increased approximately $4,579,000, or 108%, to approximately $8,828,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $4,249,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of a write-off of accounts receivable balances of approximately $2,200,000, increased insurance, rent, information technology and other office expenses.\nOperating Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, our operating loss increased approximately $5,063,000, or 6%, to approximately $90,253,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $85,190,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increased personnel costs, sales and marketing expenses to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates, coupled with a write-off of accounts receivable balances mentioned above and an increase in non-cash compensation expense, professional fees and other operating expenses as well a decrease in revenue, partially offset by a decrease in research and development costs.\nAs a result of the continued development of our hormone therapy drug candidates, we anticipate that we will continue to have operating losses for the near future until our hormone therapy drug candidates are approved by the FDA and brought to market, although there is no assurance that we will attain such approvals or that any marketing of our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, will be successful.\nOther Income\nOther non-operating income increased by approximately $265,000, or 235%, to approximately $378,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with approximately $113,000 for the comparable period in 2015, primarily as a result of increased interest income.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the net effects of the foregoing, net loss increased approximately $4,798,000, or 6%, to approximately $89,875,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $85,077,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loss per share of common stock, basic and diluted, was ($0.46) for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with ($0.49) per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have funded our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock and private placements of equity and debt securities. For the three-year period ending December 31, 2017, we received approximately $294,811,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we had a cash balance of approximately $127,136,000, however, changing circumstances may cause us to consume funds significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control.\nOn September 25, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC relating to an underwritten public offering of 12,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.55 per share. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $68,573,000, after deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us. The offering closed on September 28, 2017 and we issued 12,400,000 shares of our common stock. We intend to use a majority of the net proceeds from this offering to fund pre-commercialization and commercialization activities for our TX-004HR and TX-001HR drug candidates. We currently intend to fund the next phase of our pre-commercialization and commercialization expenses for our TX-004HR and TX-001HR drug candidates through debt financing and are currently engaged in discussions to secure debt financing commitments. If we are successful in obtaining these commitments, we currently anticipate we would begin to draw on them following approval of either TX-004HR or TX-001HR.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, our days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 97 days compared to 92 days for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in our DSO as of December 31, 2017 was partially related to implementation of a new point of sale coupon system which lowered our revenues, as well as to the timing of payments received from our customers subsequent to December 31, 2017. We anticipate that our DSO will fluctuate in the future based upon a variety of factors, including longer payment terms associated with the centralization of the distribution channel for both our retail pharmacy distributors and wholesale distributors, as compared to the terms previously provided to our retail pharmacy distributors, changes in the healthcare industry and specific terms that may be extended in connection with the launch of our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved.\nWe believe that our existing cash will allow us to fund our operating plan through at least the next 12 months from the date of this Annual Report. However, if the commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates is delayed, our existing cash may be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements until we are able to commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates. If our available cash is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may curtail our sales, marketing and other pre-commercialization efforts and we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing shareholders. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or proposed products. Additionally, we may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe need substantial amounts of cash to complete the clinical development of and commercialize of our hormone therapy drug candidates. The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below:\nSummary of (Uses) and Sources of Cash\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash flows used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(76,155,614 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(69,142,333 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(79,044,199 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash flows used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(827,108 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,255,456 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(584,361 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash flows provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,584,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,225,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,973,228 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe principal use of cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was to fund our current expenses primarily related to supporting clinical development, scale-up and manufacturing activities and future commercial activities, adjusted for non-cash items. The increase of approximately $7,013,000 in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to changes in the components of working capital and lower non-cash compensation expense, as well as a decrease in net loss.\nThe decrease of approximately $9,902,000 in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to an increase in our net loss adjusted for non-cash compensation expense and changes in the components of working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease of approximately $428,000 in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in patent costs and costs relating to the purchase of fixed assets.\nThe increase of approximately $671,000 in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in patent costs and the increase in costs relating to the purchase of fixed assets.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities represent the principal source of our cash flow. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 provided net cash of approximately $72,584,000. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 included approximately $68,573,000 in proceeds from sale of our common stock and approximately $4,011,000 in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants.\nOn September 25, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC relating to an underwritten public offering of 12,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.55 per share. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $68,573,000, after deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us. The offering closed on September 28, 2017 and we issued 12,400,000 shares of our common stock.\nOur financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 provided net cash of approximately $137,226,000. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 included approximately $134,864,000 in proceeds from sale of our common stock and approximately $2,362,000 in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants.\nOn January 6, 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Cowen and Company, LLC, as the representatives of the several underwriters, or Underwriters, relating to an underwritten public offering of 15,151,515 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.25 per share. Under the terms of the underwriting agreement, we granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,272,727 additional shares of common stock, which option was exercised in full. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $134,864,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. The offering closed on January 12, 2016 and we issued 17,424,242 shares of our common stock.\nOur financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 provided net cash of approximately $92,973,000. The cash provided by financing activities included approximately $91,375,000 in proceeds from sale of our common stock and approximately $1,598,000 in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants.\nOn July 9, 2015, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and Guggenheim Securities, LLC, as the representatives of the several underwriters, or the Stifel Underwriters, relating to an underwritten public offering of 3,846,154 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.80 per share. Under the terms of the underwriting agreement, we granted the Stifel Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 576,923 additional shares of our common stock, which option was exercised in full. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $32,257,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expense payable by us. The offering closed on July 15, 2015 and we issued 4,423,077 shares of our common stock.\nOn February 10, 2015, we entered into an underwriting agreement, or the Cowen Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, as the representative of the several underwriters, or the Cowen Underwriters, relating to an underwritten public offering of 13,580,246 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $4.05 per share. Under the terms of the Cowen Agreement, we granted the Cowen Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,037,036 additional shares of our common stock, which option was exercised in full. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $59,118,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expense payable by us. The offering closed February 17, 2015 and we issued 15,617,282 shares of our common stock.\nCritical Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n \u25cf it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and \n \u25cf changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. \nWe base our estimates and judgments on our experience, our current knowledge, our beliefs of what could occur in the future, our observation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties: share-based compensation expense and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue on arrangements in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nPrescription Products\nWe sell our name brand and generic prescription products primarily through wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy distributors. We recognize revenue from prescription product sales, net of sales discounts, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, customer rebates, coupons and estimated returns.\nRevenue related to prescription products sold through wholesale distributors is recognized when the prescription products are shipped to the distributors and the control of the products passes to each distributor. We accept returns of unsalable prescription products sold through wholesale distributors within a return period of six months prior to and up to 12 months following product expiration. Our prescription products currently have a shelf life of 24 months from the date of manufacture.\nPrior to September 1, 2016, we recognized revenue related to prescription products sold through retail pharmacy distributors when the product was dispensed by the retail pharmacy distributor, at which point all revenue and discounts related to such product were known or determinable and there was no right of return with respect to such product. On September 1, 2016, we centralized the distribution channel for both our retail pharmacy distributors and wholesale distributors, in order to facilitate sales to a broader population of retail pharmacies and mitigate exposure to any one retail pharmacy. Beginning on September 1, 2016, all of our prescription products are distributed under the wholesale distributor model described above.\nWe offer various rebate programs in an effort to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace and to promote sales and customer loyalty. We estimate the allowance for consumer rebates and coupons that we have offered based on our experience and industry averages, which is reviewed, and adjusted if necessary, on a quarterly basis. We record distributor fees based on amounts stated in contracts and estimate chargebacks based on the number of units sold each period.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development, or R&D, expenses include internal R&D activities, services of external contract research organizations, or CROs, costs of their clinical research sites, manufacturing, scale-up and validation costs, and other activities. Internal R&D activity expenses include laboratory supplies, salaries, benefits, and non-cash share-based compensation expenses. Advance payments to be expensed in future research and development activities are capitalized, and were $0 and $228,933 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, all of which was included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. CRO activity expenses include preclinical laboratory experiments and clinical trial studies. Other activity expenses include regulatory consulting and legal fees and costs. The activities undertaken by our regulatory consultants that were classified as R&D expenses include assisting, consulting with, and advising our in-house staff with respect to various FDA submission processes, clinical trial processes, and scientific writing matters, including preparing protocols and FDA submissions. Legal activities that were classified as R&D expenses include professional research and advice regarding R&D, patents and regulatory matters. These consulting and legal expenses were direct costs associated with preparing, reviewing, and undertaking work for our clinical trials and investigative drugs. We charge internal R&D activities and other activity expenses to operations as incurred. We make payments to CROs based on agreed-upon terms, which may include payments in advance of a study starting date. We expense nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future R&D activities when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. We review and accrue CRO expenses and clinical trial study expenses based on services performed and rely on estimates of those costs applicable to the completion stage of a study as provided by CROs. Estimated accrued CRO costs are subject to revisions as such studies progress to completion. We charge revisions expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nShare-Based Compensation. We measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements may include options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance-based awards, and share appreciation rights. We amortize such compensation amounts, if any, over the respective service periods of the award. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, or the Black-Scholes Model, an acceptable model in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to value options. Option valuation models require the input of assumptions, including the expected life of the stock-based awards, the estimated stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term of the instrument. Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the term of the award. Prior to January 1, 2017, the expected volatility of share options was estimated based on a historical volatility analysis of peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available that were similar to our company with respect to industry, stage of life cycle, market capitalization, and financial leverage. On January 1, 2017, we began using our own stock price in our volatility calculation along with two other peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available that were similar to our company. Our calculation of estimated volatility is based on historical stock prices over a period equal to the expected term of the awards. The average expected life of warrants is based on the contractual terms of the awards. The average expected life of options is based on the contractual terms of the stock option using the simplified method. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. Calculating share-based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions, estimates of expected life of the share-based award, stock price volatility and risk-free interest rates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nEquity instruments ( instruments\u201d) issued to non-employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by ASC 505, Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees, or ASC 505. ASC 505 defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is when either (a) a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The estimated expense is recognized each period based on the current fair value of the award. As a result, the amount of expense related to awards to non-employees can fluctuate significantly during the period from the date of the grant through the final measurement date. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in ASC 505. We recognize the compensation expense for all share-based compensation granted based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with ASC 718. We generally recognize the compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period. We adopted ASU 2016-09, effective January 1, 2017, electing to account for forfeitures when they occur. Prior to that, we estimated the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience of forfeitures.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates when the rate change is enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nIn accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, we recognize the effect of uncertain income tax positions only if the positions are more likely than not of being sustained in an audit, based on the technical merits of the position. We measure recognized uncertain income tax positions using the largest amount that has a likelihood of being realized that is greater than 50%. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which those changes in judgment occur. We recognize both interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no tax positions relating to open tax returns that were considered to be uncertain. Our tax returns are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service three years after they are filed. Currently, years filed after 2013 are subject to review.\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In spite of our belief that we have appropriate support for all the positions taken on our tax returns, we acknowledge that certain positions may be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities. We determine the tax benefits more likely than not to be recognized with respect to uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and inherent uncertainty; therefore, our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely on estimates and assumptions. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, the final determination could be materially different than that which is reflected in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. federal tax code, including, but not limited to reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we have recorded a decrease related to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $49,500,000 and approximately $2,800,000, respectively, with a corresponding net adjustment to the valuation allowance of approximately $46,700,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Act modifies Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, by (1) expanding which employees are considered covered employees by including the chief financial officer, (2) providing that if an individual is a covered employee for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, the individual remains a covered employee for all future years, and (3) removing the exceptions for compensation stemming from contracts entered into on or before November 2, 2017, unless such contracts were materially modified on or after the date. Compensation agreements entered into and share-based payment awards granted after this date will be subject to the revised terms of IRC Section 162(m). In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting for share-based compensation arrangements under the Tax Act to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We must assess whether our valuation allowance analyses are affected by various aspects of the Tax Act. Since, as discussed herein, we have recorded provisional amounts related to certain portions of the Tax Act, any corresponding determination of the need for or change in a valuation allowance is also provisional.\nSegment Reporting. We are managed and operated as one business, which is focused on creating and commercializing products targeted exclusively for women. Our business operations are managed by a single management team that reports to the President of our Company. We do not operate separate lines of business with respect to any of our products and we do not prepare discrete financial information with respect to separate products. All product sales are derived from sales in the United States. Accordingly, we view our business as one reportable operating segment.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements . In May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-09 that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The new guidance will reduce diversity in practice and result in fewer changes to the terms of an award being accounted for as modifications. The new guidance will allow companies to make certain changes to awards without accounting for them as modifications. This guidance does not change the accounting for modifications. The guidance will be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period. We adopted this guidance and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application. We adopted this guidance and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017, electing to account for forfeitures when they occur. The impact from adoption of the provisions related to forfeiture rates was reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a modified retrospective basis, resulting in an adjustment of approximately $31,000 to retained earnings. The impact from adoption of the provisions related to excess tax benefits or deficiencies in the provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital was adopted on a modified retrospective basis. Since we have a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, an amount equal to the cumulative adjustment made to retained earnings to recognize the previously unrecognized net operating losses from prior periods was made to the valuation allowance through retained earnings for the first quarter financial statements. Adoption of all other changes did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This guidance requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. The guidance also eliminates current real estate-specific provisions for all entities. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The standard is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. We are in the process of analyzing the quantitative impact of this guidance on our results of operations and financial position. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe the impact of this standard will be primarily related to the accounting for our operating lease.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under previous guidance. This may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB approved the proposal to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 standard by one year. Early adoption is permitted after December 15, 2016, and the standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. In 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify the implementation guidance for principal versus agent considerations (ASU 2016-08), accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations (ASU 2016-10), narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients (ASU 2016-12) and technical corrections and improvements to topic 606 (ASU 2016-20) in its new revenue standard. We have performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and are monitoring the activity of the FASB and the transition resource group as it relates to specific interpretive guidance. We have reviewed customer contracts and applied the five-step model of the new standard to our contracts as well as compared the results to our current accounting practices. We are currently in the process of drafting disclosures required by the new standard. At this point of our analysis, we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements but will potentially expand our disclosures related to contracts with customers.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions, which, in our judgment, are normal and customary for companies in our industry sector. These agreements are typically with business partners, clinical sites, and suppliers. Pursuant to these agreements, we generally agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to our drug candidates, use of such drug candidates, or other actions taken or omitted by us. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. We have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nIn the normal course of business, we may be confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits, claims, environmental actions or the actions of various regulatory agencies. We consult with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim. If, in our opinion, we have incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in our financial statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nFor each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 is as follows:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Lease Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,101,506 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>951,194 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,207,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>943,127 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently involved in any legal proceeding that we believe would have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEmployment Agreements\nWe have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executives that provide for compensation and certain other benefits. Under certain circumstances, including a change in control, some of these agreements provide for severance or other payments, if those circumstances occur during the term of the employment agreement.\nSeasonality\nThe specialty pharmaceutical industry component of women's health is not subject to seasonal sales fluctuation.\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>",

Currently, we are focused on pursuing the regulatory approvals and pre-commercialization activities necessary for commercialization of our advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products. Our drug candidates that have completed clinical trials are designed to alleviate the symptoms of and reduce the health risks resulting from menopause-related hormone deficiencies, including hot flashes, and vaginal discomfort. We are developing these hormone therapy drug candidates, which contain estradiol and progesterone alone or in combination, with the aim of demonstrating clinical efficacy at lower doses, thereby enabling an enhanced side effect profile compared with competing products. With our SYMBODA\u2122 technology, we are developing advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products to enable delivery of bio-identical hormones through a variety of dosage forms and administration routes. In addition, we manufacture and distribute branded and generic prescription prenatal vitamins.\nResearch and Development - Overview\nWe have submitted two new drug applications, or NDAs, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our hormone therapy drug candidates. In December 2017, we submitted the NDA for TX-001HR, our bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17\u00df- estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel drug candidate, for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, or VMS, due to menopause in menopausal women with an intact uterus. In November 2017, we re-submitted our NDA for TX-004HR, our applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia (vaginal pain during sexual intercourse), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, or VVA, in menopausal women with vaginal linings that do not receive enough estrogen. The NDA for our TX-004HR drug candidate has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of May 29, 2018, and if approved on that date, the drug candidate could be launched as early as the third quarter of 2018. If the NDA for our TX-001HR drug candidate is accepted by the FDA, it could be approved as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018 and launched in 2019.\nTX-001HR\nTX-001HR is our bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17\u00df- estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause, including hot flashes, night sweats and sleep disturbances in menopausal women with an intact uterus. The hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to, or having the same chemical and molecular structure as, the hormones that naturally occur in a woman's body, namely estradiol and progesterone, and is being studied as a continuous-combined regimen, in which the combination of estrogen and progesterone are taken together in one product daily. If approved by the FDA, we believe this would represent the first time a combination product of estradiol and progesterone bioidentical to the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries would be approved for use in a single combined product.\nWe previously conducted a pharmacokinetics, or PK, study of TX-001HR to demonstrate that our drug candidate is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug based on the criterion that the 90% confidence interval on the test-to-reference ratio is contained entirely within the interval 80% to 125%. The study compared our combined capsule TX-001HR of 2 mg estradiol and 200 mg of progesterone to 2 mg of Estrace\u00ae and 200 mg of Prometrium\u00ae.\nThe study compared the mean plasma concentrations for free estradiol between TX-001HR and Estrace\u00ae in 62 female test subjects. When the results of a single dose-fed study were compared over 48 hours by the test drug versus reference drug, the ratio was 0.93 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.409 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.089. The maximum plasma concentration levels of free estradiol showed that the drug -versus -reference drug ratio was 0.88 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.344 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.040 over 48 hours.\nThe study also compared the mean plasma concentrations for progesterone between TX-001HR and Prometrium\u00ae in 62 female test subjects. When the results were compared over 48 hours of the test that the drug-versus-reference drug, the ratio was 1.05 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.956 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.542. The maximum plasma concentration levels of progesterone showed drug versus reference drug ratio as 1.16 with the standard deviation within the subject being 1.179 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.785 over 48 hours.\nOn September 5, 2013, we began enrollment in the REPLENISH Trial, a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial of TX-001HR in menopausal women with an intact uterus. The trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of TX-001HR for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause and the endometrial safety of TX-001HR. Patients were assigned to one of five arms, four active and one placebo, and received study medication for 12 months. The primary endpoint for the reduction of endometrial hyperplasia was an incidence of endometrial hyperplasia of less than 1% at 12 months, as determined by endometrial biopsy. The primary endpoint for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS was the mean change of frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS at weeks four and 12 compared to placebo, as measured by the number and severity of hot flashes. Only subjects experiencing a minimum daily frequency of seven moderate to severe hot flashes at screening were included in the VMS analysis, while all subjects were included in the endometrial hyperplasia analysis. The secondary endpoints included reduction in sleep disturbances and improvement in quality of life measures, night sweats and vaginal dryness, measured at 12 weeks, six months and 12 months. The trial evaluated 1,835 patients between 40 and 65 years old at 111 sites. On December 5, 2016, we announced positive topline data for the REPLENISH Trial.\nThe REPLENISH Trial evaluated four doses of TX-001HR and placebo; the doses studied were:\n \u25cf 17\u00df-estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 416) \n \u25cf 17\u00df-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 423) \n \u25cf 17\u00df-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 421) \n \u25cf 17\u00df-estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 424) \n \u25cf Placebo (n = 151) \nThe REPLENISH Trial results demonstrated:\n\u25cf TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both achieved all four of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and the primary safety endpoint.\n\u25cf TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both the frequency and severity of hot flashes compared to placebo.\n\u25cf TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg were not statistically significant at all of the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg dose was included in the clinical trial as a non-effective dose to meet the recommendation of the FDA guidance to identify the lowest effective dose.\n\u25cf The incidence of consensus endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was 0 percent across all four TX-001HR doses, meeting the recommendations established by the FDA's draft guidance.\nAs outlined in the FDA guidance, the co-primary efficacy endpoints in the REPLENISH Trial were the change from baseline in the number and severity of hot flashes at weeks four and 12 as compared to placebo. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia with up to 12 months of treatment. General safety was also evaluated.\nThe results of the REPLENISH Trial are summarized in the table below (p-values of < 0.05 meet FDA guidance and support evidence of efficacy):\n\nMITT = Modified intent to treat\n\u0166Per FDA, consensus hyperplasia refers to the concurrence of two of the three pathologists be accepted as the final diagnosis\nWe submitted the NDA for TX-001HR with the FDA on December 28, 2017. Assuming that the NDA is accepted 74 days thereafter and an FDA review period of ten months from the receipt date to the PDUFA target action date for a non-new molecular entity, the NDA for TX-001HR could be approved by the FDA as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTX-002HR\nTX-002HR is a natural progesterone formulation for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea without the potentially allergenic component of peanut oil. The hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to - or having the same chemical and molecular structure as - the hormones that naturally occur in a woman's body. We believe it will be similarly effective to traditional treatments, but may demonstrate efficacy at lower dosages. In January 2014, we began recruitment of patients in the SPRY Trial, a phase 3 clinical trial designed to measure the safety and effectiveness of TX-002HR in the treatment of secondary amenorrhea. During the first two quarters of 2014, the SPRY Trial encountered enrollment challenges because of Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approved clinical trial protocols and FDA inclusion and exclusion criteria. In July 2014, we suspended enrollment and in October 2014 we stopped the SPRY Trial in order to update the phase 3 protocol based on discussions with the FDA. Our IND related to TX-002HR is currently in inactive status. We are considering updating the phase 3 protocol to, among other things, target only those women with secondary amenorrhea due to polycystic ovarian syndrome and to amend the primary endpoint of the trial. We believe that the updated phase 3 protocol, if proposed by us and approved by the FDA, would allow us to mitigate the enrollment challenges in, and shorten the duration of, the SPRY Trial. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will approve the updated phase 3 protocol if we propose it. We have currently suspended further development of this drug candidate to prioritize our leading drug candidates.\nTX-003HR\nTX-003HR is a natural estradiol formulation. This hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to the hormones that naturally occur in a woman's body. We currently do not have plans to further develop this hormone therapy drug candidate. Our IND related to TX-003HR is currently inactive.\nTX-004HR\nTX-004HR is our applicator free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA in menopausal women with vaginal linings that do not receive enough estrogen. We believe that our drug candidate will be at least as effective as the traditional treatments for VVA because of an early onset of action with less systemic exposure, and it will have an added advantage of being a more simple, easier to use dosage form versus traditional VVA treatments. We initiated the REJOICE Trial, a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial during the third quarter of 2014 to assess the safety and efficacy of three doses - 25 mcg, 10 mcg and 4 mcg (compared to placebo) - of TX-004HR for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, or painful intercourse, as a symptom of VVA due to menopause.\nOn November 10, 2015, the FDA held a scientific workshop on labeling lower\u201d dose estrogen-alone products for symptoms of VVA to provide an opportunity for the FDA to obtain input from experts on several topics related to the product label of lower dose estrogen-alone products approved solely for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of VVA due to menopause. According to the FDA, lower-dose estrogen products means products that contain less than the 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens used in the WHI study and estradiol products containing 0.0375 mg and below. Discussion topics at the workshop included the relevance of the boxed warnings based on data from the WHI to the lower dose estrogen-alone products; certain members in the scientific/medical community have questioned whether the boxed warnings section in the labeling, which is currently required to be included on all estrogen products, is applicable in whole or in part to these lower-dose estrogen products. The boxed warnings include: (1) an increased risk of endometrial cancer in women with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens, (2) estrogen therapy with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, (3) an increased risk of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in women treated with estrogen-alone, (4) an increased risk of probable dementia in post-menopausal women 65 years of age and older treated with estrogen-alone, (5) an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women treated with estrogen plus progestin, and (6) to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. It is unknown at this time what, if any, changes the FDA may propose with respect to the boxed warnings on lower dose estrogen-alone products for symptoms of VVA or whether such label changes would be applicable to TX-004HR, if approved.\nOn December 7, 2015, we announced positive top-line results from the REJOICE Trial. The pre-specified four co-primary efficacy endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 12 versus placebo in the percentage of vaginal superficial cells, percentage of vaginal parabasal cells, vaginal pH and severity of participants' self-reported moderate to severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom of VVA. The trial enrolled 764 menopausal women (40 to 75 years old) experiencing moderate to severe dyspareunia at approximately 89 sites across the United States and Canada. Trial participants were randomized to receive either TX-004HR at 25 mcg (n=190), 10 mcg (n=191), or 4 mcg (n=191) doses or placebo (n=192) for a total of 12 weeks, all administered once daily for two weeks and then twice weekly (approximately three to four days apart) for ten weeks.\nThe following table sets forth the statistical significance of the REJOICE Trial results for the four pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints, based on mean changes from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo. Based on our analyses of the REJOICE Trial data, statistical significance of the results for the co-primary endpoint of severity of participants' self-reported moderate to severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom of VVA has improved for all three doses from the results originally reported.\n\nThe 25 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo across all four co-primary endpoints. The 10 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo across all four co-primary endpoints. The 4 mcg dose of TX-004HR also demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo for the endpoints of vaginal superficial cells, vaginal parabasal cells, and vaginal pH; the change from baseline compared to placebo in the severity of dyspareunia was statistically significant at the p = 0.0149 level. The FDA has previously indicated to us that in order to approve the drug based on a single trial, the trial would need to show statistical significance at the 0.01 level or lower for each endpoint, and that a trial that is merely statistically significant at a higher level may not provide sufficient evidence to support an NDA filing or approval of a drug candidate where the NDA relies on a single clinical trial.\nStatistical improvement over placebo was also observed for all three doses at the first assessment at week two and sustained through week 12 (see table below).\n\nVaginal dryness was a prespecified key secondary endpoint. The 25 mcg and 10 mcg doses of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo for the endpoint of vaginal dryness. The 4 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated statistically significant results at the p = 0.0014 level compared to placebo (see table below).\n\nThe pharmacokinetic data for all three doses demonstrated negligible to very low systemic absorption of 17 beta estradiol, estrone and estrone conjugated, supporting the previous phase 1 trial data. TX-004HR was well tolerated, and there were no clinically significant differences compared to placebo-treated participants with respect to adverse events. There were no drug-related serious adverse events reported.\nWe submitted the NDA for TX-004HR with the FDA on July 7, 2016. The FDA determined that the NDA was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and accepted the NDA for filing with the PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of May 7, 2017. The NDA submission was supported by the complete TX-004HR clinical program, including positive results of the phase 3 REJOICE Trial. The NDA submission included all three doses of TX-004HR (4 mcg, 10 mcg and 25 mcg) that were evaluated in the REJOICE Trial.\nOn May 5, 2017, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding the NDA for TX-004HR. In the CRL, the only approvability concern raised by the FDA was the lack of long-term safety data for TX-004HR beyond the 12 weeks studied in the phase 3 REJOICE Trial. The CRL did not identify any issues related to the efficacy of TX-004HR and did not identify any approvability issues related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls.\nOn June 14, 2017, we participated in a Type A Post-Action Meeting with the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products (DBRUP) of the FDA to discuss the CRL. At the meeting, we presented information that we believed could address concerns raised by the FDA in the CRL. On July 5, 2017, we received the official minutes of the meeting from the FDA, which provided the FDA's response to the information presented at the Type A meeting. Per the FDA's request, we formally submitted the information presented at the Type A meeting for consideration related to the NDA for TX-004HR.\nOn August 3, 2017, we received a formal General Advice Letter from the FDA stating that an initial review of this information has been completed and requesting that we submit the additional endometrial safety information to the NDA for TX-004HR on or before September 18, 2017. On September 14, 2017, we submitted the additional endometrial safety information that was requested by the FDA in the General Advice Letter to the NDA for TX-004HR. The submission included a comprehensive, systematic review of the medical literature on the use of vaginal estrogen products and the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, including the safety data from the recently published Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, or WHI Study, of vaginal estrogen use in post-menopausal women and information on the relevance of the first uterine pass effect for low-dose vaginal estrogen products. The WHI Study demonstrated no significant difference in the risk of invasive breast cancer, stroke, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolism in vaginal estrogen users versus non-users. The WHI Study also shows that, among women with an intact uterus, there was a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, hip fracture and all-cause mortality in vaginal estrogen users versus non-users. The WHI Study evaluated over 4,000 women who used vaginal estrogens for a median duration of two to three years.\nOn November 3, 2017, we participated in an in-person meeting with DBRUP. At the meeting, DBRUP agreed to the resubmission of the NDA for the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses of TX-004HR without the need for an additional pre-approval study.\nOn November 29, 2017, we resubmitted the NDA for the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses of TX-004HR with the FDA. We have committed to conduct a post-approval observational study. The FDA has acknowledged that the resubmission is a complete, class 2 response to the CRL received on May 5, 2017 for TX-004HR. The PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA's review is May 29, 2018. If approved, the 4 mcg formulation of TX-004HR would represent a lower effective dose than the currently available VVA therapies approved by the FDA.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nA significant portion of our operating expenses to date have been incurred in research and development activities. Research and development expenses relate primarily to the discovery and development of our drug products. Our business model is dependent upon our company continuing to conduct a significant amount of research and development. Other research and development\u201d costs in the table below consist of products costs incurred prior to IND approval from the FDA as well as other clinical and regulatory consulting costs. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, investigative sites, and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical studies; employee-related expenses, which include salaries and benefits, and non-cash share-based compensation; the cost of developing our chemistry, manufacturing and controls capabilities, and acquiring clinical trial materials; and costs associated with other research activities and regulatory approvals.\nWe make payments to the CROs based on agreed upon terms that may include payments in advance of a study starting date. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. Advance payments to be expensed in future research and development activities were $0, $228,933 and $1,138,073, at December 31, 2017, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nThe following table indicates our research and development expense by project for the periods indicated:\n\nResearch and development expenditures will continue to be incurred as we continue development of our drug candidates and advance the development of our proprietary pipeline of novel drug candidates. We expect to incur ongoing research and development costs as we develop our drug pipeline, continue stability testing and validation on our drug candidates, prepare regulatory submissions and work with regulatory authorities on existing submissions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in February 2013, we have incurred approximately $19,381,000 and $115,397,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-001HR, our combination estradiol and progesterone drug candidate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in April 2013, we have incurred approximately $0 and $2,525,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-002HR, our progesterone only drug candidate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in August 2014, we have incurred approximately $8,043,000 and $40,849,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-004HR, our vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate.\nThe costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to factors that include, but are not limited to, the following: per patient trial costs; the number of patients that participate in the trials; the number of sites included in the trials; the length of time each patient is enrolled in the trial; the number of doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; the amount of time required to recruit patients for the trial; the duration of patient follow-up; and the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate. We base our expenses related to clinical trials on estimates that are based on our experience and estimates from CROs and other third parties. Research and development expenditures for the drug candidates will continue after the trial completes for on-going stability and laboratory testing, regulatory submission and response work.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with year ended December 31, 2016\n\nRevenue\nRevenue is recorded net of sales discounts, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, customer rebates, coupons and estimated returns. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by approximately $2,578,000, or 13%, to approximately $16,778,000, compared with approximately $19,356,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was attributable to a decrease in the average net revenue per unit of our products, primarily related to higher coupons in 2017 due to implementation of a new point of sale coupon system, partially offset by a slight increase in the number of units sold.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold decreased by approximately $1,548,000, or 37%, to approximately $2,637,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately $4,185,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to lower distribution costs. Our gross margins was 84% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 78% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the centralization of the distribution channel for both our retail pharmacy distributors and wholesale distributors which, among other things, lowered the cost to package, prepare and deliver our products to customers.\nOperating Expenses\nOur principal operating costs included the following items as a percentage of total operating expenses.\n\nOperating expenses decreased by approximately $13,655,000, or 13%, to approximately $91,769,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately $105,424,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the following items:\n\nResearch and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by approximately $20,090,000, or 37%, to approximately $33,853,000, primarily as a result of a decrease in costs related to our phase 3 clinical trials of TX-001HR and TX-004HR, partially offset by scale-up and manufacturing activities for our phase 3 clinical trials of TX-001HR and TX-004HR and costs related to regulatory submission related to TX-001HR. Research and development costs in 2017 included approximately a $2,400,000 in NDA submission fees related to TX-001HR and a write-off of approximately $1,000,000 of prepaid manufacturing costs. Research and developments costs during the year ended December 31, 2017 included the following research and development projects:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in February 2013, we have incurred approximately $19,381,000 and $115,397,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-001HR, our combination estradiol and progesterone drug candidate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in April 2013, we have incurred approximately $0 and 2,525,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-002HR, our progesterone only drug candidate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the project's inception in August 2014, we have incurred approximately $8,043,000 and $40,849,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-004HR, our vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate.\nFor a discussion of the nature of efforts and steps necessary to complete these projects, see Item 1. Business - Research and Development.\u201d For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of our products, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.\u201d For a discussion of the extent and nature of additional resources that we may need to obtain if our current liquidity is not expected to be sufficient to complete these projects, see - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d For a discussion as to whether a future milestone such as completion of a development phase, date of filing an NDA with a regulatory agency or approval from a regulatory agency can be reliably determined, see Item 1. Business - Our Hormone Therapy Drug Candidates,\u201d Item 1. Business - Products in Development\u201d and Item 1. Business - Pharmaceutical Regulation.\u201d Future milestones, including NDA submission dates, are not easily determinable as such milestones are dependent on various factors related to our clinical trials, including the timing of ongoing patient recruitment efforts to find eligible subjects for the applicable trials.\nHuman resource related costs, including salaries and benefits, increased by approximately $121,000, or 0.5%, to approximately $24,720,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately $24,599,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of an increase of approximately $5,750,000 in personnel costs in sales, marketing and regulatory areas to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash compensation expense included in this category of approximately $5,629,000 related to employee stock option amortization during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nSales and marketing costs increased by approximately $6,861,000, or 54%, to approximately $19,614,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately $12,753,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of increased expenses in the first half of 2017 associated with sales and marketing efforts to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates, which were curtailed in the third quarter of 2017 due to the status of the NDA for TX-004HR, higher costs related to outsourced sales personnel and their related expenses which started in the fourth quarter of 2016, together with an increase in employee incentives.\nProfessional and consulting costs increased by approximately $558,000, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, to approximately $5,859,000 compared with approximately $5,301,000 for the year December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of result of increased legal and other professional expenses, partially offset by a decrease in consulting and accounting expenses.\nAll other costs decreased by approximately $1,105,000, or 13%, to approximately $7,723,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately $8,828,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of a decrease in write-off of accounts receivable balances of approximately $2,200,000, which occurred in 2016, partially offset by an increase in rent, information technology, insurance, and other office expenses in 2017.\nOperating Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, our operating loss decreased approximately $12,625,000, or 14%, to approximately $77,628,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately $90,253,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of decreased research and development expenses, non-cash compensation expense and other expenses, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses associated with sales and marketing efforts to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates and higher personnel costs.\nAs a result of the continued development of our hormone therapy drug candidates, we anticipate that we will continue to have operating losses for the near future until our hormone therapy drug candidates are approved by the FDA and brought to market, although there is no assurance that we will attain such approvals or that any marketing of our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, will be successful.\nOther Income\nOther non-operating income increased by approximately $325,000, or 86%, to approximately $703,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with approximately $378,000 for the comparable period in 2016, primarily as a result of increased interest income.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the net effects of the foregoing, net loss decreased approximately $12,950,000, or 14%, to approximately $76,925,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with approximately $89,875,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net loss per share of common stock, basic and diluted, was ($0.37) for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with ($0.46) per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2015\n\nRevenue\nRevenue is recorded net of sales discounts, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, customer rebates, coupons and estimated returns. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by approximately $787,000, or 4%, to approximately $19,356,000, compared with approximately $20,143,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average net revenue per unit of our products primarily related to higher estimates related to discounts and returns in 2016, and the reversal of the deferred revenue balance in the first quarter of 2015 related to products sold through wholesale distributors until the right of return no longer existed, partially offset by an increase in the number of units sold.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold decreased by approximately $321,000, or 7%, to approximately $4,185,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $4,506,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to lower distribution costs and more favorable product mix of our products sold, partially offset by the reversal of the deferred balance in the first quarter of 2015 related to products sold through wholesale distributors until the right of return no longer existed. Our gross margins of 78% for the year ended December 31, 2016 remained unchanged from the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nOur principal operating costs included the following items as a percentage of total operating expenses.\n\nOperating expenses increased by approximately $4,597,000, or 5%, to approximately $105,424,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $100,827,000 for year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of the following items:\n\nResearch and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by approximately $18,100,000, or 25%, to approximately $53,943,000, primarily as a result of a decrease in costs related to our phase 3 clinical trials of TX-001HR and TX-004HR, partially offset by scale-up and manufacturing activities for our phase 3 clinical trials of TX-001HR and TX-004HR and costs related to regulatory submission related to TX-004HR. Research and developments costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 included the following research and development projects:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and since the project's inception in February 2013, we have incurred approximately $31,857,000 and $96,016,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-001HR, our combination estradiol and progesterone drug candidate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and since the project's inception in April 2013, we have incurred approximately $0 and $2,525,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-002HR, our progesterone only drug candidate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 and since the project's inception in August 2014, we have incurred approximately $9,248,000 and $32,806,000, respectively, in research and development costs with respect to TX-004HR, our vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate.\nFor a discussion of the nature of efforts and steps necessary to complete these projects, see Item 1. Business - Research and Development.\u201d For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of our products, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.\u201d For a discussion of the extent and nature of additional resources that we may need to obtain if our current liquidity is not expected to be sufficient to complete these projects, see - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d For a discussion as to whether a future milestone such as completion of a development phase, date of filing an NDA with a regulatory agency or approval from a regulatory agency can be reliably determined, see Item 1. Business - Our Hormone Therapy Drug Candidates,\u201d Item 1. Business - Products in Development\u201d and Item 1. Business - Pharmaceutical Regulation.\u201d Future milestones, including NDA submission dates, are not easily determinable as such milestones are dependent on various factors related to our clinical trials, including the timing of ongoing patient recruitment efforts to find eligible subjects for the applicable trials.\nHuman resource related costs, including salaries and benefits, increased by approximately $9,633,000, or 64%, to approximately $24,599,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $14,966,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of an increase of approximately $3,492,000 in personnel costs in sales, marketing and regulatory areas to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates and an increase in non-cash compensation expense included in this category of approximately $6,141,000 related to employee stock option amortization during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nSales and marketing costs increased approximately $6,833,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 115%, to approximately $12,753,000, compared with approximately $5,920,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increased expenses associated with sales and marketing efforts to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates coupled with an increase in employee incentives.\nProfessional and consulting costs increased approximately $1,652,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 45%, to approximately $5,301,000 compared with approximately $3,649,000 for the year December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increased legal, consulting, accounting expenses.\nAll other costs increased approximately $4,579,000, or 108%, to approximately $8,828,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $4,249,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of a write-off of accounts receivable balances of approximately $2,200,000, increased insurance, rent, information technology and other office expenses.\nOperating Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, our operating loss increased approximately $5,063,000, or 6%, to approximately $90,253,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $85,190,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increased personnel costs, sales and marketing expenses to support commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates, coupled with a write-off of accounts receivable balances mentioned above and an increase in non-cash compensation expense, professional fees and other operating expenses as well a decrease in revenue, partially offset by a decrease in research and development costs.\nAs a result of the continued development of our hormone therapy drug candidates, we anticipate that we will continue to have operating losses for the near future until our hormone therapy drug candidates are approved by the FDA and brought to market, although there is no assurance that we will attain such approvals or that any marketing of our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, will be successful.\nOther Income\nOther non-operating income increased by approximately $265,000, or 235%, to approximately $378,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with approximately $113,000 for the comparable period in 2015, primarily as a result of increased interest income.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the net effects of the foregoing, net loss increased approximately $4,798,000, or 6%, to approximately $89,875,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with approximately $85,077,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loss per share of common stock, basic and diluted, was ($0.46) for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with ($0.49) per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have funded our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock and private placements of equity and debt securities. For the three-year period ending December 31, 2017, we received approximately $294,811,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we had a cash balance of approximately $127,136,000, however, changing circumstances may cause us to consume funds significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control.\nOn September 25, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC relating to an underwritten public offering of 12,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.55 per share. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $68,573,000, after deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us. The offering closed on September 28, 2017 and we issued 12,400,000 shares of our common stock. We intend to use a majority of the net proceeds from this offering to fund pre-commercialization and commercialization activities for our TX-004HR and TX-001HR drug candidates. We currently intend to fund the next phase of our pre-commercialization and commercialization expenses for our TX-004HR and TX-001HR drug candidates through debt financing and are currently engaged in discussions to secure debt financing commitments. If we are successful in obtaining these commitments, we currently anticipate we would begin to draw on them following approval of either TX-004HR or TX-001HR.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, our days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 97 days compared to 92 days for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in our DSO as of December 31, 2017 was partially related to implementation of a new point of sale coupon system which lowered our revenues, as well as to the timing of payments received from our customers subsequent to December 31, 2017. We anticipate that our DSO will fluctuate in the future based upon a variety of factors, including longer payment terms associated with the centralization of the distribution channel for both our retail pharmacy distributors and wholesale distributors, as compared to the terms previously provided to our retail pharmacy distributors, changes in the healthcare industry and specific terms that may be extended in connection with the launch of our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved.\nWe believe that our existing cash will allow us to fund our operating plan through at least the next 12 months from the date of this Annual Report. However, if the commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates is delayed, our existing cash may be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements until we are able to commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates. If our available cash is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may curtail our sales, marketing and other pre-commercialization efforts and we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing shareholders. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or proposed products. Additionally, we may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe need substantial amounts of cash to complete the clinical development of and commercialize of our hormone therapy drug candidates. The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below:\nSummary of (Uses) and Sources of Cash\n\nOperating Activities\nThe principal use of cash in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was to fund our current expenses primarily related to supporting clinical development, scale-up and manufacturing activities and future commercial activities, adjusted for non-cash items. The increase of approximately $7,013,000 in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to changes in the components of working capital and lower non-cash compensation expense, as well as a decrease in net loss.\nThe decrease of approximately $9,902,000 in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to an increase in our net loss adjusted for non-cash compensation expense and changes in the components of working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease of approximately $428,000 in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in patent costs and costs relating to the purchase of fixed assets.\nThe increase of approximately $671,000 in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in patent costs and the increase in costs relating to the purchase of fixed assets.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities represent the principal source of our cash flow. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 provided net cash of approximately $72,584,000. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 included approximately $68,573,000 in proceeds from sale of our common stock and approximately $4,011,000 in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants.\nOn September 25, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC relating to an underwritten public offering of 12,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.55 per share. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $68,573,000, after deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us. The offering closed on September 28, 2017 and we issued 12,400,000 shares of our common stock.\nOur financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 provided net cash of approximately $137,226,000. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 included approximately $134,864,000 in proceeds from sale of our common stock and approximately $2,362,000 in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants.\nOn January 6, 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Cowen and Company, LLC, as the representatives of the several underwriters, or Underwriters, relating to an underwritten public offering of 15,151,515 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.25 per share. Under the terms of the underwriting agreement, we granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,272,727 additional shares of common stock, which option was exercised in full. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $134,864,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. The offering closed on January 12, 2016 and we issued 17,424,242 shares of our common stock.\nOur financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 provided net cash of approximately $92,973,000. The cash provided by financing activities included approximately $91,375,000 in proceeds from sale of our common stock and approximately $1,598,000 in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants.\nOn July 9, 2015, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and Guggenheim Securities, LLC, as the representatives of the several underwriters, or the Stifel Underwriters, relating to an underwritten public offering of 3,846,154 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.80 per share. Under the terms of the underwriting agreement, we granted the Stifel Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 576,923 additional shares of our common stock, which option was exercised in full. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $32,257,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expense payable by us. The offering closed on July 15, 2015 and we issued 4,423,077 shares of our common stock.\nOn February 10, 2015, we entered into an underwriting agreement, or the Cowen Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, as the representative of the several underwriters, or the Cowen Underwriters, relating to an underwritten public offering of 13,580,246 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $4.05 per share. Under the terms of the Cowen Agreement, we granted the Cowen Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,037,036 additional shares of our common stock, which option was exercised in full. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $59,118,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expense payable by us. The offering closed February 17, 2015 and we issued 15,617,282 shares of our common stock.\nCritical Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n \u25cf it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and \n \u25cf changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. \nWe base our estimates and judgments on our experience, our current knowledge, our beliefs of what could occur in the future, our observation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties: share-based compensation expense and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue on arrangements in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nPrescription Products\nWe sell our name brand and generic prescription products primarily through wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy distributors. We recognize revenue from prescription product sales, net of sales discounts, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, customer rebates, coupons and estimated returns.\nRevenue related to prescription products sold through wholesale distributors is recognized when the prescription products are shipped to the distributors and the control of the products passes to each distributor. We accept returns of unsalable prescription products sold through wholesale distributors within a return period of six months prior to and up to 12 months following product expiration. Our prescription products currently have a shelf life of 24 months from the date of manufacture.\nPrior to September 1, 2016, we recognized revenue related to prescription products sold through retail pharmacy distributors when the product was dispensed by the retail pharmacy distributor, at which point all revenue and discounts related to such product were known or determinable and there was no right of return with respect to such product. On September 1, 2016, we centralized the distribution channel for both our retail pharmacy distributors and wholesale distributors, in order to facilitate sales to a broader population of retail pharmacies and mitigate exposure to any one retail pharmacy. Beginning on September 1, 2016, all of our prescription products are distributed under the wholesale distributor model described above.\nWe offer various rebate programs in an effort to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace and to promote sales and customer loyalty. We estimate the allowance for consumer rebates and coupons that we have offered based on our experience and industry averages, which is reviewed, and adjusted if necessary, on a quarterly basis. We record distributor fees based on amounts stated in contracts and estimate chargebacks based on the number of units sold each period.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development, or R&D, expenses include internal R&D activities, services of external contract research organizations, or CROs, costs of their clinical research sites, manufacturing, scale-up and validation costs, and other activities. Internal R&D activity expenses include laboratory supplies, salaries, benefits, and non-cash share-based compensation expenses. Advance payments to be expensed in future research and development activities are capitalized, and were $0 and $228,933 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, all of which was included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. CRO activity expenses include preclinical laboratory experiments and clinical trial studies. Other activity expenses include regulatory consulting and legal fees and costs. The activities undertaken by our regulatory consultants that were classified as R&D expenses include assisting, consulting with, and advising our in-house staff with respect to various FDA submission processes, clinical trial processes, and scientific writing matters, including preparing protocols and FDA submissions. Legal activities that were classified as R&D expenses include professional research and advice regarding R&D, patents and regulatory matters. These consulting and legal expenses were direct costs associated with preparing, reviewing, and undertaking work for our clinical trials and investigative drugs. We charge internal R&D activities and other activity expenses to operations as incurred. We make payments to CROs based on agreed-upon terms, which may include payments in advance of a study starting date. We expense nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future R&D activities when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. We review and accrue CRO expenses and clinical trial study expenses based on services performed and rely on estimates of those costs applicable to the completion stage of a study as provided by CROs. Estimated accrued CRO costs are subject to revisions as such studies progress to completion. We charge revisions expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nShare-Based Compensation. We measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements may include options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance-based awards, and share appreciation rights. We amortize such compensation amounts, if any, over the respective service periods of the award. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, or the Black-Scholes Model, an acceptable model in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to value options. Option valuation models require the input of assumptions, including the expected life of the stock-based awards, the estimated stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term of the instrument. Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the term of the award. Prior to January 1, 2017, the expected volatility of share options was estimated based on a historical volatility analysis of peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available that were similar to our company with respect to industry, stage of life cycle, market capitalization, and financial leverage. On January 1, 2017, we began using our own stock price in our volatility calculation along with two other peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available that were similar to our company. Our calculation of estimated volatility is based on historical stock prices over a period equal to the expected term of the awards. The average expected life of warrants is based on the contractual terms of the awards. The average expected life of options is based on the contractual terms of the stock option using the simplified method. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. Calculating share-based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions, estimates of expected life of the share-based award, stock price volatility and risk-free interest rates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nEquity instruments ( instruments\u201d) issued to non-employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by ASC 505, Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees, or ASC 505. ASC 505 defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is when either (a) a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The estimated expense is recognized each period based on the current fair value of the award. As a result, the amount of expense related to awards to non-employees can fluctuate significantly during the period from the date of the grant through the final measurement date. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in ASC 505. We recognize the compensation expense for all share-based compensation granted based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with ASC 718. We generally recognize the compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period. We adopted ASU 2016-09, effective January 1, 2017, electing to account for forfeitures when they occur. Prior to that, we estimated the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience of forfeitures.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates when the rate change is enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nIn accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, we recognize the effect of uncertain income tax positions only if the positions are more likely than not of being sustained in an audit, based on the technical merits of the position. We measure recognized uncertain income tax positions using the largest amount that has a likelihood of being realized that is greater than 50%. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which those changes in judgment occur. We recognize both interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no tax positions relating to open tax returns that were considered to be uncertain. Our tax returns are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service three years after they are filed. Currently, years filed after 2013 are subject to review.\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In spite of our belief that we have appropriate support for all the positions taken on our tax returns, we acknowledge that certain positions may be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities. We determine the tax benefits more likely than not to be recognized with respect to uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and inherent uncertainty; therefore, our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely on estimates and assumptions. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, the final determination could be materially different than that which is reflected in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. federal tax code, including, but not limited to reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we have recorded a decrease related to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $49,500,000 and approximately $2,800,000, respectively, with a corresponding net adjustment to the valuation allowance of approximately $46,700,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Act modifies Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, by (1) expanding which employees are considered covered employees by including the chief financial officer, (2) providing that if an individual is a covered employee for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, the individual remains a covered employee for all future years, and (3) removing the exceptions for compensation stemming from contracts entered into on or before November 2, 2017, unless such contracts were materially modified on or after the date. Compensation agreements entered into and share-based payment awards granted after this date will be subject to the revised terms of IRC Section 162(m). In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting for share-based compensation arrangements under the Tax Act to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We must assess whether our valuation allowance analyses are affected by various aspects of the Tax Act. Since, as discussed herein, we have recorded provisional amounts related to certain portions of the Tax Act, any corresponding determination of the need for or change in a valuation allowance is also provisional.\nSegment Reporting. We are managed and operated as one business, which is focused on creating and commercializing products targeted exclusively for women. Our business operations are managed by a single management team that reports to the President of our Company. We do not operate separate lines of business with respect to any of our products and we do not prepare discrete financial information with respect to separate products. All product sales are derived from sales in the United States. Accordingly, we view our business as one reportable operating segment.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements . In May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-09 that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The new guidance will reduce diversity in practice and result in fewer changes to the terms of an award being accounted for as modifications. The new guidance will allow companies to make certain changes to awards without accounting for them as modifications. This guidance does not change the accounting for modifications. The guidance will be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including in an interim period. We adopted this guidance and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application. We adopted this guidance and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017, electing to account for forfeitures when they occur. The impact from adoption of the provisions related to forfeiture rates was reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a modified retrospective basis, resulting in an adjustment of approximately $31,000 to retained earnings. The impact from adoption of the provisions related to excess tax benefits or deficiencies in the provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital was adopted on a modified retrospective basis. Since we have a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, an amount equal to the cumulative adjustment made to retained earnings to recognize the previously unrecognized net operating losses from prior periods was made to the valuation allowance through retained earnings for the first quarter financial statements. Adoption of all other changes did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This guidance requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. The guidance also eliminates current real estate-specific provisions for all entities. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The standard is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. We are in the process of analyzing the quantitative impact of this guidance on our results of operations and financial position. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe the impact of this standard will be primarily related to the accounting for our operating lease.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under previous guidance. This may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB approved the proposal to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 standard by one year. Early adoption is permitted after December 15, 2016, and the standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. In 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify the implementation guidance for principal versus agent considerations (ASU 2016-08), accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations (ASU 2016-10), narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients (ASU 2016-12) and technical corrections and improvements to topic 606 (ASU 2016-20) in its new revenue standard. We have performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and are monitoring the activity of the FASB and the transition resource group as it relates to specific interpretive guidance. We have reviewed customer contracts and applied the five-step model of the new standard to our contracts as well as compared the results to our current accounting practices. We are currently in the process of drafting disclosures required by the new standard. At this point of our analysis, we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements but will potentially expand our disclosures related to contracts with customers.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions, which, in our judgment, are normal and customary for companies in our industry sector. These agreements are typically with business partners, clinical sites, and suppliers. Pursuant to these agreements, we generally agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to our drug candidates, use of such drug candidates, or other actions taken or omitted by us. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. We have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nIn the normal course of business, we may be confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits, claims, environmental actions or the actions of various regulatory agencies. We consult with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim. If, in our opinion, we have incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in our financial statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nFor each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 is as follows:\n\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently involved in any legal proceeding that we believe would have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEmployment Agreements\nWe have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executives that provide for compensation and certain other benefits. Under certain circumstances, including a change in control, some of these agreements provide for severance or other payments, if those circumstances occur during the term of the employment agreement.\nSeasonality\nThe specialty pharmaceutical industry component of women's health is not subject to seasonal sales fluctuation.\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>",
