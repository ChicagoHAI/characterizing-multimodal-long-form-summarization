MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBaker Hughes is a leading supplier of oilfield services, products, technology and systems use in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry, referred to as our oilfield operations. We manage our oilfield operations through four geographic segments consisting of North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian, and Middle East/Asia Pacific. Our Industrial Services businesses are reported in a fifth segment. As of December 31, 2015, Baker Hughes had approximately 43,000 employees compared to approximately 62,000 employees as of December 31, 2014.\nWithin our oilfield operations, the primary driver of our businesses is our customers' capital and operating expenditures dedicated to oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. The main products and services provided by oilfield operations fall into one of two categories, Drilling and Evaluation or Completion and Production. This classification is based on the two major phases of constructing an oil and/or natural gas well, the drilling phase and the completion phase, and how our products and services are utilized in each phase. We also provide products and services to the downstream chemicals, and process and pipeline services, referred to as Industrial Services.\n2015 was an extremely challenging year for the oil and natural gas industry. Crude oil prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 and experienced significant volatility in 2015, reaching a seven year low in December 2015 following OPEC's decision to eliminate its oil production ceiling. In response to the lower commodity prices in 2015, our customers curtailed their spending by reducing drilling activity in less economical unconventional plays and delaying well completion activities. As a result of these changes in market conditions and the significant decrease in activity and customer spending, we experienced a significant decline in demand and increased pricing pressure for our products and services.\nFor 2015, we generated revenue of $15.74 billion, a decrease of $8.81 billion, or 36%, compared to 2014. Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes was $1.97 billion for 2015 compared to net income attributable to Baker Hughes of $1.72 billion for 2014. The steep decline in activity, as evidenced by the 46% decline in the global rig count since the fourth quarter of 2014, and price deterioration experienced across all our segments is a large driver for the decline in revenue and profitability, most notably in North America. Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, we initiated actions to restructure and adjust our operations and cost structure to reflect reduced activity levels. As a result of these restructuring activities, we recorded charges totaling $830 million in 2015, which included workforce reductions, contract terminations, facility closures and the write-down of excess machinery and equipment. In addition to our restructuring activities, as a result of the downturn in the energy market and its impact on our business outlook, we determined that the carrying amount of certain assets exceeded their respective fair values; therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.16 billion. These charges have been excluded from the results of our operating segments.\nIn 2016, crude oil prices have continued to decline, reaching a twelve-year low in the first quarter. Although our visibility remains limited, we are expecting rig activity worldwide to continue to decline throughout the year and pricing pressures to continue across the globe. At current commodity prices, the global rig count could decline as much as 30% in 2016, as our customers' challenges of maximizing production, lowering their overall costs, and protecting cash flows are now more acute. Our products and services put us in an excellent position to help our customers achieve their business objectives and to capitalize on opportunities to continue to convert our capabilities into earnings. While targeting these opportunities, we remain focused on generating positive cash flow by proactively managing our cost structure, reducing our working capital, and maximizing return on invested capital.\nHalliburton Merger Agreement\nOn November 16, 2014, Baker Hughes and Halliburton entered into a definitive agreement and plan of Merger under which Halliburton will acquire all outstanding shares of Baker Hughes in a stock and cash transaction. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock of Baker Hughes will be converted into the right to receive 1.12 Halliburton shares plus $19.00 in cash. On March 27, 2015, Halliburton's stockholders approved the proposal to issue shares of Halliburton common stock as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In addition, Baker Hughes' stockholders adopted the Merger Agreement and thereby approved the proposed combination of the two companies. The transaction is still subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. In that regard, Baker Hughes and Halliburton have agreed to extend the period for the parties to obtain required competition approvals to April 30, 2016, as permitted under the Merger Agreement, and remain focused on completing the transaction as early as possible in 2016. However, Baker Hughes cannot predict with certainty when, or if, the pending Merger will be completed because completion of the transaction is subject to conditions beyond the control of Baker Hughes. For further information about the Merger, see Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nWe operate in more than 80 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources. Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is dependent on a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2)\n</td> <td>48.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3)\n</td> <td>2.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Bloomberg Dated Brent ( Brent\u201d) Oil Spot Price per Barrel\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Bloomberg West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) Cushing Crude Oil Spot Price per Barrel\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Bloomberg Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Outside North America, customer spending is most heavily influenced by Brent oil prices, which fluctuated significantly throughout the year, ranging from a high of $66.37/Bbl in May 2015 to a low of $34.78/Bbl in December 2015. Oil prices started to decline at the end of 2014 and continued to be volatile throughout the first half of 2015 as the market experienced a significant over supply of capacity. In the second half of 2015, and continuing into the first quarter of 2016, oil prices began to steadily decline again as rapidly increasing production, primarily from OPEC countries, coupled with unfavorable economic data from Europe and Asia, reignited fears of a long-term market imbalance. OPEC's decision in the fourth quarter to eliminate its official oil production ceiling, despite lower oil prices, put additional downward pressure on price expectations, and as a result, Brent oil prices approached seven-year lows and exited 2015 reflecting a 46% reduction compared to the peak earlier in the year.\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which, similar to Brent oil prices, fluctuated significantly throughout the year, with the highest prices being recorded in the second quarter. Overall, WTI oil prices ranged from a high of $61.43/Bbl in June 2015 to a low of $34.73/Bbl in December 2015.\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $2.61/mmBtu in 2015, representing a 40% decrease over the prior year and the lowest annual average since 1999. Natural gas prices began 2015 supported by a colder than normal winter but fell throughout the year as production and storage inventories hit record levels despite a significant decline in the natural gas-directed rig count. In the fourth quarter of 2015, above average temperatures and forecasts of a warmer winter in the U.S. drove natural gas prices to further decline reaching a low of $1.53/mmBtu in December. According to the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE\u201d), working natural gas in storage at the end of 2015 was 3,756 billion cubic feet (\"Bcf\"), which was 16.7%, or 536 Bcf, above the corresponding week in 2014.\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are governed by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and gas. Therefore, the counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity. However, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nBaker Hughes has been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and/or other outside sources. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable; however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as Russia, the Caspian region, Iran and onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities, including production testing, completion and workover, or are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. - onshore\n</td> <td>948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. - offshore\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>1,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North Sea\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Continental Europe\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Africa\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East\n</td> <td>406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outside North America\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worldwide\n</td> <td>2,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 Compared to 2014\nThe rig count in North America decreased 47% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by a 52% decline in oil-directed rigs, as a result of reduced spending from our customers as they adapt to a lower oil price environment. The oil-directed rig count decreased 51% in the U.S. as lower WTI prices have forced operators to reduce their exploration and development spending in order to protect their cash flows, as they focus more on production optimization opportunities. In Canada, the oil-directed rig count has decreased by 61% as many operators curtailed their drilling plans as most heavy oil sands projects are not economical at current oil prices. The natural gas-directed rig count in North America declined 32% in 2015 as natural gas prices deteriorated 40% compared to the 2014 average, with natural gas-directed drilling declining 32% in the U.S. and 33% in Canada.\nOutside North America, the rig count decreased 13% in 2015 compared to 2014, also driven by reduced customer spending and a lower oil price environment. The rig count in Latin America decreased 20% as a result of customer budgetary constraints across most of the region, primarily in Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador. The one exception was in the emerging unconventional plays in Argentina where activity remained relatively stable in 2015. The North Sea rig count decreased by 7%, largely due to a decline in the drilling activity in the Netherlands. The rig count in Continental Europe decreased by 24%, mainly as a result of reduced drilling in Turkey and Romania. In Africa, the rig count decreased 21%, predominantly due to reduced customer spending across the majority of the region, particularly in Libya, Chad, Angola, and Nigeria. The 2015 rig count in the Middle East remained unchanged from 2014 as activity declines in Iraq and Egypt were offset by increased activity in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait. The rig count in Asia Pacific decreased 13% as a consequence of reduced drilling activity primarily in India, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe rig count in North America increased 6% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily driven by a 9% growth in oil-directed rigs. The oil-directed rig count increased 11% in the U.S. as a result of increased exploration and production spending, but decreased by 6% in Canada where many operators curtailed their oil-directed drilling plans in the second half of 2014 due to high oil price differentials as compared to WTI and wet weather in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. The natural gas-directed rig count in North America declined 2% reflecting a 13% decrease in the U.S. partially offset by a 34% increase in Canada. Natural gas-directed drilling in the U.S. was negatively impacted by the continued weakness in North America natural gas prices which discouraged new investment in natural gas fields. In Canada, the increase in natural gas-directed rigs was driven by drilling in condensate rich zones in Alberta to service the oil sands drilling activity. Overall, Canada rig counts increased 7% in 2014 compared to 2013.\nOutside North America, the rig count increased 3% in 2014 compared to 2013. The rig count in Latin America decreased 5% as a result of reduced rig activity in Brazil and Mexico, partially offset by an increase in activity in the emerging unconventional plays in Argentina. The North Sea rig count decreased by 5%, primarily due to a decline in the rig activity in Norway. The rig count in Continental Europe increased by 13% with higher activity in Turkey and Romania. In Africa, the rig count increased 7% primarily due to higher activity in Kenya, Angola, and Chad. The rig count increased 9% in the Middle East due to higher activity in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait, slightly offset by a reduction in Iraq due to political unrest. The rig count in Asia Pacific increased 3% due to increased activity in offshore China, partially offset by activity reduction in Indonesia, Malaysia and New Zealand.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts.

The steep reduction in commodity prices experienced by the industry in 2015 severely impacted onshore North America exploration and production companies as a result of the higher lifting cost per barrel of many of these producers. These operators have addressed these cash constraints by reducing drilling activity in less economical unconventional plays, delaying well completion activities, and driving price discounts from their service providers as they await higher commodity prices. These lower activity levels, as evident in the 47% rig count drop, and deteriorating pricing conditions were the main drivers for the revenue decline in this segment. All product lines have been unfavorably impacted by the drop in activity, with production chemicals, deepwater operations and artificial lift showing the most resilience. Additionally, the reduced activity and well completion delays created an oversupply of hydraulic fracturing equipment, which caused the price deterioration in the onshore pressure pumping product line to be more severe. As such, we lost market share in this product line in 2015 as we worked to maintain cash flow positive operations despite an oversupplied market.\nNorth America loss before tax was $687 million in 2015, a decrease of $2.15 billion, or 147%, compared to profit before tax of $1.47 billion in 2014. The reduction in profitability was primarily due to the sharp decline in activity and an increasingly unfavorable pricing environment. Additionally, as a result of the industry downturn and its impact on our business, we incurred costs of $181 million in 2015 to write-down the carrying value of certain inventory. The impact from these unfavorable market conditions was partially mitigated by actions taken in the year to reduce our\nworkforce, close and consolidate facilities and improve commercial terms with vendors, which ultimately resulted in lower operating costs.\nLatin America\nLatin America revenue for 2015 was $1.80 billion, a decrease of $437 million, or 20%, compared to 2014. The reduction in this segment is attributed to activity declines across the region as a result of customer budgetary constraints, predominately in the Andean area where the rig count has declined 46%, and in Venezuela where we restructured our operational footprint in late 2014. This reduction was partially offset by revenue growth in Brazil from share gains in our drilling services product line.\nLatin America profit before tax decreased $156 million, or 54%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in profitability is mainly attributed to the decline in activity, foreign exchange losses, primarily in Argentina, and an increase in expense related to reserves for doubtful accounts. Additionally, we incurred costs of $13 million in 2015 to write-down the carrying value of certain inventory. This was partially offset by improvements made to our operational cost structure.\nEurope/Africa/Russia Caspian ( EARC\u201d)\nEARC revenue for 2015 was $3.28 billion, a decrease of $1.14 billion, or 26%, compared to 2014. The decrease was driven mainly by activity declines and unfavorable pricing across the region. Revenue was also negatively impacted by the unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates, which accounted for approximately one third of the revenue reduction in 2015. The deconsolidation of a joint venture in North Africa late last year also contributed to the decline in revenue. All product lines have been unfavorably impacted by the drop in activity and price, with production chemicals and drilling services showing the most resilience.\nEARC profit before tax decreased $464 million, or 75%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The unfavorable impact to profitability from pricing deterioration, lower activity levels, the change in foreign exchange rates, and increased costs related to reserves for doubtful accounts was partially offset by the savings from recent cost reduction measures. The unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates in 2015 accounted for approximately 40% of the decline in profitability. Also, 2014 included a $58 million charge associated with the restructuring of our operations in North Africa, and impairment of certain assets, that did not repeat in 2015.\nMiddle East/Asia Pacific ( MEAP\u201d)\nMEAP revenue for 2015 was $3.44 billion, a decrease of $1.02 billion, or 23%, compared to 2014. The revenue decline in this segment was driven primarily by lower activity across most of Asia, in particular China, Australia and Vietnam, and reduced revenue in Iraq. The revenue drop in Iraq is attributed to reduced activity, as evident by the 34% decline in rig count, and the rationalization of our operational footprint in the country, including completing our integrated operations activities. Revenue was also impacted by unfavorable pricing across the region.\nMEAP profit before tax decreased $471 million, or 70%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in profitability was driven largely by lower activity levels and unfavorable pricing. The current year also includes charges related to reducing our operations in Iraq. These reductions were partially offset by the benefit of the recent cost-saving actions.\nIndustrial Services\nIndustrial Services revenue was $1.22 billion, a decrease of $149 million, or 11%, compared to 2014. The decline in revenue in this segment was driven primarily by reduced activity and the unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates.\nIndustrial Services profit before tax decreased 18% in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in profitability resulting from lower activity levels was partially offset by cost-saving efforts. However, Industrial Services profit before tax for the prior year included integration costs related to the pipeline services business acquired in 2014, which we did not incur in 2015.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>2,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian\n</td> <td>4,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East/Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>4,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial Services\n</td> <td>1,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Profit Before Tax:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian\n</td> <td>621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East/Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial Services\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operations\n</td> <td>3,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>(544\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNorth America\nNorth America revenue in 2014 increased $1.2 billion or 11% compared to 2013, with rig counts increasing 6% from the prior year average. The increase in revenue was driven almost entirely by our U.S. onshore operations, where higher activity levels, improved utilization and market conditions in pressure pumping, along with increased demand for new technologies in the unconventional plays contributed to solid growth across all our districts and product lines. The largest contributor to the revenue growth was our pressure pumping operations, where market conditions gradually improved during the year, reversing the over supply of hydraulic fracturing equipment; which, when combined with our multi-year improvement initiative for this product line, resulted in improved utilization and increased efficiencies. Our artificial lift, drilling services and drill bit product lines also delivered exceptionally strong growth, as demand increased for our new technologies specifically designed for the unconventional plays. Revenue in Canada declined in 2014 as compared to 2013, in part due to a 6% decline in the oil-directed rig count, which is a significant driver of our operations in the country. Revenue in the Gulf of Mexico declined slightly despite a relatively flat rig count in 2014 compared to 2013. The revenue decline is attributable to activity delays, primarily in drilling and stimulation, that resulted from unusually strong ocean currents in the second half of 2014.\nNorth America profit before tax was $1,466 million in 2014, an increase of $498 million or 51% compared to 2013. In addition to the strong activity levels in U.S. onshore, increased profitability was driven by improved contractual terms and utilization in our pressure pumping operations, as well as other efficiency gains and cost savings recognized as part of our pressure pumping profit improvement plan. The growing demand for new technologies, which command a higher premium, also contributed to the improvement. In the Gulf of Mexico, profitability improved, despite the decline in revenue, as a result of a more favorable mix of revenue with an increase in deepwater completion systems. In Canada, profitability decreased in line with the revenue decline, as costs savings achieved in pressure pumping were offset by the foreign exchange impact of the weakening Canadian dollar. Profitability in 2014 was negatively impacted by $29 million of severance costs and $13 million of costs associated with a technology royalty agreement.\nLatin America\nLatin America revenue decreased $71 million or 3% in 2014 compared to 2013. Revenue reductions in Brazil and Venezuela were partially offset by increased revenue throughout the rest of the region. Revenue declined across most product lines in Brazil due to lower activity levels in 2014, as evidenced by a 27% reduction in the rig count compared to 2013. Revenue in Venezuela decreased across all product lines as a result of the devaluation of the Bolivares Fuertes relative to the U.S. Dollar\nLatin America profit before tax increased $224 million or 339% in 2014 compared to 2013. The significant improvement in profitability can be primarily attributed to cost reduction strategies implemented throughout the region in the second half of 2013, with particular focus on Brazil. 2013 includes a charge of $19 million for severance related to these actions. Increased activity in Argentina, Mexico and Ecuador also contributed to the profitability improvement in 2014. Profitability was also impacted by foreign exchange losses of $12 million and $23 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to the currency devaluation in Venezuela.\nEurope/Africa/Russia Caspian\nEARC revenue increased $376 million or 9% in 2014 compared to 2013. In 2014, we delivered strong revenue growth in Africa, Continental Europe and Russia Caspian. Revenue was negatively impacted by the unfavorable change in exchange rates of several currencies including the Russian Ruble relative to the U.S. Dollar. In Africa, revenue increased as a result of activity growth and share gains across most of the region, predominately in West Africa. These increases were slightly offset by activity declines in Libya due to political instability during the third quarter of 2014. In Continental Europe, revenue growth was driven by increased demand for our completion and production product lines. In the Russia Caspian region, revenue growth was driven by increased activity in our completion and production product lines.\nEARC profit before tax increased $30 million or 5% in 2014 compared to 2013. Incremental profitability growth from increased revenue was almost entirely offset by a $58 million charge associated with the restructuring of our operations in North Africa and impairment of certain assets, mainly due to the recent disruption in our operations in Libya. Profitability was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange losses as a result of the devaluation of several currencies, including the Russian Ruble.\nMiddle East/Asia Pacific\nMEAP revenue increased $597 million or 15% in 2014 compared to 2013, while the corresponding rig count increased only 7% over the same period. We posted strong revenue growth in virtually all geographies, most notably in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the Arabian Gulf, Southeast Asia and China. In Saudi Arabia, revenue increases were primarily related to activity growth in our integrated operations contracts. In addition, we experienced strong demand for our drilling services and completion services product lines. In Iraq, revenue increased in 2014 over the prior year, as 2013 was negatively impacted by a significant disruption in operations in the fourth quarter partially offset by a decline in activity in 2014 due to a demobilization on a major contract. Revenue increased in the Arabian Gulf due to increased demand for our drilling services and pressure pumping product lines in the United Arab Emirates and India. Within Asia Pacific, revenue growth was strongest in South East Asia and China, predominately in our drilling services product line.\nMEAP profit before tax improved $218 million or 48% in 2014 compared to 2013. The primary driver of the increase in profit before tax was higher incremental profit on increased revenue across the segment, most notably in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Further, we experienced a favorable shift in product mix with a higher proportion of revenue derived from our drilling services product line. Profit before tax in 2013 was negatively impacted by $79 million of losses in Iraq related to the significant disruption to our operations, expenses associated with personnel movements and security measures, and other non-recurring items.\nIndustrial Services\nIndustrial Services revenue increased 7% and profit before tax decreased 12% in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by the acquisition of a complementary pipeline services business in the\nthird quarter of 2014. Profitability in the segment decreased as a result of integration expenses related to this acquisition, along with an increase in environmental costs compared to the prior year.\nCosts and Expenses\nThe table below details certain data from our consolidated statements of income (loss) and as a percentage of revenue.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>14,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and engineering\n</td> <td>483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing, general and administrative\n</td> <td>1,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 92% and 80% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result of the steep decline in activity and customer spending, we experienced significant pricing pressure and a decline in the demand for our products and services. Despite actions to restructure our global operations to operate in a lower price and activity environment, the decline in revenue has outpaced the benefit of cost saving measures. Additionally, the product lines most significantly impacted by the downturn in rig activity are also the most capital-intensive. Accordingly, the fixed costs associated with those product lines lessened the positive impact of our cost reduction efforts in 2015. Cost of revenue for 2015 was also negatively impacted by a charge of $194 million to adjust the carrying value of certain inventory due to the industry-wide market decline, and $87 million of expenses related to the Merger.\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 80% and 83% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The improvement in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the continued improvement in our U.S. onshore pressure pumping business, which resulted in higher asset utilization and organizational efficiencies, as well as improved contractual terms. In Latin America, margins improved due to cost reduction strategies implemented throughout the region in the second half of 2013. Margins in the MEAP segment were improved by higher incremental profit on increased revenue, combined with a favorable shift in product mix. Reduced disruptions in our Iraq operations for 2014 also contributed to lower cost of revenue in the MEAP segment. In the EARC segment, profitability increased in Continental Europe, the United Kingdom and most of Africa but were partially offset by restructuring charges of $58 million associated with our operations in North Africa, primarily from disruptions in Libya. These improvements were partially offset by $113 million of increased depreciation expense across all segments except Latin America; $29 million of severance charges in North America; and $29 million of costs associated with a technology royalty agreement.\nResearch and Engineering\nResearch and engineering expenses decreased 21% in 2015 compared to 2014, yet increased slightly as a percentage of revenue. The reduction in research and engineering expense was driven by cost reduction measures, partially offset by $17 million of expenses related to the Merger.\nResearch and engineering expenses increased 10% in 2014 compared to 2013 as we continued our commitment to invest in the research and product development required to meet our customers' need for innovative new products and emerging technologies, focusing on lowering the cost of well construction, optimizing well production and increasing ultimate recoveries. As a result of our research and development activities in 2014, we commercially launched over 160 new products and services.\nMarketing, General and Administrative\nMarketing, general and administrative ( MG&A\u201d) expenses decreased 8% in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in MG&A costs is mainly a result of workforce reductions and lower discretionary spending. Included in MG&A expenses for 2015 are costs of $191 million related to the Merger, which partially offset the impact of the cost reduction measures.\nMG&A expenses decreased 3% in 2014 compared to 2013. MG&A expenses in 2014 includes a net gain of $34 million recognized on the deconsolidation of a jointly owned legal entity. Cost savings experienced across the organization were mostly offset by a charge of $14 million related to the impairment of a technology investment and $11 million of Merger related expenses. Also included in MG&A in 2014 and 2013 are foreign exchange losses of $12 million and $23 million, respectively, due to the currency devaluation in Venezuela.\nImpairment and Restructuring Charges\nDuring 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $830 million consisting of $436 million for workforce reduction costs, $121 million for contract termination costs and $273 million for asset impairments related to excess machinery and equipment and facilities. Total cash paid during 2015 related to these charges was $446 million. In addition to our restructuring activities, in response to the downturn in the energy market and its impact on our business outlook, we determined that the carrying amount of a number of our assets exceeded their respective fair values; therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.16 billion. These charges have been excluded from the results of our operating segments. For further discussion of these impairment and restructuring charges, see Note 3. Impairment and Restructuring Charges\u201d of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nThe reduction in costs from eliminating depreciation and reduced employee expenses in 2015 was approximately $700 million and is expected to be more than $1.6 billion on an annualized basis in 2016.\nLitigation Settlement\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a charge of $62 million related to previously disclosed litigation settlements for wage and hour lawsuits. A portion of this settlement was to be paid on a claims made basis and during the second quarter of 2015, the date passed by which the class members could file a claim under this provision of the settlement agreement. The amount of claims made was less than estimated and, accordingly, we reduced the accrual by approximately $13 million, which was recorded as an adjustment for litigation settlements during the second quarter of 2015.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income of $20 million, was $217 million in 2015, a decrease of $15 million compared to $232 million in 2014. The decrease is due primarily to lower short-term borrowings in Latin America and an increase in interest income. Interest expense, net of interest income of $13 million, remained relatively flat in 2014 when compared to $234 million in 2013.\nIncome Taxes\nTotal income tax benefit was $639 million in 2015 compared to income tax expense of $896 million and $612 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our effective tax rate on operating profits or losses in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 24.5%, 34.1% and 35.7%, respectively. The 2015 effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35% due to losses in foreign jurisdictions with no tax benefit and adjustments to prior years' tax positions, partially offset by favorable amended returns and other return to accrual adjustments. The 2014 effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35% due to lower rates on certain international operations, partially offset by state income taxes and adjustments to prior years' tax positions. The 2013 effective tax rate is higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35% due to higher rates on certain international operations, primarily resulting from foreign losses with no tax benefit, and state income taxes partially offset by adjustments to prior years' tax positions.\nCOMPLIANCE\nWe do business in more than 80 countries, including approximately 16 of the 40 countries having the lowest scores in the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index survey for 2015, which indicates high levels of corruption. We devote significant resources to the development, maintenance, communication and enforcement of our Business Code of Conduct, our anti-bribery compliance policies, our internal control processes and procedures and numerous other compliance related policies. Notwithstanding the devotion of such resources, and in part as a consequence thereof, from time to time we discover or receive information alleging potential violations of laws and regulations, including the FCPA and our policies, processes and procedures. We conduct timely internal investigations of these potential violations and take appropriate action depending upon the outcome of the investigation.\nWe anticipate that the devotion of significant resources to compliance-related issues, including the necessity for investigations, will continue to be an aspect of doing business in a number of the countries in which oil and natural gas exploration, development and production take place and in which we conduct operations. Compliance-related issues have, from time to time, limited our ability to do business or have raised the cost of operating in these countries. In order to provide products and services in some of these countries, we may in the future utilize ventures with third parties, sell products to distributors or otherwise modify our business approach in order to improve our ability to conduct our business in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and our Business Code of Conduct.\nOur Best-in-Class Global Ethics and Compliance Program (our Compliance Program\u201d) is based on (i) our Core Values of Integrity, Performance, Teamwork, Learning and Courage; (ii) the standards contained in our Business Code of Conduct; and (iii) the laws of the countries where we operate. Our Compliance Program is referenced within the Company as C2\u201d or Completely Compliant.\u201d The Completely Compliant theme is intended to establish the proper Tone-at-the-Top throughout the Company. Employees are consistently reminded that they play a crucial role in ensuring that the Company always conducts its business ethically, legally and safely.\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We have comprehensive internal policies over such areas as facilitating payments; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations connected to non-U.S. government officials; payments to non-U.S. commercial sales representatives; and the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes.

At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.32 billion, of which approximately $2.01 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries. A substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 was reinvested in our international operations as our intent is to use this cash to, among other things, fund the operations of our foreign subsidiaries. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., we may be required to provide taxes on certain of those funds based on applicable U.S. tax rates net of foreign tax credits. We have a committed revolving credit facility (the \"credit facility\") with commercial banks and a related commercial paper program under which the maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the credit facility and the commercial paper program is $2.50 billion. At December 31, 2015, we had no commercial paper outstanding; therefore, the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility as of December 31, 2015 was $2.50 billion. We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and the available credit facility, including the issuance of commercial paper, will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs. In 2015, we used cash to pay for a variety of activities including working capital needs, capital expenditures and payment of dividends.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(905\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,659\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(282\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities provided $1.80 billion and $2.95 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1.16 billion in 2015 primarily due to the decrease in net income after noncash charges, partially offset by the reduction in working capital (receivables, inventories and accounts payable), which provided more cash in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower activity levels. Additionally, the decrease in net income and market activity resulted in lower income taxes paid. Included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2015 are payments of $446 million made for employee severance and contract termination costs as a result of our restructuring activities initiated during the year.\nCash flows from operating activities provided $2.95 billion and $3.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $208 million in 2014 primarily due to the increase in working capital, which used more cash in 2014 compared to 2013, partially offset by the increase in net income. The main drivers of the increase in working capital were due to the increase in activity levels and the continuation of vendor management initiatives, partially offset by improved collections. Additionally, the increase in net income and market activity resulted in higher income taxes paid.\nInvesting Activities\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $965 million, $1.79 billion and $2.09 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decline in capital expenditures in 2015 is a result of lower demand for our products and services. While the majority of these expenditures were for machinery and equipment, it also includes expenditures for new facilities, expansions of existing facilities and other infrastructure projects.\nProceeds from the disposal of assets were $388 million, $437 million and $455 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These disposals related to equipment that was lost-in-hole and property, machinery, and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the year.\nIn 2015, we purchased short-term and long-term investment securities totaling $310 million. In 2014, we paid $314 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $7 million. Under the Merger Agreement with Halliburton, as described in Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, we have restrictions on our ability to acquire or dispose of any businesses while the Merger is pending.\nFinancing Activities\nWe had net repayments of commercial paper and other short-term debt of $45 million, $248 million and $571 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nTotal debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 was $4.04 billion, a decrease of $92 million compared to December 31, 2014. The total debt-to-capital (defined as total debt plus equity) ratio was 0.20 at December 31, 2015 and 0.18 at December 31, 2014. We received proceeds of $116 million, $216 million and $101 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase our common stock from time to time. During 2013, our Board of Directors increased the authorization to purchase our common stock under our share repurchase program by $800 million. During 2015, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. We had authorization remaining to repurchase approximately $1.05 billion in common stock at the end of 2015. During 2014, we repurchased 9.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $65.75 per share, for a total of $600 million. During 2013, we repurchased 6.3 million shares of our common stock at an average prices of $55.59 per share, for a total of $350 million.\nWe paid dividends of $297 million, $279 million and $267 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nUnder the Merger Agreement with Halliburton, as described in Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, we have generally agreed not to repurchase any shares of common stock or increase the quarterly dividend while the Merger is pending.\nAvailable Credit Facility\nAs discussed above, we have a committed revolving credit facility with commercial banks and a related commercial paper program under which the maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the credit facility and the commercial paper program is $2.5 billion. The credit facility matures in September 2016 and contains certain covenants which, among other things, restrict certain Merger transactions or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or a significant subsidiary and limit the amount of subsidiary indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the credit facility, covenant defaults and other customary defaults. We were in compliance with all of the credit facility's covenants, and there were no direct borrowings under the credit facility during 2015. Under the commercial paper program, we may issue from time to time up to $2.5 billion in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 270 days. The amount available to borrow under the credit facility is reduced by the amount of any commercial paper outstanding. At December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.\nIf market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility. However, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we would seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nWe believe our current credit ratings would allow us to obtain interim financing over and above our existing credit facility for any currently unforeseen significant needs.\nCash Requirements\nIn 2016, we believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and the available credit facility will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. If necessary, we may issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. In light of the current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2016 will be made as appropriate at a rate that we estimate would equal $450 million to $550 million on an annualized basis. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $300 million to $350 million in 2016. For all defined benefit, defined contribution and other postretirement plans, we expect to contribute between $245 million to $275 million to these plans in 2016. See Note 13. \"Employee Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion.\nIn May 2014, the Board of Directors approved a $0.02 per share increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per share of common stock for the August 2014 holders of record over the previous quarter's dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. We anticipate paying dividends in the range of $70 million to $78 million in the first quarter of 2016.\nUnder the Merger Agreement with Halliburton, as described in Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, we have agreed not to increase the quarterly dividend while the Merger is pending.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015. Certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual cash obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and capital lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>2,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td>590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities for uncertain income tax positions (5)\n</td> <td>312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including capital lease obligations.

It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than normal operating leases, as discussed above. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. The Audit/Ethics Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on the aging status of the customer accounts or when it becomes evident that the customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $383 million, or 11%, and $224 million, or 4%, of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our\nallowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required. A five percent change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would have had an impact on income before income taxes of approximately $19 million in 2015.\nInventory Reserves\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or market. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, inventory reserves totaled $278 million, or 9%, and $319 million, or 7%, of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required. A five percent change in this inventory reserve balance would have had an impact on income before income taxes of approximately $14 million in 2015.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nThe purchase price of acquired businesses is allocated to its identifiable assets and liabilities based upon estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired in a business acquisition. Our goodwill at December 31, 2015 and 2014, totaled $6.07 billion and $6.08 billion, respectively. We perform an annual test of goodwill for impairment as of October 1 of each year for each of our reporting units which are the same as our five reportable segments. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of performing a qualitative or quantitative assessment to determine if an impairment has occurred. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we would be required to perform a quantitative impairment test for goodwill. In 2015 and 2014, we performed a qualitative assessment for our annual goodwill impairment test. In 2013, a quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment was made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value.\nIn performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis for 2015, our qualitative assessment included consideration of current industry and market conditions and circumstances as well as any mitigating factors that would most affect the fair value of the Company and its reporting units. Among those mitigating factors, we considered the value of the consideration to be received at closing of the Merger, based on the terms of the Merger Agreement, compared to the carrying value of the Company and its reporting units. Based on our assessment and consideration of the totality of the facts and circumstances, including our business environment in the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company or any of its reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts. As such, no impairments of goodwill were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, or any of the prior years included in the accompanying financial statements.\nIn determining the carrying amount of reporting units, corporate and other assets and liabilities are allocated to the extent that they relate to the operations of those reporting units. When necessary, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit using various valuation techniques, including a market approach, a comparable transactions approach and discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") methodology. The market approach and comparable transactions approach provide value indications for a company through a comparison with guideline public companies or guideline transactions, respectively. Both entail selecting relevant financial information of the subject company, and capitalizing those amounts using valuation multiples that are based on empirical market observations. The DCF methodology includes, but is not limited to, assumptions regarding matters such as discount rates, anticipated growth rates, expected profitability rates and the timing of expected future cash flows. Unanticipated changes, including even small revisions, to these assumptions could result in a provision for impairment in a future period. In addition, a decline in our stock price could result in an impairment. Given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific assets and time-frames, it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions.\nLong-lived assets, which include property and equipment, intangible assets other than goodwill, and certain other assets, comprise a significant amount of our total assets. We review the carrying values of these assets for impairment periodically, and at least annually for certain intangible assets or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. This requires us to make judgments regarding long-term forecasts of future revenue and costs and cash flows related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions and technological developments.\nIncome Taxes\nThe liability method is used for determining our income tax provisions, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. These estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets. Historically, changes to valuation allowances have been caused by major changes in the business cycle in certain countries and changes in local country law. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions.\nWe operate in more than 80 countries under many legal forms. As a result, we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases, including actual income before taxes, deemed profits (which are generally determined using a percentage of revenue rather than profits) and withholding taxes based on revenue. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.\nOur tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts. We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. Resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty; accordingly, we provide taxes only for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings. The resulting change to our tax liability, if any, is dependent on numerous factors including, among others, the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities; the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process; the impartiality of the local courts; the number of countries in which we do business; and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce, or fail to produce, an offsetting tax change in other countries. Our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate. However, past experience is only a guide, and the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued.\nIn addition to the aforementioned assessments that have been received from various tax authorities, we also provide for taxes for uncertain tax positions where formal assessments have not been received. The determination of these liabilities requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events. Once established, we adjust these amounts only when more information is available or when a future event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves such as changes in the facts or law, judicial decisions regarding the application of existing law or a favorable audit outcome. We believe that the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on our\nconsolidated statements of income (loss) for a particular period and on our effective tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs.\nPensions and Postretirement Benefit Obligations\nPensions and postretirement benefit obligations and the related expenses are calculated using actuarial models and methods. This involves the use of two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected rate of return on assets, both of which are important elements in determining pension expense and in measuring plan liabilities. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually, and as necessary, we utilize third party actuarial firms to assist us. Although considered less critical, other assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and related expenses, such as demographic factors like retirement age, mortality and turnover, are also evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our actual and expected experience.\nThe discount rate enables us to determine expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. The development of the discount rate for our largest plans was based on a bond matching model whereby the cash flows underlying the projected benefit obligation are matched against a yield curve constructed from a bond portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income securities. Use of a lower discount rate would increase the present value of benefit obligations and increase pension expense. We used a weighted average discount rate of 3.6% in 2015, 4.5% in 2014 and 4.0% in 2013 to determine pension expense. A 50 basis point reduction in the weighted average discount rate would have increased pension expense and the projected benefit obligation of our principal pension plans by approximately $7 million and $85 million, respectively, in 2015.\nTo determine the expected rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected future returns on various categories of plan assets. A lower rate of return would decrease plan assets which results in higher pension expense. We assumed a weighted average expected rate of return on our plan assets of 6.8% in 2015, 6.7% in 2014 and 6.9% in 2013. A 50 basis point reduction in the weighted average expected rate of return on assets of our principal pension plans would have increased pension expense by approximately $7 million in 2015.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The ASU will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in U.S. GAAP and will require entities to recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The pronouncement is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2017. We have not completed an evaluation of the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-3, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We currently report debt issuance costs consistent with the guidance of this ASU; therefore there will be no impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures upon adoption.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-5, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. The ASU provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license and the related accounting treatment. The pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires inventory measured using the FIFO or average cost methods to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost or\nnet realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Currently, inventory measured using these methods is required to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost or market with market defined as replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin. This pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We have not completed an evaluation of the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We have not completed an evaluation of the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThere were no significant related party transactions during the three years ended December 31, 2015.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K, including MD&A and certain statements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a forward-looking statement\u201d).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBaker Hughes is a leading supplier of oilfield services, products, technology and systems use in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry, referred to as our oilfield operations. We manage our oilfield operations through four geographic segments consisting of North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian, and Middle East/Asia Pacific. Our Industrial Services businesses are reported in a fifth segment. As of December 31, 2015, Baker Hughes had approximately 43,000 employees compared to approximately 62,000 employees as of December 31, 2014.\nWithin our oilfield operations, the primary driver of our businesses is our customers' capital and operating expenditures dedicated to oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. The main products and services provided by oilfield operations fall into one of two categories, Drilling and Evaluation or Completion and Production. This classification is based on the two major phases of constructing an oil and/or natural gas well, the drilling phase and the completion phase, and how our products and services are utilized in each phase. We also provide products and services to the downstream chemicals, and process and pipeline services, referred to as Industrial Services.\n2015 was an extremely challenging year for the oil and natural gas industry. Crude oil prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 and experienced significant volatility in 2015, reaching a seven year low in December 2015 following OPEC's decision to eliminate its oil production ceiling. In response to the lower commodity prices in 2015, our customers curtailed their spending by reducing drilling activity in less economical unconventional plays and delaying well completion activities. As a result of these changes in market conditions and the significant decrease in activity and customer spending, we experienced a significant decline in demand and increased pricing pressure for our products and services.\nFor 2015, we generated revenue of $15.74 billion, a decrease of $8.81 billion, or 36%, compared to 2014. Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes was $1.97 billion for 2015 compared to net income attributable to Baker Hughes of $1.72 billion for 2014. The steep decline in activity, as evidenced by the 46% decline in the global rig count since the fourth quarter of 2014, and price deterioration experienced across all our segments is a large driver for the decline in revenue and profitability, most notably in North America. Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, we initiated actions to restructure and adjust our operations and cost structure to reflect reduced activity levels. As a result of these restructuring activities, we recorded charges totaling $830 million in 2015, which included workforce reductions, contract terminations, facility closures and the write-down of excess machinery and equipment. In addition to our restructuring activities, as a result of the downturn in the energy market and its impact on our business outlook, we determined that the carrying amount of certain assets exceeded their respective fair values; therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.16 billion. These charges have been excluded from the results of our operating segments.\nIn 2016, crude oil prices have continued to decline, reaching a twelve-year low in the first quarter. Although our visibility remains limited, we are expecting rig activity worldwide to continue to decline throughout the year and pricing pressures to continue across the globe. At current commodity prices, the global rig count could decline as much as 30% in 2016, as our customers' challenges of maximizing production, lowering their overall costs, and protecting cash flows are now more acute. Our products and services put us in an excellent position to help our customers achieve their business objectives and to capitalize on opportunities to continue to convert our capabilities into earnings. While targeting these opportunities, we remain focused on generating positive cash flow by proactively managing our cost structure, reducing our working capital, and maximizing return on invested capital.\nHalliburton Merger Agreement\nOn November 16, 2014, Baker Hughes and Halliburton entered into a definitive agreement and plan of Merger under which Halliburton will acquire all outstanding shares of Baker Hughes in a stock and cash transaction. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock of Baker Hughes will be converted into the right to receive 1.12 Halliburton shares plus $19.00 in cash. On March 27, 2015, Halliburton's stockholders approved the proposal to issue shares of Halliburton common stock as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In addition, Baker Hughes' stockholders adopted the Merger Agreement and thereby approved the proposed combination of the two companies. The transaction is still subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. In that regard, Baker Hughes and Halliburton have agreed to extend the period for the parties to obtain required competition approvals to April 30, 2016, as permitted under the Merger Agreement, and remain focused on completing the transaction as early as possible in 2016. However, Baker Hughes cannot predict with certainty when, or if, the pending Merger will be completed because completion of the transaction is subject to conditions beyond the control of Baker Hughes. For further information about the Merger, see Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nWe operate in more than 80 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources. Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is dependent on a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2)\n</td> <td>48.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3)\n</td> <td>2.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Bloomberg Dated Brent ( Brent\u201d) Oil Spot Price per Barrel \n (2) Bloomberg West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) Cushing Crude Oil Spot Price per Barrel \n (3) Bloomberg Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit  Outside North America, customer spending is most heavily influenced by Brent oil prices, which fluctuated significantly throughout the year, ranging from a high of $66.37/Bbl in May 2015 to a low of $34.78/Bbl in December 2015. Oil prices started to decline at the end of 2014 and continued to be volatile throughout the first half of 2015 as the market experienced a significant over supply of capacity. In the second half of 2015, and continuing into the first quarter of 2016, oil prices began to steadily decline again as rapidly increasing production, primarily from OPEC countries, coupled with unfavorable economic data from Europe and Asia, reignited fears of a long-term market imbalance. OPEC's decision in the fourth quarter to eliminate its official oil production ceiling, despite lower oil prices, put additional downward pressure on price expectations, and as a result, Brent oil prices approached seven-year lows and exited 2015 reflecting a 46% reduction compared to the peak earlier in the year.\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which, similar to Brent oil prices, fluctuated significantly throughout the year, with the highest prices being recorded in the second quarter. Overall, WTI oil prices ranged from a high of $61.43/Bbl in June 2015 to a low of $34.73/Bbl in December 2015.\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $2.61/mmBtu in 2015, representing a 40% decrease over the prior year and the lowest annual average since 1999. Natural gas prices began 2015 supported by a colder than normal winter but fell throughout the year as production and storage inventories hit record levels despite a significant decline in the natural gas-directed rig count. In the fourth quarter of 2015, above average temperatures and forecasts of a warmer winter in the U.S. drove natural gas prices to further decline reaching a low of $1.53/mmBtu in December. According to the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE\u201d), working natural gas in storage at the end of 2015 was 3,756 billion cubic feet (\"Bcf\"), which was 16.7%, or 536 Bcf, above the corresponding week in 2014.\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are governed by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and gas. Therefore, the counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity. However, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nBaker Hughes has been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and/or other outside sources. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable; however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as Russia, the Caspian region, Iran and onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities, including production testing, completion and workover, or are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. - onshore\n</td> <td>948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. - offshore\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>1,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North Sea\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Continental Europe\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Africa\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East\n</td> <td>406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outside North America\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worldwide\n</td> <td>2,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 Compared to 2014\nThe rig count in North America decreased 47% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by a 52% decline in oil-directed rigs, as a result of reduced spending from our customers as they adapt to a lower oil price environment. The oil-directed rig count decreased 51% in the U.S. as lower WTI prices have forced operators to reduce their exploration and development spending in order to protect their cash flows, as they focus more on production optimization opportunities. In Canada, the oil-directed rig count has decreased by 61% as many operators curtailed their drilling plans as most heavy oil sands projects are not economical at current oil prices. The natural gas-directed rig count in North America declined 32% in 2015 as natural gas prices deteriorated 40% compared to the 2014 average, with natural gas-directed drilling declining 32% in the U.S. and 33% in Canada.\nOutside North America, the rig count decreased 13% in 2015 compared to 2014, also driven by reduced customer spending and a lower oil price environment. The rig count in Latin America decreased 20% as a result of customer budgetary constraints across most of the region, primarily in Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador. The one exception was in the emerging unconventional plays in Argentina where activity remained relatively stable in 2015. The North Sea rig count decreased by 7%, largely due to a decline in the drilling activity in the Netherlands. The rig count in Continental Europe decreased by 24%, mainly as a result of reduced drilling in Turkey and Romania. In Africa, the rig count decreased 21%, predominantly due to reduced customer spending across the majority of the region, particularly in Libya, Chad, Angola, and Nigeria. The 2015 rig count in the Middle East remained unchanged from 2014 as activity declines in Iraq and Egypt were offset by increased activity in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait. The rig count in Asia Pacific decreased 13% as a consequence of reduced drilling activity primarily in India, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe rig count in North America increased 6% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily driven by a 9% growth in oil-directed rigs. The oil-directed rig count increased 11% in the U.S. as a result of increased exploration and production spending, but decreased by 6% in Canada where many operators curtailed their oil-directed drilling plans in the second half of 2014 due to high oil price differentials as compared to WTI and wet weather in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. The natural gas-directed rig count in North America declined 2% reflecting a 13% decrease in the U.S. partially offset by a 34% increase in Canada. Natural gas-directed drilling in the U.S. was negatively impacted by the continued weakness in North America natural gas prices which discouraged new investment in natural gas fields. In Canada, the increase in natural gas-directed rigs was driven by drilling in condensate rich zones in Alberta to service the oil sands drilling activity. Overall, Canada rig counts increased 7% in 2014 compared to 2013.\nOutside North America, the rig count increased 3% in 2014 compared to 2013. The rig count in Latin America decreased 5% as a result of reduced rig activity in Brazil and Mexico, partially offset by an increase in activity in the emerging unconventional plays in Argentina. The North Sea rig count decreased by 5%, primarily due to a decline in the rig activity in Norway. The rig count in Continental Europe increased by 13% with higher activity in Turkey and Romania. In Africa, the rig count increased 7% primarily due to higher activity in Kenya, Angola, and Chad. The rig count increased 9% in the Middle East due to higher activity in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait, slightly offset by a reduction in Iraq due to political unrest. The rig count in Asia Pacific increased 3% due to increased activity in offshore China, partially offset by activity reduction in Indonesia, Malaysia and New Zealand.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts.

The steep reduction in commodity prices experienced by the industry in 2015 severely impacted onshore North America exploration and production companies as a result of the higher lifting cost per barrel of many of these producers. These operators have addressed these cash constraints by reducing drilling activity in less economical unconventional plays, delaying well completion activities, and driving price discounts from their service providers as they await higher commodity prices. These lower activity levels, as evident in the 47% rig count drop, and deteriorating pricing conditions were the main drivers for the revenue decline in this segment. All product lines have been unfavorably impacted by the drop in activity, with production chemicals, deepwater operations and artificial lift showing the most resilience. Additionally, the reduced activity and well completion delays created an oversupply of hydraulic fracturing equipment, which caused the price deterioration in the onshore pressure pumping product line to be more severe. As such, we lost market share in this product line in 2015 as we worked to maintain cash flow positive operations despite an oversupplied market.\nNorth America loss before tax was $687 million in 2015, a decrease of $2.15 billion, or 147%, compared to profit before tax of $1.47 billion in 2014. The reduction in profitability was primarily due to the sharp decline in activity and an increasingly unfavorable pricing environment. Additionally, as a result of the industry downturn and its impact on our business, we incurred costs of $181 million in 2015 to write-down the carrying value of certain inventory. The impact from these unfavorable market conditions was partially mitigated by actions taken in the year to reduce our\nworkforce, close and consolidate facilities and improve commercial terms with vendors, which ultimately resulted in lower operating costs.\nLatin America\nLatin America revenue for 2015 was $1.80 billion, a decrease of $437 million, or 20%, compared to 2014. The reduction in this segment is attributed to activity declines across the region as a result of customer budgetary constraints, predominately in the Andean area where the rig count has declined 46%, and in Venezuela where we restructured our operational footprint in late 2014. This reduction was partially offset by revenue growth in Brazil from share gains in our drilling services product line.\nLatin America profit before tax decreased $156 million, or 54%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in profitability is mainly attributed to the decline in activity, foreign exchange losses, primarily in Argentina, and an increase in expense related to reserves for doubtful accounts. Additionally, we incurred costs of $13 million in 2015 to write-down the carrying value of certain inventory. This was partially offset by improvements made to our operational cost structure.\nEurope/Africa/Russia Caspian ( EARC\u201d)\nEARC revenue for 2015 was $3.28 billion, a decrease of $1.14 billion, or 26%, compared to 2014. The decrease was driven mainly by activity declines and unfavorable pricing across the region. Revenue was also negatively impacted by the unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates, which accounted for approximately one third of the revenue reduction in 2015. The deconsolidation of a joint venture in North Africa late last year also contributed to the decline in revenue. All product lines have been unfavorably impacted by the drop in activity and price, with production chemicals and drilling services showing the most resilience.\nEARC profit before tax decreased $464 million, or 75%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The unfavorable impact to profitability from pricing deterioration, lower activity levels, the change in foreign exchange rates, and increased costs related to reserves for doubtful accounts was partially offset by the savings from recent cost reduction measures. The unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates in 2015 accounted for approximately 40% of the decline in profitability. Also, 2014 included a $58 million charge associated with the restructuring of our operations in North Africa, and impairment of certain assets, that did not repeat in 2015.\nMiddle East/Asia Pacific ( MEAP\u201d)\nMEAP revenue for 2015 was $3.44 billion, a decrease of $1.02 billion, or 23%, compared to 2014. The revenue decline in this segment was driven primarily by lower activity across most of Asia, in particular China, Australia and Vietnam, and reduced revenue in Iraq. The revenue drop in Iraq is attributed to reduced activity, as evident by the 34% decline in rig count, and the rationalization of our operational footprint in the country, including completing our integrated operations activities. Revenue was also impacted by unfavorable pricing across the region.\nMEAP profit before tax decreased $471 million, or 70%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in profitability was driven largely by lower activity levels and unfavorable pricing. The current year also includes charges related to reducing our operations in Iraq. These reductions were partially offset by the benefit of the recent cost-saving actions.\nIndustrial Services\nIndustrial Services revenue was $1.22 billion, a decrease of $149 million, or 11%, compared to 2014. The decline in revenue in this segment was driven primarily by reduced activity and the unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates.\nIndustrial Services profit before tax decreased 18% in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in profitability resulting from lower activity levels was partially offset by cost-saving efforts. However, Industrial Services profit before tax for the prior year included integration costs related to the pipeline services business acquired in 2014, which we did not incur in 2015.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>2,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian\n</td> <td>4,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East/Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>4,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial Services\n</td> <td>1,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Profit Before Tax:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>339\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian\n</td> <td>621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East/Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial Services\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operations\n</td> <td>3,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>(544\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNorth America\nNorth America revenue in 2014 increased $1.2 billion or 11% compared to 2013, with rig counts increasing 6% from the prior year average. The increase in revenue was driven almost entirely by our U.S. onshore operations, where higher activity levels, improved utilization and market conditions in pressure pumping, along with increased demand for new technologies in the unconventional plays contributed to solid growth across all our districts and product lines. The largest contributor to the revenue growth was our pressure pumping operations, where market conditions gradually improved during the year, reversing the over supply of hydraulic fracturing equipment; which, when combined with our multi-year improvement initiative for this product line, resulted in improved utilization and increased efficiencies. Our artificial lift, drilling services and drill bit product lines also delivered exceptionally strong growth, as demand increased for our new technologies specifically designed for the unconventional plays. Revenue in Canada declined in 2014 as compared to 2013, in part due to a 6% decline in the oil-directed rig count, which is a significant driver of our operations in the country. Revenue in the Gulf of Mexico declined slightly despite a relatively flat rig count in 2014 compared to 2013. The revenue decline is attributable to activity delays, primarily in drilling and stimulation, that resulted from unusually strong ocean currents in the second half of 2014.\nNorth America profit before tax was $1,466 million in 2014, an increase of $498 million or 51% compared to 2013. In addition to the strong activity levels in U.S. onshore, increased profitability was driven by improved contractual terms and utilization in our pressure pumping operations, as well as other efficiency gains and cost savings recognized as part of our pressure pumping profit improvement plan. The growing demand for new technologies, which command a higher premium, also contributed to the improvement. In the Gulf of Mexico, profitability improved, despite the decline in revenue, as a result of a more favorable mix of revenue with an increase in deepwater completion systems. In Canada, profitability decreased in line with the revenue decline, as costs savings achieved in pressure pumping were offset by the foreign exchange impact of the weakening Canadian dollar. Profitability in 2014 was negatively impacted by $29 million of severance costs and $13 million of costs associated with a technology royalty agreement.\nLatin America\nLatin America revenue decreased $71 million or 3% in 2014 compared to 2013. Revenue reductions in Brazil and Venezuela were partially offset by increased revenue throughout the rest of the region. Revenue declined across most product lines in Brazil due to lower activity levels in 2014, as evidenced by a 27% reduction in the rig count compared to 2013. Revenue in Venezuela decreased across all product lines as a result of the devaluation of the Bolivares Fuertes relative to the U.S. Dollar\nLatin America profit before tax increased $224 million or 339% in 2014 compared to 2013. The significant improvement in profitability can be primarily attributed to cost reduction strategies implemented throughout the region in the second half of 2013, with particular focus on Brazil. 2013 includes a charge of $19 million for severance related to these actions. Increased activity in Argentina, Mexico and Ecuador also contributed to the profitability improvement in 2014. Profitability was also impacted by foreign exchange losses of $12 million and $23 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to the currency devaluation in Venezuela.\nEurope/Africa/Russia Caspian\nEARC revenue increased $376 million or 9% in 2014 compared to 2013. In 2014, we delivered strong revenue growth in Africa, Continental Europe and Russia Caspian. Revenue was negatively impacted by the unfavorable change in exchange rates of several currencies including the Russian Ruble relative to the U.S. Dollar. In Africa, revenue increased as a result of activity growth and share gains across most of the region, predominately in West Africa. These increases were slightly offset by activity declines in Libya due to political instability during the third quarter of 2014. In Continental Europe, revenue growth was driven by increased demand for our completion and production product lines. In the Russia Caspian region, revenue growth was driven by increased activity in our completion and production product lines.\nEARC profit before tax increased $30 million or 5% in 2014 compared to 2013. Incremental profitability growth from increased revenue was almost entirely offset by a $58 million charge associated with the restructuring of our operations in North Africa and impairment of certain assets, mainly due to the recent disruption in our operations in Libya. Profitability was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange losses as a result of the devaluation of several currencies, including the Russian Ruble.\nMiddle East/Asia Pacific\nMEAP revenue increased $597 million or 15% in 2014 compared to 2013, while the corresponding rig count increased only 7% over the same period. We posted strong revenue growth in virtually all geographies, most notably in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the Arabian Gulf, Southeast Asia and China. In Saudi Arabia, revenue increases were primarily related to activity growth in our integrated operations contracts. In addition, we experienced strong demand for our drilling services and completion services product lines. In Iraq, revenue increased in 2014 over the prior year, as 2013 was negatively impacted by a significant disruption in operations in the fourth quarter partially offset by a decline in activity in 2014 due to a demobilization on a major contract. Revenue increased in the Arabian Gulf due to increased demand for our drilling services and pressure pumping product lines in the United Arab Emirates and India. Within Asia Pacific, revenue growth was strongest in South East Asia and China, predominately in our drilling services product line.\nMEAP profit before tax improved $218 million or 48% in 2014 compared to 2013. The primary driver of the increase in profit before tax was higher incremental profit on increased revenue across the segment, most notably in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Further, we experienced a favorable shift in product mix with a higher proportion of revenue derived from our drilling services product line. Profit before tax in 2013 was negatively impacted by $79 million of losses in Iraq related to the significant disruption to our operations, expenses associated with personnel movements and security measures, and other non-recurring items.\nIndustrial Services\nIndustrial Services revenue increased 7% and profit before tax decreased 12% in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by the acquisition of a complementary pipeline services business in the\nthird quarter of 2014. Profitability in the segment decreased as a result of integration expenses related to this acquisition, along with an increase in environmental costs compared to the prior year.\nCosts and Expenses\nThe table below details certain data from our consolidated statements of income (loss) and as a percentage of revenue.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>14,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and engineering\n</td> <td>483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing, general and administrative\n</td> <td>1,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 92% and 80% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result of the steep decline in activity and customer spending, we experienced significant pricing pressure and a decline in the demand for our products and services. Despite actions to restructure our global operations to operate in a lower price and activity environment, the decline in revenue has outpaced the benefit of cost saving measures. Additionally, the product lines most significantly impacted by the downturn in rig activity are also the most capital-intensive. Accordingly, the fixed costs associated with those product lines lessened the positive impact of our cost reduction efforts in 2015. Cost of revenue for 2015 was also negatively impacted by a charge of $194 million to adjust the carrying value of certain inventory due to the industry-wide market decline, and $87 million of expenses related to the Merger.\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 80% and 83% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The improvement in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the continued improvement in our U.S. onshore pressure pumping business, which resulted in higher asset utilization and organizational efficiencies, as well as improved contractual terms. In Latin America, margins improved due to cost reduction strategies implemented throughout the region in the second half of 2013. Margins in the MEAP segment were improved by higher incremental profit on increased revenue, combined with a favorable shift in product mix. Reduced disruptions in our Iraq operations for 2014 also contributed to lower cost of revenue in the MEAP segment. In the EARC segment, profitability increased in Continental Europe, the United Kingdom and most of Africa but were partially offset by restructuring charges of $58 million associated with our operations in North Africa, primarily from disruptions in Libya. These improvements were partially offset by $113 million of increased depreciation expense across all segments except Latin America; $29 million of severance charges in North America; and $29 million of costs associated with a technology royalty agreement.\nResearch and Engineering\nResearch and engineering expenses decreased 21% in 2015 compared to 2014, yet increased slightly as a percentage of revenue. The reduction in research and engineering expense was driven by cost reduction measures, partially offset by $17 million of expenses related to the Merger.\nResearch and engineering expenses increased 10% in 2014 compared to 2013 as we continued our commitment to invest in the research and product development required to meet our customers' need for innovative new products and emerging technologies, focusing on lowering the cost of well construction, optimizing well production and increasing ultimate recoveries. As a result of our research and development activities in 2014, we commercially launched over 160 new products and services.\nMarketing, General and Administrative\nMarketing, general and administrative ( MG&A\u201d) expenses decreased 8% in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in MG&A costs is mainly a result of workforce reductions and lower discretionary spending. Included in MG&A expenses for 2015 are costs of $191 million related to the Merger, which partially offset the impact of the cost reduction measures.\nMG&A expenses decreased 3% in 2014 compared to 2013. MG&A expenses in 2014 includes a net gain of $34 million recognized on the deconsolidation of a jointly owned legal entity. Cost savings experienced across the organization were mostly offset by a charge of $14 million related to the impairment of a technology investment and $11 million of Merger related expenses. Also included in MG&A in 2014 and 2013 are foreign exchange losses of $12 million and $23 million, respectively, due to the currency devaluation in Venezuela.\nImpairment and Restructuring Charges\nDuring 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $830 million consisting of $436 million for workforce reduction costs, $121 million for contract termination costs and $273 million for asset impairments related to excess machinery and equipment and facilities. Total cash paid during 2015 related to these charges was $446 million. In addition to our restructuring activities, in response to the downturn in the energy market and its impact on our business outlook, we determined that the carrying amount of a number of our assets exceeded their respective fair values; therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.16 billion. These charges have been excluded from the results of our operating segments. For further discussion of these impairment and restructuring charges, see Note 3. Impairment and Restructuring Charges\u201d of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nThe reduction in costs from eliminating depreciation and reduced employee expenses in 2015 was approximately $700 million and is expected to be more than $1.6 billion on an annualized basis in 2016.\nLitigation Settlement\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a charge of $62 million related to previously disclosed litigation settlements for wage and hour lawsuits. A portion of this settlement was to be paid on a claims made basis and during the second quarter of 2015, the date passed by which the class members could file a claim under this provision of the settlement agreement. The amount of claims made was less than estimated and, accordingly, we reduced the accrual by approximately $13 million, which was recorded as an adjustment for litigation settlements during the second quarter of 2015.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income of $20 million, was $217 million in 2015, a decrease of $15 million compared to $232 million in 2014. The decrease is due primarily to lower short-term borrowings in Latin America and an increase in interest income. Interest expense, net of interest income of $13 million, remained relatively flat in 2014 when compared to $234 million in 2013.\nIncome Taxes\nTotal income tax benefit was $639 million in 2015 compared to income tax expense of $896 million and $612 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our effective tax rate on operating profits or losses in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 24.5%, 34.1% and 35.7%, respectively. The 2015 effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35% due to losses in foreign jurisdictions with no tax benefit and adjustments to prior years' tax positions, partially offset by favorable amended returns and other return to accrual adjustments. The 2014 effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35% due to lower rates on certain international operations, partially offset by state income taxes and adjustments to prior years' tax positions. The 2013 effective tax rate is higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35% due to higher rates on certain international operations, primarily resulting from foreign losses with no tax benefit, and state income taxes partially offset by adjustments to prior years' tax positions.\nCOMPLIANCE\nWe do business in more than 80 countries, including approximately 16 of the 40 countries having the lowest scores in the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index survey for 2015, which indicates high levels of corruption. We devote significant resources to the development, maintenance, communication and enforcement of our Business Code of Conduct, our anti-bribery compliance policies, our internal control processes and procedures and numerous other compliance related policies. Notwithstanding the devotion of such resources, and in part as a consequence thereof, from time to time we discover or receive information alleging potential violations of laws and regulations, including the FCPA and our policies, processes and procedures. We conduct timely internal investigations of these potential violations and take appropriate action depending upon the outcome of the investigation.\nWe anticipate that the devotion of significant resources to compliance-related issues, including the necessity for investigations, will continue to be an aspect of doing business in a number of the countries in which oil and natural gas exploration, development and production take place and in which we conduct operations. Compliance-related issues have, from time to time, limited our ability to do business or have raised the cost of operating in these countries. In order to provide products and services in some of these countries, we may in the future utilize ventures with third parties, sell products to distributors or otherwise modify our business approach in order to improve our ability to conduct our business in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and our Business Code of Conduct.\nOur Best-in-Class Global Ethics and Compliance Program (our Compliance Program\u201d) is based on (i) our Core Values of Integrity, Performance, Teamwork, Learning and Courage; (ii) the standards contained in our Business Code of Conduct; and (iii) the laws of the countries where we operate. Our Compliance Program is referenced within the Company as C2\u201d or Completely Compliant.\u201d The Completely Compliant theme is intended to establish the proper Tone-at-the-Top throughout the Company. Employees are consistently reminded that they play a crucial role in ensuring that the Company always conducts its business ethically, legally and safely.\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following:\n \u2022 We have comprehensive internal policies over such areas as facilitating payments; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations connected to non-U.S. government officials; payments to non-U.S. commercial sales representatives; and the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes. In addition, we have country-specific guidance for customs standards, visa processing, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions and antiboycott laws. \n \u2022 We have a comprehensive employee compliance training program covering substantially all employees. \n \u2022 We have a due diligence procedure for commercial sales, processing and professional agents and an enhanced process for classifying distributors. \n \u2022 We have continued our reduction of the use of commercial sales representatives and processing agents, including the reduction of customs agents. \n \u2022 We have a compliance governance committee, which includes senior officers of the Company, that reviews our effectiveness and compliance with processes and controls of the Company's global Compliance Program including all areas covered by the Business Code of Conduct. \n \u2022 We have a special compliance committee, which is made up of senior officers, that meets no less than once a year to review the oversight reports for all active commercial sales representatives. \n \u2022 We use technology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including a web-based antiboycott reporting tool and a global trade management software tool. \n \u2022 We have a program designed to encourage reporting of any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation including a worldwide business helpline operated by a third party and currently available toll-free in 150 languages to ensure that our helpline is easily accessible to employees in their own language. \n \u2022 We have a centralized finance organization including an enterprise-wide accounting system and company-wide policies. In addition, the corporate audit function has incorporated anti-corruption procedures in audits of certain countries. We also conduct FCPA risk assessments and legal audit procedures relating to third party commercial agents in non-U.S. jurisdictions. \n \u2022 We continue to work to ensure that we have adequate legal compliance coverage around the world, including the coordination of compliance advice and customized training across all regions and countries where we do business. \n \u2022 We have a centralized human resources function, including, among other things, consistent standards for pre-hire screening of employees, the screening of existing employees prior to promoting them to positions where they may be exposed to corruption-related risks, and a uniform policy for new hire training with a compliance component.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.32 billion, of which approximately $2.01 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries. A substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 was reinvested in our international operations as our intent is to use this cash to, among other things, fund the operations of our foreign subsidiaries. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., we may be required to provide taxes on certain of those funds based on applicable U.S. tax rates net of foreign tax credits. We have a committed revolving credit facility (the \"credit facility\") with commercial banks and a related commercial paper program under which the maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the credit facility and the commercial paper program is $2.50 billion. At December 31, 2015, we had no commercial paper outstanding; therefore, the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility as of December 31, 2015 was $2.50 billion. We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and the available credit facility, including the issuance of commercial paper, will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs. In 2015, we used cash to pay for a variety of activities including working capital needs, capital expenditures and payment of dividends.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(905\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,659\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(282\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities provided $1.80 billion and $2.95 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1.16 billion in 2015 primarily due to the decrease in net income after noncash charges, partially offset by the reduction in working capital (receivables, inventories and accounts payable), which provided more cash in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower activity levels. Additionally, the decrease in net income and market activity resulted in lower income taxes paid. Included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2015 are payments of $446 million made for employee severance and contract termination costs as a result of our restructuring activities initiated during the year.\nCash flows from operating activities provided $2.95 billion and $3.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $208 million in 2014 primarily due to the increase in working capital, which used more cash in 2014 compared to 2013, partially offset by the increase in net income. The main drivers of the increase in working capital were due to the increase in activity levels and the continuation of vendor management initiatives, partially offset by improved collections. Additionally, the increase in net income and market activity resulted in higher income taxes paid.\nInvesting Activities\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $965 million, $1.79 billion and $2.09 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decline in capital expenditures in 2015 is a result of lower demand for our products and services. While the majority of these expenditures were for machinery and equipment, it also includes expenditures for new facilities, expansions of existing facilities and other infrastructure projects.\nProceeds from the disposal of assets were $388 million, $437 million and $455 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These disposals related to equipment that was lost-in-hole and property, machinery, and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the year.\nIn 2015, we purchased short-term and long-term investment securities totaling $310 million. In 2014, we paid $314 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $7 million. Under the Merger Agreement with Halliburton, as described in Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, we have restrictions on our ability to acquire or dispose of any businesses while the Merger is pending.\nFinancing Activities\nWe had net repayments of commercial paper and other short-term debt of $45 million, $248 million and $571 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nTotal debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 was $4.04 billion, a decrease of $92 million compared to December 31, 2014. The total debt-to-capital (defined as total debt plus equity) ratio was 0.20 at December 31, 2015 and 0.18 at December 31, 2014. We received proceeds of $116 million, $216 million and $101 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase our common stock from time to time. During 2013, our Board of Directors increased the authorization to purchase our common stock under our share repurchase program by $800 million. During 2015, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. We had authorization remaining to repurchase approximately $1.05 billion in common stock at the end of 2015. During 2014, we repurchased 9.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $65.75 per share, for a total of $600 million. During 2013, we repurchased 6.3 million shares of our common stock at an average prices of $55.59 per share, for a total of $350 million.\nWe paid dividends of $297 million, $279 million and $267 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nUnder the Merger Agreement with Halliburton, as described in Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, we have generally agreed not to repurchase any shares of common stock or increase the quarterly dividend while the Merger is pending.\nAvailable Credit Facility\nAs discussed above, we have a committed revolving credit facility with commercial banks and a related commercial paper program under which the maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the credit facility and the commercial paper program is $2.5 billion. The credit facility matures in September 2016 and contains certain covenants which, among other things, restrict certain Merger transactions or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or a significant subsidiary and limit the amount of subsidiary indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the credit facility, covenant defaults and other customary defaults. We were in compliance with all of the credit facility's covenants, and there were no direct borrowings under the credit facility during 2015. Under the commercial paper program, we may issue from time to time up to $2.5 billion in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 270 days. The amount available to borrow under the credit facility is reduced by the amount of any commercial paper outstanding. At December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.\nIf market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility. However, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we would seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nWe believe our current credit ratings would allow us to obtain interim financing over and above our existing credit facility for any currently unforeseen significant needs.\nCash Requirements\nIn 2016, we believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and the available credit facility will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. If necessary, we may issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. In light of the current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2016 will be made as appropriate at a rate that we estimate would equal $450 million to $550 million on an annualized basis. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $300 million to $350 million in 2016. For all defined benefit, defined contribution and other postretirement plans, we expect to contribute between $245 million to $275 million to these plans in 2016. See Note 13. \"Employee Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion.\nIn May 2014, the Board of Directors approved a $0.02 per share increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per share of common stock for the August 2014 holders of record over the previous quarter's dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. We anticipate paying dividends in the range of $70 million to $78 million in the first quarter of 2016.\nUnder the Merger Agreement with Halliburton, as described in Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, we have agreed not to increase the quarterly dividend while the Merger is pending.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015. Certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual cash obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 - 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and capital lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>2,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td>590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities for uncertain income tax positions (5)\n</td> <td>312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including capital lease obligations. Amounts for debt do not include any unamortized discounts or deferred issuance costs. Expected cash payments for interest are excluded from these amounts. \n (2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. \n (3) Amounts represent the future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more. We enter into operating leases, some of which include renewal \noptions; however, we have excluded renewal options from the table above unless it is anticipated that we will exercise such renewals.\n (4) Purchase obligations include capital improvements as well as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. \n (5) The estimated income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions will be settled as a result of expiring statutes, audit activity, competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of litigation in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. The timing of any particular settlement will depend on the length of the tax audit and related appeals process, if any, or an expiration of a statute. If a liability is settled due to a statute expiring or a favorable audit result, the settlement of the tax liability would not result in a cash payment. \n (6) Amounts do not include expected contributions to our pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans of between $80 million to $95 million in 2016 as the majority of these contributions are amounts in excess of minimum funding requirements and as such would not be considered a contractual obligation.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than normal operating leases, as discussed above. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. The Audit/Ethics Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on the aging status of the customer accounts or when it becomes evident that the customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $383 million, or 11%, and $224 million, or 4%, of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our\nallowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required. A five percent change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would have had an impact on income before income taxes of approximately $19 million in 2015.\nInventory Reserves\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or market. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, inventory reserves totaled $278 million, or 9%, and $319 million, or 7%, of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required. A five percent change in this inventory reserve balance would have had an impact on income before income taxes of approximately $14 million in 2015.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nThe purchase price of acquired businesses is allocated to its identifiable assets and liabilities based upon estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired in a business acquisition. Our goodwill at December 31, 2015 and 2014, totaled $6.07 billion and $6.08 billion, respectively. We perform an annual test of goodwill for impairment as of October 1 of each year for each of our reporting units which are the same as our five reportable segments. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of performing a qualitative or quantitative assessment to determine if an impairment has occurred. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we would be required to perform a quantitative impairment test for goodwill. In 2015 and 2014, we performed a qualitative assessment for our annual goodwill impairment test. In 2013, a quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment was made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value.\nIn performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis for 2015, our qualitative assessment included consideration of current industry and market conditions and circumstances as well as any mitigating factors that would most affect the fair value of the Company and its reporting units. Among those mitigating factors, we considered the value of the consideration to be received at closing of the Merger, based on the terms of the Merger Agreement, compared to the carrying value of the Company and its reporting units. Based on our assessment and consideration of the totality of the facts and circumstances, including our business environment in the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company or any of its reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts. As such, no impairments of goodwill were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, or any of the prior years included in the accompanying financial statements.\nIn determining the carrying amount of reporting units, corporate and other assets and liabilities are allocated to the extent that they relate to the operations of those reporting units. When necessary, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit using various valuation techniques, including a market approach, a comparable transactions approach and discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") methodology. The market approach and comparable transactions approach provide value indications for a company through a comparison with guideline public companies or guideline transactions, respectively. Both entail selecting relevant financial information of the subject company, and capitalizing those amounts using valuation multiples that are based on empirical market observations. The DCF methodology includes, but is not limited to, assumptions regarding matters such as discount rates, anticipated growth rates, expected profitability rates and the timing of expected future cash flows. Unanticipated changes, including even small revisions, to these assumptions could result in a provision for impairment in a future period. In addition, a decline in our stock price could result in an impairment. Given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific assets and time-frames, it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions.\nLong-lived assets, which include property and equipment, intangible assets other than goodwill, and certain other assets, comprise a significant amount of our total assets. We review the carrying values of these assets for impairment periodically, and at least annually for certain intangible assets or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. This requires us to make judgments regarding long-term forecasts of future revenue and costs and cash flows related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions and technological developments.\nIncome Taxes\nThe liability method is used for determining our income tax provisions, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. These estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets. Historically, changes to valuation allowances have been caused by major changes in the business cycle in certain countries and changes in local country law. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions.\nWe operate in more than 80 countries under many legal forms. As a result, we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases, including actual income before taxes, deemed profits (which are generally determined using a percentage of revenue rather than profits) and withholding taxes based on revenue. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.\nOur tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts. We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. Resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty; accordingly, we provide taxes only for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings. The resulting change to our tax liability, if any, is dependent on numerous factors including, among others, the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities; the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process; the impartiality of the local courts; the number of countries in which we do business; and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce, or fail to produce, an offsetting tax change in other countries. Our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate. However, past experience is only a guide, and the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued.\nIn addition to the aforementioned assessments that have been received from various tax authorities, we also provide for taxes for uncertain tax positions where formal assessments have not been received. The determination of these liabilities requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events. Once established, we adjust these amounts only when more information is available or when a future event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves such as changes in the facts or law, judicial decisions regarding the application of existing law or a favorable audit outcome. We believe that the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on our\nconsolidated statements of income (loss) for a particular period and on our effective tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs.\nPensions and Postretirement Benefit Obligations\nPensions and postretirement benefit obligations and the related expenses are calculated using actuarial models and methods. This involves the use of two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected rate of return on assets, both of which are important elements in determining pension expense and in measuring plan liabilities. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually, and as necessary, we utilize third party actuarial firms to assist us. Although considered less critical, other assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and related expenses, such as demographic factors like retirement age, mortality and turnover, are also evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our actual and expected experience.\nThe discount rate enables us to determine expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. The development of the discount rate for our largest plans was based on a bond matching model whereby the cash flows underlying the projected benefit obligation are matched against a yield curve constructed from a bond portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income securities. Use of a lower discount rate would increase the present value of benefit obligations and increase pension expense. We used a weighted average discount rate of 3.6% in 2015, 4.5% in 2014 and 4.0% in 2013 to determine pension expense. A 50 basis point reduction in the weighted average discount rate would have increased pension expense and the projected benefit obligation of our principal pension plans by approximately $7 million and $85 million, respectively, in 2015.\nTo determine the expected rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected future returns on various categories of plan assets. A lower rate of return would decrease plan assets which results in higher pension expense. We assumed a weighted average expected rate of return on our plan assets of 6.8% in 2015, 6.7% in 2014 and 6.9% in 2013. A 50 basis point reduction in the weighted average expected rate of return on assets of our principal pension plans would have increased pension expense by approximately $7 million in 2015.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The ASU will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in U.S. GAAP and will require entities to recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The pronouncement is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2017. We have not completed an evaluation of the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-3, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We currently report debt issuance costs consistent with the guidance of this ASU; therefore there will be no impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures upon adoption.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-5, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. The ASU provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license and the related accounting treatment. The pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires inventory measured using the FIFO or average cost methods to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost or\nnet realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Currently, inventory measured using these methods is required to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost or market with market defined as replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin. This pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We have not completed an evaluation of the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We have not completed an evaluation of the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThere were no significant related party transactions during the three years ended December 31, 2015.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K, including MD&A and certain statements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a forward-looking statement\u201d).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBaker Hughes is a leading supplier of oilfield services, products, technology and systems use in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry, referred to as our oilfield operations. We manage our oilfield operations through four geographic segments consisting of North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian, and Middle East/Asia Pacific. Our Industrial Services businesses are reported in a fifth segment. As of December 31, 2015, Baker Hughes had approximately 43,000 employees compared to approximately 62,000 employees as of December 31, 2014.\nWithin our oilfield operations, the primary driver of our businesses is our customers' capital and operating expenditures dedicated to oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. The main products and services provided by oilfield operations fall into one of two categories, Drilling and Evaluation or Completion and Production. This classification is based on the two major phases of constructing an oil and/or natural gas well, the drilling phase and the completion phase, and how our products and services are utilized in each phase. We also provide products and services to the downstream chemicals, and process and pipeline services, referred to as Industrial Services.\n2015 was an extremely challenging year for the oil and natural gas industry. Crude oil prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 and experienced significant volatility in 2015, reaching a seven year low in December 2015 following OPEC's decision to eliminate its oil production ceiling. In response to the lower commodity prices in 2015, our customers curtailed their spending by reducing drilling activity in less economical unconventional plays and delaying well completion activities. As a result of these changes in market conditions and the significant decrease in activity and customer spending, we experienced a significant decline in demand and increased pricing pressure for our products and services.\nFor 2015, we generated revenue of $15.74 billion, a decrease of $8.81 billion, or 36%, compared to 2014. Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes was $1.97 billion for 2015 compared to net income attributable to Baker Hughes of $1.72 billion for 2014. The steep decline in activity, as evidenced by the 46% decline in the global rig count since the fourth quarter of 2014, and price deterioration experienced across all our segments is a large driver for the decline in revenue and profitability, most notably in North America. Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, we initiated actions to restructure and adjust our operations and cost structure to reflect reduced activity levels. As a result of these restructuring activities, we recorded charges totaling $830 million in 2015, which included workforce reductions, contract terminations, facility closures and the write-down of excess machinery and equipment. In addition to our restructuring activities, as a result of the downturn in the energy market and its impact on our business outlook, we determined that the carrying amount of certain assets exceeded their respective fair values; therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.16 billion. These charges have been excluded from the results of our operating segments.\nIn 2016, crude oil prices have continued to decline, reaching a twelve-year low in the first quarter. Although our visibility remains limited, we are expecting rig activity worldwide to continue to decline throughout the year and pricing pressures to continue across the globe. At current commodity prices, the global rig count could decline as much as 30% in 2016, as our customers' challenges of maximizing production, lowering their overall costs, and protecting cash flows are now more acute. Our products and services put us in an excellent position to help our customers achieve their business objectives and to capitalize on opportunities to continue to convert our capabilities into earnings. While targeting these opportunities, we remain focused on generating positive cash flow by proactively managing our cost structure, reducing our working capital, and maximizing return on invested capital.\nHalliburton Merger Agreement\nOn November 16, 2014, Baker Hughes and Halliburton entered into a definitive agreement and plan of Merger under which Halliburton will acquire all outstanding shares of Baker Hughes in a stock and cash transaction. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock of Baker Hughes will be converted into the right to receive 1.12 Halliburton shares plus $19.00 in cash. On March 27, 2015, Halliburton's stockholders approved the proposal to issue shares of Halliburton common stock as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In addition, Baker Hughes' stockholders adopted the Merger Agreement and thereby approved the proposed combination of the two companies. The transaction is still subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. In that regard, Baker Hughes and Halliburton have agreed to extend the period for the parties to obtain required competition approvals to April 30, 2016, as permitted under the Merger Agreement, and remain focused on completing the transaction as early as possible in 2016. However, Baker Hughes cannot predict with certainty when, or if, the pending Merger will be completed because completion of the transaction is subject to conditions beyond the control of Baker Hughes. For further information about the Merger, see Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nWe operate in more than 80 countries helping customers find, evaluate, drill, produce, transport and process hydrocarbon resources. Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is dependent on a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\n\n (1) Bloomberg Dated Brent ( Brent\u201d) Oil Spot Price per Barrel \n (2) Bloomberg West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) Cushing Crude Oil Spot Price per Barrel \n (3) Bloomberg Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit  Outside North America, customer spending is most heavily influenced by Brent oil prices, which fluctuated significantly throughout the year, ranging from a high of $66.37/Bbl in May 2015 to a low of $34.78/Bbl in December 2015. Oil prices started to decline at the end of 2014 and continued to be volatile throughout the first half of 2015 as the market experienced a significant over supply of capacity. In the second half of 2015, and continuing into the first quarter of 2016, oil prices began to steadily decline again as rapidly increasing production, primarily from OPEC countries, coupled with unfavorable economic data from Europe and Asia, reignited fears of a long-term market imbalance. OPEC's decision in the fourth quarter to eliminate its official oil production ceiling, despite lower oil prices, put additional downward pressure on price expectations, and as a result, Brent oil prices approached seven-year lows and exited 2015 reflecting a 46% reduction compared to the peak earlier in the year.\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which, similar to Brent oil prices, fluctuated significantly throughout the year, with the highest prices being recorded in the second quarter. Overall, WTI oil prices ranged from a high of $61.43/Bbl in June 2015 to a low of $34.73/Bbl in December 2015.\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $2.61/mmBtu in 2015, representing a 40% decrease over the prior year and the lowest annual average since 1999. Natural gas prices began 2015 supported by a colder than normal winter but fell throughout the year as production and storage inventories hit record levels despite a significant decline in the natural gas-directed rig count. In the fourth quarter of 2015, above average temperatures and forecasts of a warmer winter in the U.S. drove natural gas prices to further decline reaching a low of $1.53/mmBtu in December. According to the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE\u201d), working natural gas in storage at the end of 2015 was 3,756 billion cubic feet (\"Bcf\"), which was 16.7%, or 536 Bcf, above the corresponding week in 2014.\nBaker Hughes Rig Count\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are governed by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and gas. Therefore, the counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity. However, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nBaker Hughes has been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and/or other outside sources. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable; however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as Russia, the Caspian region, Iran and onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities, including production testing, completion and workover, or are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\n\n2015 Compared to 2014\nThe rig count in North America decreased 47% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by a 52% decline in oil-directed rigs, as a result of reduced spending from our customers as they adapt to a lower oil price environment. The oil-directed rig count decreased 51% in the U.S. as lower WTI prices have forced operators to reduce their exploration and development spending in order to protect their cash flows, as they focus more on production optimization opportunities. In Canada, the oil-directed rig count has decreased by 61% as many operators curtailed their drilling plans as most heavy oil sands projects are not economical at current oil prices. The natural gas-directed rig count in North America declined 32% in 2015 as natural gas prices deteriorated 40% compared to the 2014 average, with natural gas-directed drilling declining 32% in the U.S. and 33% in Canada.\nOutside North America, the rig count decreased 13% in 2015 compared to 2014, also driven by reduced customer spending and a lower oil price environment. The rig count in Latin America decreased 20% as a result of customer budgetary constraints across most of the region, primarily in Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador. The one exception was in the emerging unconventional plays in Argentina where activity remained relatively stable in 2015. The North Sea rig count decreased by 7%, largely due to a decline in the drilling activity in the Netherlands. The rig count in Continental Europe decreased by 24%, mainly as a result of reduced drilling in Turkey and Romania. In Africa, the rig count decreased 21%, predominantly due to reduced customer spending across the majority of the region, particularly in Libya, Chad, Angola, and Nigeria. The 2015 rig count in the Middle East remained unchanged from 2014 as activity declines in Iraq and Egypt were offset by increased activity in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait. The rig count in Asia Pacific decreased 13% as a consequence of reduced drilling activity primarily in India, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe rig count in North America increased 6% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily driven by a 9% growth in oil-directed rigs. The oil-directed rig count increased 11% in the U.S. as a result of increased exploration and production spending, but decreased by 6% in Canada where many operators curtailed their oil-directed drilling plans in the second half of 2014 due to high oil price differentials as compared to WTI and wet weather in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. The natural gas-directed rig count in North America declined 2% reflecting a 13% decrease in the U.S. partially offset by a 34% increase in Canada. Natural gas-directed drilling in the U.S. was negatively impacted by the continued weakness in North America natural gas prices which discouraged new investment in natural gas fields. In Canada, the increase in natural gas-directed rigs was driven by drilling in condensate rich zones in Alberta to service the oil sands drilling activity. Overall, Canada rig counts increased 7% in 2014 compared to 2013.\nOutside North America, the rig count increased 3% in 2014 compared to 2013. The rig count in Latin America decreased 5% as a result of reduced rig activity in Brazil and Mexico, partially offset by an increase in activity in the emerging unconventional plays in Argentina. The North Sea rig count decreased by 5%, primarily due to a decline in the rig activity in Norway. The rig count in Continental Europe increased by 13% with higher activity in Turkey and Romania. In Africa, the rig count increased 7% primarily due to higher activity in Kenya, Angola, and Chad. The rig count increased 9% in the Middle East due to higher activity in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait, slightly offset by a reduction in Iraq due to political unrest. The rig count in Asia Pacific increased 3% due to increased activity in offshore China, partially offset by activity reduction in Indonesia, Malaysia and New Zealand.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated.\nRevenue and Profit Before Tax\nRevenue and profit (loss) before tax for each of our five operating segments is provided below. The performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on profit or loss before tax, which is defined as income or loss before income taxes and before the following: net interest expense, corporate expenses, and certain gains and losses, including impairment and restructuring charges, not allocated to the operating segments.\n2015 Compared to 2014\n\n\nNorth America\nNorth America revenue for 2015 was $6.01 billion, a decrease of $6.07 billion, or 50%, compared to 2014. The steep reduction in commodity prices experienced by the industry in 2015 severely impacted onshore North America exploration and production companies as a result of the higher lifting cost per barrel of many of these producers. These operators have addressed these cash constraints by reducing drilling activity in less economical unconventional plays, delaying well completion activities, and driving price discounts from their service providers as they await higher commodity prices. These lower activity levels, as evident in the 47% rig count drop, and deteriorating pricing conditions were the main drivers for the revenue decline in this segment. All product lines have been unfavorably impacted by the drop in activity, with production chemicals, deepwater operations and artificial lift showing the most resilience. Additionally, the reduced activity and well completion delays created an oversupply of hydraulic fracturing equipment, which caused the price deterioration in the onshore pressure pumping product line to be more severe. As such, we lost market share in this product line in 2015 as we worked to maintain cash flow positive operations despite an oversupplied market.\nNorth America loss before tax was $687 million in 2015, a decrease of $2.15 billion, or 147%, compared to profit before tax of $1.47 billion in 2014. The reduction in profitability was primarily due to the sharp decline in activity and an increasingly unfavorable pricing environment. Additionally, as a result of the industry downturn and its impact on our business, we incurred costs of $181 million in 2015 to write-down the carrying value of certain inventory. The impact from these unfavorable market conditions was partially mitigated by actions taken in the year to reduce our\nworkforce, close and consolidate facilities and improve commercial terms with vendors, which ultimately resulted in lower operating costs.\nLatin America\nLatin America revenue for 2015 was $1.80 billion, a decrease of $437 million, or 20%, compared to 2014. The reduction in this segment is attributed to activity declines across the region as a result of customer budgetary constraints, predominately in the Andean area where the rig count has declined 46%, and in Venezuela where we restructured our operational footprint in late 2014. This reduction was partially offset by revenue growth in Brazil from share gains in our drilling services product line.\nLatin America profit before tax decreased $156 million, or 54%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in profitability is mainly attributed to the decline in activity, foreign exchange losses, primarily in Argentina, and an increase in expense related to reserves for doubtful accounts. Additionally, we incurred costs of $13 million in 2015 to write-down the carrying value of certain inventory. This was partially offset by improvements made to our operational cost structure.\nEurope/Africa/Russia Caspian ( EARC\u201d)\nEARC revenue for 2015 was $3.28 billion, a decrease of $1.14 billion, or 26%, compared to 2014. The decrease was driven mainly by activity declines and unfavorable pricing across the region. Revenue was also negatively impacted by the unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates, which accounted for approximately one third of the revenue reduction in 2015. The deconsolidation of a joint venture in North Africa late last year also contributed to the decline in revenue. All product lines have been unfavorably impacted by the drop in activity and price, with production chemicals and drilling services showing the most resilience.\nEARC profit before tax decreased $464 million, or 75%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The unfavorable impact to profitability from pricing deterioration, lower activity levels, the change in foreign exchange rates, and increased costs related to reserves for doubtful accounts was partially offset by the savings from recent cost reduction measures. The unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates in 2015 accounted for approximately 40% of the decline in profitability. Also, 2014 included a $58 million charge associated with the restructuring of our operations in North Africa, and impairment of certain assets, that did not repeat in 2015.\nMiddle East/Asia Pacific ( MEAP\u201d)\nMEAP revenue for 2015 was $3.44 billion, a decrease of $1.02 billion, or 23%, compared to 2014. The revenue decline in this segment was driven primarily by lower activity across most of Asia, in particular China, Australia and Vietnam, and reduced revenue in Iraq. The revenue drop in Iraq is attributed to reduced activity, as evident by the 34% decline in rig count, and the rationalization of our operational footprint in the country, including completing our integrated operations activities. Revenue was also impacted by unfavorable pricing across the region.\nMEAP profit before tax decreased $471 million, or 70%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in profitability was driven largely by lower activity levels and unfavorable pricing. The current year also includes charges related to reducing our operations in Iraq. These reductions were partially offset by the benefit of the recent cost-saving actions.\nIndustrial Services\nIndustrial Services revenue was $1.22 billion, a decrease of $149 million, or 11%, compared to 2014. The decline in revenue in this segment was driven primarily by reduced activity and the unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates.\nIndustrial Services profit before tax decreased 18% in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in profitability resulting from lower activity levels was partially offset by cost-saving efforts. However, Industrial Services profit before tax for the prior year included integration costs related to the pipeline services business acquired in 2014, which we did not incur in 2015.\n2014 Compared to 2013\n\n\nNorth America\nNorth America revenue in 2014 increased $1.2 billion or 11% compared to 2013, with rig counts increasing 6% from the prior year average. The increase in revenue was driven almost entirely by our U.S. onshore operations, where higher activity levels, improved utilization and market conditions in pressure pumping, along with increased demand for new technologies in the unconventional plays contributed to solid growth across all our districts and product lines. The largest contributor to the revenue growth was our pressure pumping operations, where market conditions gradually improved during the year, reversing the over supply of hydraulic fracturing equipment; which, when combined with our multi-year improvement initiative for this product line, resulted in improved utilization and increased efficiencies. Our artificial lift, drilling services and drill bit product lines also delivered exceptionally strong growth, as demand increased for our new technologies specifically designed for the unconventional plays. Revenue in Canada declined in 2014 as compared to 2013, in part due to a 6% decline in the oil-directed rig count, which is a significant driver of our operations in the country. Revenue in the Gulf of Mexico declined slightly despite a relatively flat rig count in 2014 compared to 2013. The revenue decline is attributable to activity delays, primarily in drilling and stimulation, that resulted from unusually strong ocean currents in the second half of 2014.\nNorth America profit before tax was $1,466 million in 2014, an increase of $498 million or 51% compared to 2013. In addition to the strong activity levels in U.S. onshore, increased profitability was driven by improved contractual terms and utilization in our pressure pumping operations, as well as other efficiency gains and cost savings recognized as part of our pressure pumping profit improvement plan. The growing demand for new technologies, which command a higher premium, also contributed to the improvement. In the Gulf of Mexico, profitability improved, despite the decline in revenue, as a result of a more favorable mix of revenue with an increase in deepwater completion systems. In Canada, profitability decreased in line with the revenue decline, as costs savings achieved in pressure pumping were offset by the foreign exchange impact of the weakening Canadian dollar. Profitability in 2014 was negatively impacted by $29 million of severance costs and $13 million of costs associated with a technology royalty agreement.\nLatin America\nLatin America revenue decreased $71 million or 3% in 2014 compared to 2013. Revenue reductions in Brazil and Venezuela were partially offset by increased revenue throughout the rest of the region. Revenue declined across most product lines in Brazil due to lower activity levels in 2014, as evidenced by a 27% reduction in the rig count compared to 2013. Revenue in Venezuela decreased across all product lines as a result of the devaluation of the Bolivares Fuertes relative to the U.S. Dollar\nLatin America profit before tax increased $224 million or 339% in 2014 compared to 2013. The significant improvement in profitability can be primarily attributed to cost reduction strategies implemented throughout the region in the second half of 2013, with particular focus on Brazil. 2013 includes a charge of $19 million for severance related to these actions. Increased activity in Argentina, Mexico and Ecuador also contributed to the profitability improvement in 2014. Profitability was also impacted by foreign exchange losses of $12 million and $23 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to the currency devaluation in Venezuela.\nEurope/Africa/Russia Caspian\nEARC revenue increased $376 million or 9% in 2014 compared to 2013. In 2014, we delivered strong revenue growth in Africa, Continental Europe and Russia Caspian. Revenue was negatively impacted by the unfavorable change in exchange rates of several currencies including the Russian Ruble relative to the U.S. Dollar. In Africa, revenue increased as a result of activity growth and share gains across most of the region, predominately in West Africa. These increases were slightly offset by activity declines in Libya due to political instability during the third quarter of 2014. In Continental Europe, revenue growth was driven by increased demand for our completion and production product lines. In the Russia Caspian region, revenue growth was driven by increased activity in our completion and production product lines.\nEARC profit before tax increased $30 million or 5% in 2014 compared to 2013. Incremental profitability growth from increased revenue was almost entirely offset by a $58 million charge associated with the restructuring of our operations in North Africa and impairment of certain assets, mainly due to the recent disruption in our operations in Libya. Profitability was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange losses as a result of the devaluation of several currencies, including the Russian Ruble.\nMiddle East/Asia Pacific\nMEAP revenue increased $597 million or 15% in 2014 compared to 2013, while the corresponding rig count increased only 7% over the same period. We posted strong revenue growth in virtually all geographies, most notably in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the Arabian Gulf, Southeast Asia and China. In Saudi Arabia, revenue increases were primarily related to activity growth in our integrated operations contracts. In addition, we experienced strong demand for our drilling services and completion services product lines. In Iraq, revenue increased in 2014 over the prior year, as 2013 was negatively impacted by a significant disruption in operations in the fourth quarter partially offset by a decline in activity in 2014 due to a demobilization on a major contract. Revenue increased in the Arabian Gulf due to increased demand for our drilling services and pressure pumping product lines in the United Arab Emirates and India. Within Asia Pacific, revenue growth was strongest in South East Asia and China, predominately in our drilling services product line.\nMEAP profit before tax improved $218 million or 48% in 2014 compared to 2013. The primary driver of the increase in profit before tax was higher incremental profit on increased revenue across the segment, most notably in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Further, we experienced a favorable shift in product mix with a higher proportion of revenue derived from our drilling services product line. Profit before tax in 2013 was negatively impacted by $79 million of losses in Iraq related to the significant disruption to our operations, expenses associated with personnel movements and security measures, and other non-recurring items.\nIndustrial Services\nIndustrial Services revenue increased 7% and profit before tax decreased 12% in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by the acquisition of a complementary pipeline services business in the\nthird quarter of 2014. Profitability in the segment decreased as a result of integration expenses related to this acquisition, along with an increase in environmental costs compared to the prior year.\nCosts and Expenses\nThe table below details certain data from our consolidated statements of income (loss) and as a percentage of revenue.\n\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 92% and 80% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result of the steep decline in activity and customer spending, we experienced significant pricing pressure and a decline in the demand for our products and services. Despite actions to restructure our global operations to operate in a lower price and activity environment, the decline in revenue has outpaced the benefit of cost saving measures. Additionally, the product lines most significantly impacted by the downturn in rig activity are also the most capital-intensive. Accordingly, the fixed costs associated with those product lines lessened the positive impact of our cost reduction efforts in 2015. Cost of revenue for 2015 was also negatively impacted by a charge of $194 million to adjust the carrying value of certain inventory due to the industry-wide market decline, and $87 million of expenses related to the Merger.\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 80% and 83% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The improvement in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the continued improvement in our U.S. onshore pressure pumping business, which resulted in higher asset utilization and organizational efficiencies, as well as improved contractual terms. In Latin America, margins improved due to cost reduction strategies implemented throughout the region in the second half of 2013. Margins in the MEAP segment were improved by higher incremental profit on increased revenue, combined with a favorable shift in product mix. Reduced disruptions in our Iraq operations for 2014 also contributed to lower cost of revenue in the MEAP segment. In the EARC segment, profitability increased in Continental Europe, the United Kingdom and most of Africa but were partially offset by restructuring charges of $58 million associated with our operations in North Africa, primarily from disruptions in Libya. These improvements were partially offset by $113 million of increased depreciation expense across all segments except Latin America; $29 million of severance charges in North America; and $29 million of costs associated with a technology royalty agreement.\nResearch and Engineering\nResearch and engineering expenses decreased 21% in 2015 compared to 2014, yet increased slightly as a percentage of revenue. The reduction in research and engineering expense was driven by cost reduction measures, partially offset by $17 million of expenses related to the Merger.\nResearch and engineering expenses increased 10% in 2014 compared to 2013 as we continued our commitment to invest in the research and product development required to meet our customers' need for innovative new products and emerging technologies, focusing on lowering the cost of well construction, optimizing well production and increasing ultimate recoveries. As a result of our research and development activities in 2014, we commercially launched over 160 new products and services.\nMarketing, General and Administrative\nMarketing, general and administrative ( MG&A\u201d) expenses decreased 8% in 2015 compared to 2014. The reduction in MG&A costs is mainly a result of workforce reductions and lower discretionary spending. Included in MG&A expenses for 2015 are costs of $191 million related to the Merger, which partially offset the impact of the cost reduction measures.\nMG&A expenses decreased 3% in 2014 compared to 2013. MG&A expenses in 2014 includes a net gain of $34 million recognized on the deconsolidation of a jointly owned legal entity. Cost savings experienced across the organization were mostly offset by a charge of $14 million related to the impairment of a technology investment and $11 million of Merger related expenses. Also included in MG&A in 2014 and 2013 are foreign exchange losses of $12 million and $23 million, respectively, due to the currency devaluation in Venezuela.\nImpairment and Restructuring Charges\nDuring 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $830 million consisting of $436 million for workforce reduction costs, $121 million for contract termination costs and $273 million for asset impairments related to excess machinery and equipment and facilities. Total cash paid during 2015 related to these charges was $446 million. In addition to our restructuring activities, in response to the downturn in the energy market and its impact on our business outlook, we determined that the carrying amount of a number of our assets exceeded their respective fair values; therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.16 billion. These charges have been excluded from the results of our operating segments. For further discussion of these impairment and restructuring charges, see Note 3. Impairment and Restructuring Charges\u201d of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nThe reduction in costs from eliminating depreciation and reduced employee expenses in 2015 was approximately $700 million and is expected to be more than $1.6 billion on an annualized basis in 2016.\nLitigation Settlement\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a charge of $62 million related to previously disclosed litigation settlements for wage and hour lawsuits. A portion of this settlement was to be paid on a claims made basis and during the second quarter of 2015, the date passed by which the class members could file a claim under this provision of the settlement agreement. The amount of claims made was less than estimated and, accordingly, we reduced the accrual by approximately $13 million, which was recorded as an adjustment for litigation settlements during the second quarter of 2015.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income of $20 million, was $217 million in 2015, a decrease of $15 million compared to $232 million in 2014. The decrease is due primarily to lower short-term borrowings in Latin America and an increase in interest income. Interest expense, net of interest income of $13 million, remained relatively flat in 2014 when compared to $234 million in 2013.\nIncome Taxes\nTotal income tax benefit was $639 million in 2015 compared to income tax expense of $896 million and $612 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our effective tax rate on operating profits or losses in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 24.5%, 34.1% and 35.7%, respectively. The 2015 effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35% due to losses in foreign jurisdictions with no tax benefit and adjustments to prior years' tax positions, partially offset by favorable amended returns and other return to accrual adjustments. The 2014 effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35% due to lower rates on certain international operations, partially offset by state income taxes and adjustments to prior years' tax positions. The 2013 effective tax rate is higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35% due to higher rates on certain international operations, primarily resulting from foreign losses with no tax benefit, and state income taxes partially offset by adjustments to prior years' tax positions.\nCOMPLIANCE\nWe do business in more than 80 countries, including approximately 16 of the 40 countries having the lowest scores in the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index survey for 2015, which indicates high levels of corruption. We devote significant resources to the development, maintenance, communication and enforcement of our Business Code of Conduct, our anti-bribery compliance policies, our internal control processes and procedures and numerous other compliance related policies. Notwithstanding the devotion of such resources, and in part as a consequence thereof, from time to time we discover or receive information alleging potential violations of laws and regulations, including the FCPA and our policies, processes and procedures. We conduct timely internal investigations of these potential violations and take appropriate action depending upon the outcome of the investigation.\nWe anticipate that the devotion of significant resources to compliance-related issues, including the necessity for investigations, will continue to be an aspect of doing business in a number of the countries in which oil and natural gas exploration, development and production take place and in which we conduct operations. Compliance-related issues have, from time to time, limited our ability to do business or have raised the cost of operating in these countries. In order to provide products and services in some of these countries, we may in the future utilize ventures with third parties, sell products to distributors or otherwise modify our business approach in order to improve our ability to conduct our business in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and our Business Code of Conduct.\nOur Best-in-Class Global Ethics and Compliance Program (our Compliance Program\u201d) is based on (i) our Core Values of Integrity, Performance, Teamwork, Learning and Courage; (ii) the standards contained in our Business Code of Conduct; and (iii) the laws of the countries where we operate. Our Compliance Program is referenced within the Company as C2\u201d or Completely Compliant.\u201d The Completely Compliant theme is intended to establish the proper Tone-at-the-Top throughout the Company. Employees are consistently reminded that they play a crucial role in ensuring that the Company always conducts its business ethically, legally and safely.\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following:\n \u2022 We have comprehensive internal policies over such areas as facilitating payments; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations connected to non-U.S. government officials; payments to non-U.S. commercial sales representatives; and the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes. In addition, we have country-specific guidance for customs standards, visa processing, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions and antiboycott laws. \n \u2022 We have a comprehensive employee compliance training program covering substantially all employees. \n \u2022 We have a due diligence procedure for commercial sales, processing and professional agents and an enhanced process for classifying distributors. \n \u2022 We have continued our reduction of the use of commercial sales representatives and processing agents, including the reduction of customs agents. \n \u2022 We have a compliance governance committee, which includes senior officers of the Company, that reviews our effectiveness and compliance with processes and controls of the Company's global Compliance Program including all areas covered by the Business Code of Conduct. \n \u2022 We have a special compliance committee, which is made up of senior officers, that meets no less than once a year to review the oversight reports for all active commercial sales representatives. \n \u2022 We use technology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including a web-based antiboycott reporting tool and a global trade management software tool. \n \u2022 We have a program designed to encourage reporting of any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation including a worldwide business helpline operated by a third party and currently available toll-free in 150 languages to ensure that our helpline is easily accessible to employees in their own language. \n \u2022 We have a centralized finance organization including an enterprise-wide accounting system and company-wide policies. In addition, the corporate audit function has incorporated anti-corruption procedures in audits of certain countries. We also conduct FCPA risk assessments and legal audit procedures relating to third party commercial agents in non-U.S. jurisdictions. \n \u2022 We continue to work to ensure that we have adequate legal compliance coverage around the world, including the coordination of compliance advice and customized training across all regions and countries where we do business. \n \u2022 We have a centralized human resources function, including, among other things, consistent standards for pre-hire screening of employees, the screening of existing employees prior to promoting them to positions where they may be exposed to corruption-related risks, and a uniform policy for new hire training with a compliance component.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.32 billion, of which approximately $2.01 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries. A substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 was reinvested in our international operations as our intent is to use this cash to, among other things, fund the operations of our foreign subsidiaries. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., we may be required to provide taxes on certain of those funds based on applicable U.S. tax rates net of foreign tax credits. We have a committed revolving credit facility (the \"credit facility\") with commercial banks and a related commercial paper program under which the maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the credit facility and the commercial paper program is $2.50 billion. At December 31, 2015, we had no commercial paper outstanding; therefore, the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility as of December 31, 2015 was $2.50 billion. We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and the available credit facility, including the issuance of commercial paper, will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs. In 2015, we used cash to pay for a variety of activities including working capital needs, capital expenditures and payment of dividends.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:\n\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities provided $1.80 billion and $2.95 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1.16 billion in 2015 primarily due to the decrease in net income after noncash charges, partially offset by the reduction in working capital (receivables, inventories and accounts payable), which provided more cash in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower activity levels. Additionally, the decrease in net income and market activity resulted in lower income taxes paid. Included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2015 are payments of $446 million made for employee severance and contract termination costs as a result of our restructuring activities initiated during the year.\nCash flows from operating activities provided $2.95 billion and $3.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $208 million in 2014 primarily due to the increase in working capital, which used more cash in 2014 compared to 2013, partially offset by the increase in net income. The main drivers of the increase in working capital were due to the increase in activity levels and the continuation of vendor management initiatives, partially offset by improved collections. Additionally, the increase in net income and market activity resulted in higher income taxes paid.\nInvesting Activities\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $965 million, $1.79 billion and $2.09 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decline in capital expenditures in 2015 is a result of lower demand for our products and services. While the majority of these expenditures were for machinery and equipment, it also includes expenditures for new facilities, expansions of existing facilities and other infrastructure projects.\nProceeds from the disposal of assets were $388 million, $437 million and $455 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These disposals related to equipment that was lost-in-hole and property, machinery, and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the year.\nIn 2015, we purchased short-term and long-term investment securities totaling $310 million. In 2014, we paid $314 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $7 million. Under the Merger Agreement with Halliburton, as described in Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, we have restrictions on our ability to acquire or dispose of any businesses while the Merger is pending.\nFinancing Activities\nWe had net repayments of commercial paper and other short-term debt of $45 million, $248 million and $571 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nTotal debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 was $4.04 billion, a decrease of $92 million compared to December 31, 2014. The total debt-to-capital (defined as total debt plus equity) ratio was 0.20 at December 31, 2015 and 0.18 at December 31, 2014. We received proceeds of $116 million, $216 million and $101 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase our common stock from time to time. During 2013, our Board of Directors increased the authorization to purchase our common stock under our share repurchase program by $800 million. During 2015, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. We had authorization remaining to repurchase approximately $1.05 billion in common stock at the end of 2015. During 2014, we repurchased 9.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $65.75 per share, for a total of $600 million. During 2013, we repurchased 6.3 million shares of our common stock at an average prices of $55.59 per share, for a total of $350 million.\nWe paid dividends of $297 million, $279 million and $267 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nUnder the Merger Agreement with Halliburton, as described in Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, we have generally agreed not to repurchase any shares of common stock or increase the quarterly dividend while the Merger is pending.\nAvailable Credit Facility\nAs discussed above, we have a committed revolving credit facility with commercial banks and a related commercial paper program under which the maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the credit facility and the commercial paper program is $2.5 billion. The credit facility matures in September 2016 and contains certain covenants which, among other things, restrict certain Merger transactions or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or a significant subsidiary and limit the amount of subsidiary indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the credit facility, covenant defaults and other customary defaults. We were in compliance with all of the credit facility's covenants, and there were no direct borrowings under the credit facility during 2015. Under the commercial paper program, we may issue from time to time up to $2.5 billion in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 270 days. The amount available to borrow under the credit facility is reduced by the amount of any commercial paper outstanding. At December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.\nIf market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility. However, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we would seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nWe believe our current credit ratings would allow us to obtain interim financing over and above our existing credit facility for any currently unforeseen significant needs.\nCash Requirements\nIn 2016, we believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and the available credit facility will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. If necessary, we may issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. In light of the current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2016 will be made as appropriate at a rate that we estimate would equal $450 million to $550 million on an annualized basis. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $300 million to $350 million in 2016. For all defined benefit, defined contribution and other postretirement plans, we expect to contribute between $245 million to $275 million to these plans in 2016. See Note 13. \"Employee Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion.\nIn May 2014, the Board of Directors approved a $0.02 per share increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per share of common stock for the August 2014 holders of record over the previous quarter's dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. We anticipate paying dividends in the range of $70 million to $78 million in the first quarter of 2016.\nUnder the Merger Agreement with Halliburton, as described in Note 2. \"Halliburton Merger Agreement\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, we have agreed not to increase the quarterly dividend while the Merger is pending.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015. Certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The contractual cash obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.\n\n (1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt, including capital lease obligations. Amounts for debt do not include any unamortized discounts or deferred issuance costs. Expected cash payments for interest are excluded from these amounts. \n (2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. \n (3) Amounts represent the future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more. We enter into operating leases, some of which include renewal \noptions; however, we have excluded renewal options from the table above unless it is anticipated that we will exercise such renewals.\n (4) Purchase obligations include capital improvements as well as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. \n (5) The estimated income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions will be settled as a result of expiring statutes, audit activity, competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of litigation in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. The timing of any particular settlement will depend on the length of the tax audit and related appeals process, if any, or an expiration of a statute. If a liability is settled due to a statute expiring or a favorable audit result, the settlement of the tax liability would not result in a cash payment. \n (6) Amounts do not include expected contributions to our pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans of between $80 million to $95 million in 2016 as the majority of these contributions are amounts in excess of minimum funding requirements and as such would not be considered a contractual obligation.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than normal operating leases, as discussed above. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.\nWe have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. The Audit/Ethics Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on the aging status of the customer accounts or when it becomes evident that the customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $383 million, or 11%, and $224 million, or 4%, of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our\nallowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required. A five percent change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would have had an impact on income before income taxes of approximately $19 million in 2015.\nInventory Reserves\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or market. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, inventory reserves totaled $278 million, or 9%, and $319 million, or 7%, of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required. A five percent change in this inventory reserve balance would have had an impact on income before income taxes of approximately $14 million in 2015.\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nThe purchase price of acquired businesses is allocated to its identifiable assets and liabilities based upon estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired in a business acquisition. Our goodwill at December 31, 2015 and 2014, totaled $6.07 billion and $6.08 billion, respectively. We perform an annual test of goodwill for impairment as of October 1 of each year for each of our reporting units which are the same as our five reportable segments. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of performing a qualitative or quantitative assessment to determine if an impairment has occurred. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we would be required to perform a quantitative impairment test for goodwill. In 2015 and 2014, we performed a qualitative assessment for our annual goodwill impairment test. In 2013, a quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment was made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value.\nIn performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis for 2015, our qualitative assessment included consideration of current industry and market conditions and circumstances as well as any mitigating factors that would most affect the fair value of the Company and its reporting units. Among those mitigating factors, we considered the value of the consideration to be received at closing of the Merger, based on the terms of the Merger Agreement, compared to the carrying value of the Company and its reporting units. Based on our assessment and consideration of the totality of the facts and circumstances, including our business environment in the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company or any of its reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts. As such, no impairments of goodwill were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, or any of the prior years included in the accompanying financial statements.\nIn determining the carrying amount of reporting units, corporate and other assets and liabilities are allocated to the extent that they relate to the operations of those reporting units. When necessary, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit using various valuation techniques, including a market approach, a comparable transactions approach and discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") methodology. The market approach and comparable transactions approach provide value indications for a company through a comparison with guideline public companies or guideline transactions, respectively. Both entail selecting relevant financial information of the subject company, and capitalizing those amounts using valuation multiples that are based on empirical market observations. The DCF methodology includes, but is not limited to, assumptions regarding matters such as discount rates, anticipated growth rates, expected profitability rates and the timing of expected future cash flows. Unanticipated changes, including even small revisions, to these assumptions could result in a provision for impairment in a future period. In addition, a decline in our stock price could result in an impairment. Given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific assets and time-frames, it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions.\nLong-lived assets, which include property and equipment, intangible assets other than goodwill, and certain other assets, comprise a significant amount of our total assets. We review the carrying values of these assets for impairment periodically, and at least annually for certain intangible assets or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. This requires us to make judgments regarding long-term forecasts of future revenue and costs and cash flows related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions and technological developments.\nIncome Taxes\nThe liability method is used for determining our income tax provisions, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. These estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets. Historically, changes to valuation allowances have been caused by major changes in the business cycle in certain countries and changes in local country law. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions.\nWe operate in more than 80 countries under many legal forms. As a result, we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases, including actual income before taxes, deemed profits (which are generally determined using a percentage of revenue rather than profits) and withholding taxes based on revenue. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.\nOur tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts. We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. Resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty; accordingly, we provide taxes only for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings. The resulting change to our tax liability, if any, is dependent on numerous factors including, among others, the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities; the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process; the impartiality of the local courts; the number of countries in which we do business; and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce, or fail to produce, an offsetting tax change in other countries. Our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate. However, past experience is only a guide, and the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued.\nIn addition to the aforementioned assessments that have been received from various tax authorities, we also provide for taxes for uncertain tax positions where formal assessments have not been received. The determination of these liabilities requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events. Once established, we adjust these amounts only when more information is available or when a future event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves such as changes in the facts or law, judicial decisions regarding the application of existing law or a favorable audit outcome. We believe that the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on our\nconsolidated statements of income (loss) for a particular period and on our effective tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs.\nPensions and Postretirement Benefit Obligations\nPensions and postretirement benefit obligations and the related expenses are calculated using actuarial models and methods. This involves the use of two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected rate of return on assets, both of which are important elements in determining pension expense and in measuring plan liabilities. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually, and as necessary, we utilize third party actuarial firms to assist us. Although considered less critical, other assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and related expenses, such as demographic factors like retirement age, mortality and turnover, are also evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our actual and expected experience.\nThe discount rate enables us to determine expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. The development of the discount rate for our largest plans was based on a bond matching model whereby the cash flows underlying the projected benefit obligation are matched against a yield curve constructed from a bond portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income securities. Use of a lower discount rate would increase the present value of benefit obligations and increase pension expense. We used a weighted average discount rate of 3.6% in 2015, 4.5% in 2014 and 4.0% in 2013 to determine pension expense. A 50 basis point reduction in the weighted average discount rate would have increased pension expense and the projected benefit obligation of our principal pension plans by approximately $7 million and $85 million, respectively, in 2015.\nTo determine the expected rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and target asset allocations, as well as historical and expected future returns on various categories of plan assets. A lower rate of return would decrease plan assets which results in higher pension expense. We assumed a weighted average expected rate of return on our plan assets of 6.8% in 2015, 6.7% in 2014 and 6.9% in 2013. A 50 basis point reduction in the weighted average expected rate of return on assets of our principal pension plans would have increased pension expense by approximately $7 million in 2015.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The ASU will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in U.S. GAAP and will require entities to recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The pronouncement is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2017. We have not completed an evaluation of the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-3, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We currently report debt issuance costs consistent with the guidance of this ASU; therefore there will be no impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures upon adoption.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-5, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. The ASU provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license and the related accounting treatment. The pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires inventory measured using the FIFO or average cost methods to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost or\nnet realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Currently, inventory measured using these methods is required to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost or market with market defined as replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin. This pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We have not completed an evaluation of the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We have not completed an evaluation of the impact the pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThere were no significant related party transactions during the three years ended December 31, 2015.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K, including MD&A and certain statements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a forward-looking statement\u201d).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\" This section includes an analysis of the company's financial performance, discussions about its operational segments, and details on its cash flow and liquidity position. It also presents a summary of the firm\u2019s revenue, costs, and profitability, and discusses the impact of external events, such as fluctuating oil prices, on its business.\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n- Baker Hughes is a leading provider of oilfield services and operates globally through several segments.\n- The company saw a significant decline in revenue and profitability in 2015 due to challenges in the oil and natural gas industry, illustrated by a sharp decrease in crude oil prices, volatility in the market, and reductions in customer spending. This led to downscaled drilling and well completion activities.\n- Revenue in 2015 was $15.74 billion, a 36% decrease from 2014; the company also recorded a net loss of $1.97 billion.\n- Baker Hughes took measures to restructure operations and reduce costs, including workforce reductions, facility closures, and write-down of assets.\n- In 2016, continued challenges are expected, including further decline in rig activity and pressure on pricing.\n- The Merger Agreement with Halliburton, if completed, would involve acquiring all outstanding shares of Baker Hughes.\n\n**Business Environment:**\n- Baker Hughes offers a variety of oilfield services globally and its revenues are largely influenced by customer expenditure on oil and natural gas exploration and production, which is impacted by factors like forecasting of energy demand, market access to resources, and expectations of oil and natural gas prices.\n- Oil and natural gas price volatility impacts revenue and operating expenses, as shown in detailed pricing tables.\n\n**Results of Operations:**\n- Financial results for North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian, Middle East/Asia Pacific, and Industrial Services are provided, highlighting the effects of market conditions on revenue and pre-tax profit.\n- Cost and expense structures are discussed, including the impact of cost of revenue, research and engineering costs, marketing costs, impairment and restructuring charges, as well as interest and income tax provisions.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources:**\n- Baker Hughes maintains financial flexibility with significant liquidity and access to a revolving credit facility.\n- The cash flow statement for 2015 shows cash generated from operations and used for investing and financing activities, with a reduction in capital expenditures due to market conditions.\n- The company has various contractual obligations, such as debt servicing, operating leases, and purchase obligations, and manages them within its liquidity strategy.\n\n**Critical Accounting Estimates:**\n- The report discusses the critical accounting estimates including provisions for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, goodwill and long-lived assets, income taxes, and pension and postretirement benefit obligations.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements:**\n- Provides a disclaimer about forward-looking statements that include forecasts on various aspects of the business, recognizing that actual results may vary based on various risks and uncertainties.\n\nOverall, the report indicates that Baker Hughes experienced a challenging year in 2015 and anticipates ongoing difficulties, but is taking strategic steps to manage its operations and finances, as well as a prospective merger with Halliburton."}
