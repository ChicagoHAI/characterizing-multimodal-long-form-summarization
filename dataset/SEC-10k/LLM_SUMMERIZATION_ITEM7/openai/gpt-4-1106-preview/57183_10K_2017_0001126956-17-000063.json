Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Dollars in millions, except per share and per unit amounts)\nINTRODUCTION\nThis section analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of Spire Inc. (Spire or the Company), Spire Missouri Inc. (Spire Missouri or the Missouri Utilities), and Spire Alabama Inc. (Spire Alabama). Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama, and Spire EnergySouth Inc. (Spire EnergySouth) are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. Spire Missouri changed its name from Laclede Gas Company on August 30, 2017, and Spire Alabama changed its name from Alabama Gas Corporation on September 1, 2017. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth Inc. (formerly known as EnergySouth, Inc.) are collectively referred to as the Utilities. The subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth are Spire Gulf Inc. (Spire Gulf, formerly known as Mobile Gas Service Corporation) and Spire Mississippi Inc. (Spire Mississippi, formerly known as Willmut Gas & Oil Company). This section includes management's view of factors that affect the respective businesses of the Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama, explanations of financial results including changes in earnings and costs from the prior periods, and the effects of such factors on the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's overall financial condition and liquidity.\nReference is made to Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe Company has two key business segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. Spire's earnings are primarily derived from its Gas Utility segment, which reflects the regulated activities of the Utilities. Due to the seasonal nature of the Utilities' business, earnings of Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are typically concentrated during the heating season of November through April each fiscal year.\nGas Utility - Spire Missouri\nSpire Missouri is Missouri's largest natural gas distribution utility and is regulated by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC). Spire Missouri serves St. Louis and eastern Missouri through Spire Missouri East (formerly Laclede Gas Company) and serves Kansas City and western Missouri through Spire Missouri West (formerly Missouri Gas Energy, or MGE). Spire Missouri delivers natural gas to retail customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the MoPSC. The earnings of Spire Missouri are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. The rate design for each service territory serves to lessen the impact of weather volatility on its customers during cold winters and stabilize Spire Missouri's earnings.\nGas Utility - Spire Alabama\nSpire Alabama is the largest natural gas distribution utility in the state of Alabama. Spire Alabama's service territory is located in central and northern Alabama. Among the cities served by Spire Alabama are Birmingham, the center of the largest metropolitan area in the state, and Montgomery, the state capital. Spire Alabama is regulated by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC). Spire Alabama purchases natural gas through interstate and intrastate suppliers and distributes the purchased gas through its distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and other end-users of natural gas. Spire Alabama also provides transportation services to large industrial and commercial customers located on its distribution system. These transportation customers, using Spire Alabama as their agent or acting on their own, purchase gas directly from marketers or suppliers and arrange for delivery of the gas into the Spire Alabama distribution system. Spire Alabama charges a fee to transport such customer-owned gas through its distribution system to the customers' facilities.\nGas Marketing\nSpire Marketing Inc. (Spire Marketing) is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related activities on a non-regulated basis and is reported in the Gas Marketing segment. Spire Marketing markets natural gas across the country with the core of its footprint located in and around the central United States (US). It holds firm transportation and storage contracts in order to effectively manage its customer base, which consists of producers, pipelines, power generators, storage operators, municipalities, utility companies, and large commercial and industrial customers.\nBusiness Evaluation Factors\nBased on the nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as current economic conditions, management focuses on the following key variables in evaluating the financial condition and results of operations and managing the business.\nGas Utility segment:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Utilities' ability to recover the costs of purchasing and distributing natural gas from their customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of weather and other factors, such as customer conservation, on revenues and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the regulatory environment at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as decisions by regulators, that impact the Utilities' ability to earn its authorized rate of return in all service territories they serve;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Utilities' ability to access credit markets and maintain working capital sufficient to meet operating requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the effect of natural gas price volatility on the business; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the ability to integrate the operations of all acquisitions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Gas Marketing segment:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the risks of competition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fluctuations in natural gas prices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>new national infrastructure projects;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the ability to procure firm transportation and storage services at reasonable rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>credit and/or capital market access;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>counterparty risks; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the effect of natural gas price volatility on the business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Further information regarding how management seeks to manage these key variables is discussed below.\nGas Utility\nThe Utilities seek to provide reliable natural gas services at a reasonable cost, while maintaining and building secure and dependable infrastructures. The Utilities' strategies focus on improving both performance and the ability to recover their authorized distribution costs and rates of return. The Utilities' distribution costs are the essential, primarily fixed, expenditures it must incur to operate and maintain more than 58,000 miles of mains and services comprising the natural gas distribution systems and related storage facilities for Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth.\nThe Utilities' distribution costs include wages and employee benefit costs, depreciation and maintenance expenses, and other regulated utility operating expenses, excluding natural and propane gas expense. Distribution costs are considered in the rate-making process, and recovery of these types of costs is included in revenues generated through the Utilities' tariff rates. Spire Missouri's tariff rates are approved by the MoPSC, whereas Spire Alabama's tariff rates are approved by the APSC. The subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi, have tariff rates that are approved by the APSC and Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC), respectively. Spire Missouri also has an off-system sales and capacity release income stream that is regulated by tariff.\nSpire Missouri's income from off-system sales and capacity release remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. Spire Missouri is allowed to retain the following portions of annual income (shown by service territory):\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Customer Share\n</td> <td>Company Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First $2.0 of pre-tax income*\n</td> <td>85%\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Next $2.0 of pre-tax income\n</td> <td>80%\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Next $2.0 of pre-tax income\n</td> <td>75%\n</td> <td>25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts of pre-tax income exceeding $6.0\n</td> <td>70%\n</td> <td>30%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>* Customer share was set to 85% and company share set to 15% in fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2016 and 2015, the customer share and company share were 100% and 0%, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First $1.2 of pre-tax income\n</td> <td>85%\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Next $1.2 of pre-tax income\n</td> <td>80%\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Next $1.2 of pre-tax income\n</td> <td>75%\n</td> <td>25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts of pre-tax income exceeding $3.6\n</td> <td>70%\n</td> <td>30%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSome of the factors impacting the level of off-system sales include the availability and cost of Spire Missouri's natural gas supply, the weather in its service area, and the weather in other markets. When Spire Missouri's service area experiences warmer-than-normal weather while other markets experience colder weather or supply constraints, some of Spire Missouri's natural gas supply is available for off-system sales.\nThe Utilities work actively to reduce the impact of wholesale natural gas price volatility on their costs by strategically structuring their natural gas supply portfolios to increase their gas supply availability and pricing alternatives. They may also use derivative instruments to hedge against significant changes in the commodity price of natural gas. Nevertheless, the overall cost of purchased gas remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. The Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf, and Spire Mississippi and Spire Alabama's Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider allow the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the public service commissions, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including costs, cost reductions, and related carrying costs associated with the use of derivative instruments to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas, as well as gas inventory carrying costs. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Missouri had active derivative positions, but Spire Alabama has had no gas supply derivative instrument activity since 2010. The Utilities believe they will continue to be able to obtain sufficient gas supply. The price of natural gas supplies and other economic conditions may affect sales volumes, due to the conservation efforts of customers, and cash flows associated with the timing of collection of gas costs and related accounts receivable from customers.\nThe Utilities rely on short-term credit and long-term capital markets, as well as cash flows from operations, to satisfy their seasonal cash requirements and fund their capital expenditures. The Utilities' ability to issue commercial paper, access their lines of credit, issue long-term bonds, or obtain new lines of credit is dependent on current conditions in the credit and capital markets. Management focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and believes it currently has adequate access to credit and capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources to meet their foreseeable obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information.\nGas Marketing\nSpire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and providing energy services to both on-system utility transportation customers and customers outside of the Utilities' traditional service areas. Spire Marketing utilizes its natural gas supply agreements, transportation agreements, park and loan agreements, storage agreements, and other executory contracts to support a variety of services to its customers at competitive prices. It closely monitors and manages the natural gas commodity price and volatility risks associated with providing such services to its customers through the use of a variety of risk management activities, including the use of exchange-traded/cleared derivative instruments and other contractual arrangements. Spire Marketing is committed to managing commodity price risk while it seeks to expand the services that it now provides. Nevertheless, income from the Gas Marketing operations is subject to more fluctuations in market conditions than the Utilities' operations.\nThe Gas Marketing business is directly impacted by the effects of competition in the marketplace, the impacts of new infrastructure, surplus natural gas supplies, and the addition of new demand from exports, power generation and industrial load. Spire Marketing's management expects a growing need for marketing services across the country as customers manage seasonal variability and marketplace volatility.\nIn addition to its operating cash flows, Spire Marketing relies on Spire's parental guarantees to secure its purchase and sales obligations of natural gas, and it also has access to Spire's liquidity resources. A large portion of Spire Marketing's receivables are from customers in the energy industry. It also enters into netting arrangements with many of its energy counterparties to reduce overall credit and collateral exposure. Although Spire Marketing's uncollectible amounts are closely monitored and have not been significant, increases in uncollectible amounts from customers are possible and could adversely affect Gas Marketing's liquidity and results of operations.\nSpire Marketing carefully monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its transactions. It performs in-house credit reviews of potential customers and may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit, or parental guarantees when appropriate. Credit limits for customers are established and monitored.\nAs a result of infrastructure optimization activities and an abundance of natural gas supply, Spire Marketing cannot be certain that all of its wholesale purchase and sale transactions will settle physically. As such, certain transactions are designated as trading activities for financial reporting purposes, due to their settlement characteristics. Results of operations from trading activities are reported on a net basis in Gas Marketing operating revenues (or expenses, if negative), which may cause volatility in the Company's operating revenues, but have no effect on operating income or net income.\nIn the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. In accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), some of its purchase and sale transactions are not recognized in earnings until the natural gas is physically delivered, while other energy-related transactions, including those designated as trading activities, are required to be accounted for as derivatives, with the changes in their fair value (representing unrealized gains or losses) recorded in earnings in periods prior to settlement. Because related transactions of a purchase and sale strategy may be accounted for differently, there may be timing differences in the recognition of earnings under GAAP and economic earnings realized upon settlement. The Company reports both GAAP and net economic earnings (non-GAAP), as discussed below.\nOther\nIn addition to the Gas Utility and Gas Marketing segments, other non-utility activities of the Company include:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Spire STL Pipeline, a subsidiary of Spire planning construction and operation of a proposed 65-mile Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulated pipeline to deliver natural gas into eastern Missouri; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Spire's subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline, compression of natural gas and risk management, among other activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEARNINGS\nNet income reported by Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama is determined in accordance with GAAP. Management also uses the non-GAAP financial measures of net economic earnings, net economic earnings per share and contribution margin when internally evaluating and reporting results of operations. These non-GAAP operating metrics should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, GAAP measures such as net income, earnings per share and operating income. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Net Economic Earnings and Net Economic Earnings Per Share\nNet economic earnings and net economic earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude from net income the after-tax impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions as well as acquisition, divestiture, and restructuring activities. These fair value and timing adjustments are made in instances where the accounting treatment differs from what management considers the economic substance of the underlying transaction, including the following:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives that are required by GAAP fair value accounting associated with current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. These unrealized gains and losses result primarily from two sources:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1)\n</td> <td>changes in the fair values of physical and/or financial derivatives prior to the period of settlement; and,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2)\n</td> <td>ineffective portions of accounting hedges, required to be recorded in earnings prior to settlement, due to differences in commodity price changes between the locations of the forecasted physical purchase or sale transactions and the locations of the underlying hedge instruments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lower of cost or market adjustments to the carrying value of commodity inventories resulting when the market price of the commodity falls below its original cost, to the extent that those commodities are economically hedged; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Realized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of economic hedges prior to the sale of the physical commodity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> These adjustments eliminate the impact of timing differences and the impact of current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in each period until being replaced with the actual gains or losses realized when the associated physical transactions occur. While management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate both the Utilities and non-utility businesses, the net effect of adjustments on the Utilities' earnings is minimal because gains or losses on their natural gas derivative instruments are deferred pursuant to state regulation.\nManagement believes that excluding the earnings volatility caused by recognizing changes in fair value prior to settlement and other timing differences associated with related purchase and sale transactions provides a useful representation of the economic effects of only the actual settled transactions and their effects on results of operations. In addition, management excludes the impact related to certain acquisition, divestiture, and restructuring activities when evaluating on-going performance, and therefore excludes these impacts from net economic earnings. Similarly, in fiscal years 2016, 2014 and 2013, net economic earnings per share excludes the impact of shares issued in those years to finance acquisitions that closed late in each fiscal year. Management believes that this presentation provides a useful representation of operating performance by facilitating comparisons of year-over-year results. The definition and measurement of net economic earnings provided above is consistent with that used by management and the Board of Directors in assessing the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's performance as well as determining performance under the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's incentive compensation plans. Further, the Company believes this better enables an investor to view the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's performance in that period on a basis that would be comparable to prior periods.\nReconciliations of net economic earnings and net economic earnings per share to the Company's most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages.\nNon-GAAP Measure - Contribution Margin\nIn addition to operating revenues and operating expenses, management also uses the non-GAAP measure of contribution margin when evaluating results of operations. The Utilities pass to their customers (subject to prudence review by, as applicable, the MoPSC, APSC, or MSPSC) increases and decreases in the wholesale cost of natural gas in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA rider. The volatility of the wholesale natural gas market results in fluctuations from period to period in the recorded levels of, among other items, revenues and natural gas cost expense. Nevertheless, increases and decreases in the cost of gas associated with system gas sales volumes and gross receipts tax expense (which are calculated as a percentage of revenues), with the same amount (excluding immaterial timing differences) included in revenues, has no direct effect on operating income. Contribution margin is defined as operating revenues less natural and propane gas costs and gross receipts tax expense. As these items are reflected in both operating revenue and operating expenses and management has little control over these amounts for the Utilities, management believes that contribution margin is a useful supplemental measure. In addition, it is management's belief that contribution margin and the remaining operating expenses that calculate operating income are useful in assessing the Company's and the Utilities' performance as management has more ability to influence control over these revenues and expenses.\nSpire\nOverview - Net Income (Loss)\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

Basic and diluted earnings per share were $3.44 and $3.43, respectively, for fiscal 2017 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $3.26 and $3.24, respectively, for fiscal 2016. Net economic earnings were $167.6 (or $3.56 per share) in fiscal 2017, compared with $149.1 (or $3.42 per share) in fiscal 2016, an increase of $18.5. Net income increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to $21.5 income growth in the Gas Utility segment, partly offset by a $3.7 income decline in the Gas Marketing segment and a $0.4 larger loss from other activities.\nGas Utility\nGas Utility net income and net economic earnings increased by $21.5 and $21.2, respectively, in fiscal 2017, compared to fiscal 2016. The increases to net income and net economic earnings were driven by the $9.6 income growth generated by the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, margin growth and combined lower O&M expenses at Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama. The margin growth was driven by higher Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS) charges at the Missouri Utilities and net favorable regulatory adjustments at Spire Alabama, partly offset by weather impacts resulting from warmer winter temperatures. These impacts were partly offset by increases in depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, interest expense was higher due to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition and higher interest charges experienced by Spire Missouri. Income taxes were also higher due to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition and higher pre-tax income for both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama. Further details are discussed in the Gas Utility, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama sections below.\nGas Marketing\nGas Marketing reported net income totaling $3.4, a decrease of $3.7 compared with the same period last year. Net economic earnings for fiscal 2017 increased $0.4 from fiscal 2016. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to unfavorable mark-to-market (MTM) activity in the current year. Net economic earnings benefited from increased value from spreads and asset optimization in the current year versus the prior year. Further details are discussed in the Gas Marketing section below.\nOther\nThe combined increase in net loss and net economic loss for the Company's other non-utility activities were $0.4 and $3.1, respectively, for fiscal 2017 compared to the same period last year. The increased loss was primarily the result of higher current year interest charges associated with the September 2016 acquisition of Spire EnergySouth.\nOperating Revenues and Operating Expenses\nReconciliations of contribution margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are shown below.

for $1,537.3 the same period last year. The increase was driven primarily by the Utilities, the result of the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, higher ISRS charges at Spire Missouri, favorable regulatory adjustments at Spire Alabama, and higher gas costs passed on to customers in both Missouri and Alabama. These positive drivers were partly offset by lower demand as a result of warmer weather. Spire's contribution margin increased $88.2 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher contribution margin of $94.6 for the Gas Utility segment, slightly offset by the lower contribution margin reported in Gas Marketing. Operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses increased $26.7 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the same period last year, as discussed below. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $16.6, driven principally by the Spire EnergySouth acquisition and continued infrastructure investment at Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama in fiscal 2017.\nGas Utility\nOperating Revenues - Gas Utility operating revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $208.5 compared to fiscal 2016, and was attributable to the following factors:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New customer revenue from Spire EnergySouth acquisition\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher wholesale gas costs passed on to customers\n</td> <td>87.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Alabama - Lower Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE) revenue reduction and higher Cost Control Measure (CCM) benefit\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri - Higher off-system sales and capacity release\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri - Higher ISRS charges\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher gross receipts tax\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weather / temperature adjustment impact\n</td> <td>(27.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Variation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContribution Margin - Gas Utility contribution margin was $939.0 for fiscal 2017, a $94.6 increase over the same period last year.

These positive impacts offset the negative impact of weather and temperature adjustments. Temperatures in the Spire Missouri territory experienced degree days that were 1% warmer than last year and 20% warmer than normal. Degree days in the Spire Alabama service areas in fiscal 2017 were 15% warmer than the prior year, and 35% warmer than normal. Temperatures are a significant part of the Utilities' rate cases, contributing to the constrained margins experienced in the current year.\nOperating Expenses - Depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $16.6 from the same period last year, $10.0 the result of the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, $4.5 due to Spire Missouri and $2.1 relating to Spire Alabama, principally the result of continued infrastructure capital spending in fiscal 2017. O&M expenses increased $29.8 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $33.5 increase relating to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, O&M expenses were $3.7 below prior year levels due primarily to lower employee-related costs that were only partly offset by higher professional services. The employee labor-costs were favorably impacted by the warmer weather experienced in both the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama service territories. Taxes other than income taxes were $12.6 higher in the current year, with $7.6 of the increase attributable to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition. $4.2 of the increase was related to the higher gross receipt taxes due to the higher revenues, with the remainder of the variance related to property tax expense at Spire Missouri.\nGas Marketing\nOperating Revenues - Gas Marketing operating revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $0.8 from the same period last year. The variance in revenues reflects the impact of higher total volumes and higher commodity pricing levels offset by the effect of increased trading activities, and unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives. Under GAAP, revenues associated with trading activities are presented net of related costs. Average pricing for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 was approximately $2.897/MMBtu versus approximately $2.286/MMBtu for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.611/MMBtu.\nContribution Margin - Gas Marketing contribution margin was $11.6 for fiscal 2017, a $6.1 decrease compared to the same period last year, with that variance significantly impacted by unfavorable fair value adjustments on derivative holdings in the current year, and favorable adjustments in the prior year. Removing these fair value adjustments from both periods, contribution margin is $0.7 higher than last year, reflecting favorable wholesale trading volumes and storage optimization.\nOther\nOther operating revenue increased $2.9 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, driven by higher reinsurance premiums. Other operating expenses were essentially flat with the prior year, as an increase in costs related to the reinsurance premiums was offset by a decrease in corporate-level integration expenses.\nInterest Charges\nConsolidated interest charges during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $11.9 versus the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by the debt incurred and assumed as a result of the Spire EnergySouth acquisition generating interest expense of $8.5, combined with marginally higher interest rates on floating rate debt in the first six months of the year and higher interest rates on the senior notes issued in March of this year that were used to retire the $250.0 of floating rate debt. Also, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, average short-term borrowings were $485.8 and $273.9, respectively, and the average interest rates on these borrowings were 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nConsolidated income tax expense increased $8.1 in fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The current year effective tax rate of 32.4% was essentially flat versus fiscal 2016's effective rate of 32.5%.\nSpire Missouri\nSummary Operating Results\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended September 30,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operation and maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>243.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>93.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Taxes, other than income taxes\n</td> <td>99.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Less: Gross receipts tax expense\n</td> <td>(60.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Contribution Margin (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>573.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>558.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Natural and propane gas costs\n</td> <td>538.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>471.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Gross receipts tax expense\n</td> <td>60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,171.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,087.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating revenues during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $84.4 from the same period last year.

Higher ISRS charges of $14.2 were only partly offset by a negative $2.6 weather impact attributable to the 1% warmer weather experienced in the current year.\nO&M for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 were $0.6 lower than the prior year. Lower employment-related costs were almost completely offset by higher professional services. Depreciation and amortization increased $4.5, reflecting continued infrastructure investments throughout Missouri. Interest expense in the current year was $1.7 greater than prior year, the result of a combination of higher short-term borrowings and higher average effective interest rates. Income taxes were $2.1 higher for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 versus the comparable prior year period due to higher pre-tax book income, mitigated by a slightly lower effective tax rate.\nTemperatures experienced in the Missouri Utilities' service area during fiscal 2017 were 1% warmer than the same period last year and 20% warmer than normal. Normal temperatures are part of Spire Missouri's rate case design, meaning the warmer than normal temperatures continued to constrain margins. Total system therms sold and transported were 1,482.1 million for fiscal 2017 compared with 1,479.3 million for fiscal 2016. Total off-system therms sold and transported outside of Spire Missouri's service area were 175.6 million for fiscal 2017 compared with 183.3 million for fiscal 2016.\nSpire Alabama\nSummary Operating Results\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended September 30,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operation and maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>130.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>49.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Taxes, other than income taxes\n</td> <td>29.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Less: Gross receipts tax expense\n</td> <td>(19.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Contribution Margin (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>296.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>283.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Natural and propane gas costs\n</td> <td>84.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Gross receipts tax expense\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>368.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $32.0 versus the comparable period ended September 30, 2016. Of the increase, $19.2 of the increase related to lower RSE return on equity revenue adjustments and higher CCM benefits in the current year, $11.2 resulted from weather/temperature adjustments, along with slightly higher gross receipts taxes of $1.6.\nContribution margin increased $13.2 versus prior year, as $19.2 in favorable RSE, CCM adjustments and return on capital more than offset negative weather and usage impacts of $6.0. Contributing to the favorable current year RSE return on equity adjustment impact was a fiscal 2016 reduction in revenues relating to a legal settlement of $6.0. There was no impact to net income, as this revenue adjustment offset a corresponding $6.0 gain recorded in other income.\nO&M expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 decreased $3.1 versus the year ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in other operating expenses was driven primarily by lower employee-related costs, which were favorably impacted by the warmer weather in the current year. Depreciation and amortization was $2.1 higher versus the same period last year, the result of continued infrastructure investment throughout Spire Alabama's service territory. Income tax expense increased $3.4, primarily due to the higher pre-tax book income earned in the current year.\nTemperatures in Spire Alabama's service area during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 were 35% warmer than normal and 15% warmer than the same period a year earlier. Spire Alabama's total therms sold and transported were 900.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017, compared with 878.1 million for the same period last year.\nFor further information on the GSA, RSE and CCM mechanisms, please see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 15, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Financial Statements.\n2016 vs. 2015\nSpire\nConsolidated\nSpire's net income was $144.2 in fiscal 2016, compared with $136.9 in fiscal 2015. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $3.26 and $3.24, respectively, for fiscal 2016 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $3.16 for fiscal 2015. Net economic earnings were $149.1 (or $3.42 per share) in fiscal 2016, compared with $138.3 (or $3.19 per share) in fiscal 2015. Net income increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to $5.7 income growth in the Gas Utility segment and $3.0 income growth in the Gas Marketing segment, partly offset by a $1.4 larger loss from other activities.\nGas Utility\nGas Utility net income and net economic earnings increased by $5.7 and $9.9, respectively, in fiscal 2016, compared to 2015. The increases to net income and net economic earnings were driven by higher ISRS charges at Spire Missouri and net favorable regulatory adjustments at Spire Alabama, partly offset by lower volumes resulting from warmer winter temperatures. The segment also benefited from a decrease in O&M, which includes effects of the warmer weather. These impacts were partly offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, interest expense was higher due to the increase experienced by Spire Missouri. Income taxes were also higher due to higher pre-tax income for both the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama.\nGas Marketing\nGas Marketing reported net income totaling $7.1 in fiscal 2016, an increase of $3.0 compared to fiscal 2015. Net economic earnings for fiscal 2016 increased $2.2 from fiscal 2015. The increases in net income and net economic earnings were primarily attributable to increases in contribution margin, with the impact to net economic earnings being partly offset by mark-to-market activity as discussed in the Gas Marketing section below.\nOther\nThe combined increase in net loss and net economic loss for the Company's other non-utility activities were $1.4 and $1.3, respectively, for fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of higher interest charges.\nOperating Revenues and Operating Expenses\nReconciliations of the Company's contribution margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are shown above.\nConsolidated\nSpire reported operating revenues of $1,537.3 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared with $1,976.4 for the same prior year period. The decrease was driven primarily by the Utilities, the result of lower volumes and lower gas costs passed on to customers. Spire's contribution margin increased $7.1 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher contribution margin of $5.0 and $2.3 for the Gas Marketing and Gas Utility segments, respectively, slightly offset by the lower contribution margin reported in Other. O&M expenses decreased $9.4 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, as discussed below. The decrease in O&M expenses was partially offset by $6.7 higher depreciation and amortization expense, driven principally by continued infrastructure investment at the Utilities in fiscal 2016.\nGas Utility\nOperating Revenues - Gas Utility Operating Revenues for fiscal 2016 decreased $436.4 compared to fiscal 2015, and was primarily attributable to the following factors:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower wholesale gas costs passed on to customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(262.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower system sales volumes\n</td> <td>(147.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri - Lower off-system sales and capacity release\n</td> <td>(25.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower gross receipts tax\n</td> <td>(21.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri - Higher ISRS charges\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Alabama - Lower RSE revenue adjustments\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New customer revenue from Spire EnergySouth acquisition\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Variation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(436.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContribution Margin - Gas Utility contribution margin was $844.4 for fiscal 2016, a $2.3 increase over the same period of fiscal 2015. The increase was attributable to the following factors:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower system sales volume\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri - Higher ISRS charges\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Alabama - Lower RSE revenue adjustments\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contribution margin from Spire EnergySouth acquisition\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Variation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase was primarily attributable to benefits of higher ISRS charges for Spire Missouri in 2016 of $13.8, lower RSE revenue adjustments, beneficial CCM and return on capital impacts totaling $4.5 for Spire Alabama, and $2.2 of contribution margin resulting from the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, which were mostly offset by the negative impact of lower sales volume. A $6.0 gain related to a legal settlement was recorded in other income, but contribution margin was reduced by a revenue adjustment corresponding to the $6.0 gain, resulting in no impact on net income. Temperatures in the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama service areas in fiscal 2016 were 19.7% and 30% warmer than in the same period in the prior year, respectively, significantly contributing to the $18.0 negative volume impact on contribution margin in fiscal 2016.\nOperating Expenses - Depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 increased $7.0 from the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, due principally to continued infrastructure capital spending in fiscal 2016. O&M expenses decreased $8.4 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of a $7.6 gain on the sale of property in 2015, O&M expenses were $16.0 below 2015 levels due primarily to lower bad debt expense (reflecting the impact of warmer weather experienced during the heating season) and employee-related costs.\nGas Marketing\nOperating Revenues - Gas Marketing operating revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $74.9 from the same prior year period. The decrease in revenues reflects the impact of higher total volumes being more than offset by lower commodity pricing levels, the effect of increased trading activities, and favorable mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives. Average pricing for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $2.286/MMBtu versus approximately $3.066/MMBtu for 2015, a $0.781 decline.\nContribution Margin - Gas Marketing contribution margin was $17.7 for fiscal 2016, a $5.0 increase compared to fiscal 2015. Favorable wholesale trading volumes and storage optimization resulted in an $11.7 increase more than offsetting $7.9 of negative pricing impacts. Fair value adjustments accounted for an additional $1.2 favorable impact in fiscal 2016.\nOther\nOperating Revenue and Operating Expenses - Other operating revenue increased $1.1 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in fiscal 2015, reflecting higher insurance revenues. Other O&M expenses were essentially flat with the prior year.\nInterest Charges\nInterest charges during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 increased $2.6 from fiscal 2015. Interest expense reductions from the refinancing of $115.0 in Spire Alabama long-term debt in September and December of 2015, along with lower average short-term borrowings, have been offset by higher rates on short-term borrowings, interest on debt issued to finance the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, interest on acquired debt, and charges related to a temporary bridge facility commitment obtained and terminated during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 related to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, average short-term borrowings were $273.9 and $300.6, respectively, and the average interest rates on those borrowings were 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nConsolidated income tax expense increased $7.3 in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a higher effective tax rate. The fiscal 2016 effective tax rate of 32.5% is approximately 1.3 percentage points higher than the rate for fiscal 2015. The higher fiscal 2016 rate includes tax expense associated with a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our financial statements:\nRegulatory Accounting - The Utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, Regulated Operations.\u201d The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). Management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of these regulatory accounting principles and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. For Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, management believes the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance:\nPGA Clause - Spire Missouri's PGA clauses allows the Missouri Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to a prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including the costs, cost reductions, and related carrying costs associated with the Missouri Utilities' use of natural gas derivative instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas. The difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period. The PGA clauses also permit the application of carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, and also provide for a portion of income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues to be flowed through to customers. Spire Missouri's PGA clauses also authorizes it to recover costs it incurs to finance its investment in gas supplies that are purchased during the storage injection season for sale during the heating season.\nGSA Rider - Spire Alabama's rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider, established in 1993, which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabama's tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA, that is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabama's earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. In prior years, Spire Alabama entered into cash flow derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on its gas supply. Spire Alabama recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Any realized gains or losses are passed through to customers using the mechanisms of the GSA rider in accordance with Spire Alabama's APSC approved tariff and are recognized as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. All derivative commodity instruments in a gain position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to each related counterparty. Derivative commodity instruments in a loss position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to Spire Alabama. Spire Alabama currently has no active gas supply derivative positions.\nGoodwill - Goodwill is measured as the excess of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred over the amount of acquisition-date identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities, and adjustments are recorded during the measurement period to finalize the allocation of purchase price. Spire Missouri has recorded goodwill related to the 2013 acquisition of Spire Missouri West, and Spire also has recorded goodwill related to the 2016 and 2014 acquisitions of Spire EnergySouth and Spire Alabama, respectively. Neither Spire EnergySouth nor Spire Alabama have goodwill on their balance sheets as push down accounting was not applied. Spire and Spire Missouri evaluate goodwill for impairment as of July 1 of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. At July 1, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Spire and Spire Missouri each applied a quantitative goodwill evaluation model to their reporting units and concluded goodwill was not impaired because the fair value exceeded the carrying amounts.\nEmployee Benefits and Postretirement Obligations - Pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions provided by management related to future events, such as discount rates, returns on plan assets, compensation increases, and mortality rates. For the Utilities, the amount of expense recognized and the amounts reflected in other comprehensive income are dependent upon the regulatory treatment provided for such costs, as discussed further below. Certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers' compensation claims, portions of which are self-insured and/or contain stop-loss\u201d coverage with third-party insurers to limit exposure, are established based on historical trends.\nThe amount of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs recognized in the financial statements related to the Utilities' qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based upon allowances, as approved by the MoPSC (for Spire Missouri) and as approved by the APSC (for Spire Alabama). The allowances have been established in the rate-making process for the recovery of these costs from customers. The differences between these amounts and actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs incurred for financial reporting purposes are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. GAAP also requires that changes that affect the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans, but that are not yet required to be recognized as components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs, be reflected in other comprehensive income. For the Utilities' qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, amounts that would otherwise be reflected in other comprehensive income are deferred with entries to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.\nThe tables below reflect the sensitivity of Spire's plans to potential changes in key assumptions:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension Plan Benefits:\nActuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/ (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Increase/ (Decrease) to Projected Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Increase/ (Decrease) to Annual Net Pension Cost*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected Return on Plan Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of Future Compensation Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postretirement Benefits:\nActuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/ (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Increase/ (Decrease) to Projected Postretirement Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Increase/ (Decrease) to Annual Net Postretirement Benefit Cost*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected Return on Plan Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual Medical Cost Trend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Excludes the impact of regulatory deferral mechanism.

On November 29, 2016, MoPSC staff recommended $4.5 and $3.4 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively, based on updated filings. On January 3, 2017, the MoPSC held a hearing to decide two issues raised by the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel (OPC) pertaining to the ISRS eligibility of hydrostatic testing done by Spire Missouri West and of the replacement of cast iron main interspersed with portions of plastic pipe. On January 18, 2017, the MoPSC found in favor of the Missouri Utilities on the interspersed plastics issue, but against Spire Missouri West on hydrostatic testing, and issued an order setting the ISRS increases at $4.5 and $3.2 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively, bringing total annualized ISRS revenue to $29.5 and $13.4, respectively. Rates were effective January 28, 2017. On March 3, 2017, the OPC filed an appeal to Missouri's Western District Court of Appeals of the MoPSC's decision permitting Spire Missouri to include in the ISRS the replacement of cast iron main interspersed with plastic pipe. The appeal will be heard in November 2017.\nOn February 3, 2017, Spire Missouri filed to increase its ISRS revenues, by $3.3 for Spire Missouri East and $2.9 for Spire Missouri West, related to ISRS investments from November 2016 through February 2017. Following the submission of updated information, on April 4, 2017, MoPSC staff submitted its recommendation for an increase in rates of approximately $3.0 each, for a cumulative total of $32.6 and $16.4 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively. On that same date, the OPC again raised an objection to the ISRS eligibility of replacing cast iron main interspersed with portions of plastic. On April 18, 2017, the parties filed with the MoPSC a unanimous stipulation and agreement proposing to apply the judicial outcome of the OPC's March 3, 2017 appeal on the plastics issue to both the ISRS cases on appeal and the current ISRS cases. The agreement was approved by the MoPSC on April 26, 2017. ISRS rates for each of the two service territories were increased by the MoPSC staff-recommended amounts, effective June 1, 2017.\nOn April 15, 2015, Spire Missouri applied to the MoPSC for a new authorization of long-term financing in the amount of $550.0. On February 10, 2016, the MoPSC issued an order, by a 3-2 vote, authorizing Spire Missouri financing authority of $300.0 for long-term financings placed any time before September 30, 2018. Spire Missouri filed an application for rehearing, which was denied on March 9, 2016. On March 31, 2016, Spire Missouri filed an appeal with Missouri's Western District Court of Appeals concerning this matter. The parties filed briefs and oral arguments were heard on November 17, 2016. On May 30, 2017, Missouri's Western District Court of Appeals issued a decision upholding the MoPSC's February 10, 2016 Order granting Spire Missouri $300.0 in long-term financing authority. On July 5, 2017, the Court denied Spire Missouri's request to transfer the case to the Missouri Supreme Court, and on October 5, 2017, the Missouri Supreme Court declined to hear Spire Missouri's direct appeal. On March 20, 2017, Spire Missouri entered into a bond purchase agreement for $170.0 that was funded on September 15, 2017, and applied against the $300.0 authorization.\nOn April 11, 2017, both Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West filed for a general rate case, and did so concurrently as agreed to in GM-2013-0254, as part of the acquisition of Spire Missouri West by Spire Missouri in fiscal 2013. The request for Spire Missouri East represents a net rate increase of $25.5. With the $32.6 already being billed in ISRS, the total base rate increase request was $58.1. Spire Missouri West's request represents a net rate increase of $34.0. With the $16.4 already being billed in ISRS, the total base rate increase request was $50.4. The rates were premised upon a 10.35% return on equity and the details of the filing can be found in GR-2017-0215 and GR-2017-0216 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively. An evidentiary hearing has been set for December 4 through 15, 2017, with a MoPSC decision expected by February 2018. Missouri statutes require new rates to be effective within 11 months of the filing, or by March 8, 2018.\nSpire Alabama\nSpire Alabama is subject to regulation by the APSC which established the RSE rate-setting process in 1983. Spire Alabama's current RSE order has a term extending beyond September 30, 2018, unless the APSC enters an order to the contrary in a manner consistent with law. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, whether physical or economic, of the nature of force majeure and including a change in control, the APSC and Spire Alabama will consult in good faith with respect to modifications, if any. Effective January 1, 2014, Spire Alabama's allowed range of return on average common equity is 10.5% to 10.95% with an adjusting point of 10.8%. Spire Alabama is eligible to receive a performance-based adjustment of 5 basis points to the return on equity adjusting point, based on meeting certain customer satisfaction criteria. Under RSE, the APSC conducts quarterly reviews to determine whether Spire Alabama's return on average common equity at the end of the rate year will be within the allowed range of return. Reductions in rates can be made quarterly to bring the projected return within the allowed range;\nincreases, however, are allowed only once each rate year, effective December 1, and cannot exceed 4% of prior-year revenues. The RSE reduction for the July 31, 2016 quarterly point of test was $4.8 and went into effect October 1, 2016, and for the quarterly point of test at September 30, 2016, Spire Alabama recorded a $2.7 RSE reduction effective December 1, 2016. As part of the annual update for RSE, on November 30, 2016, Spire Alabama filed a reduction for rate year 2017 of $2.5 that also became effective December 1, 2016. There was no RSE reduction for the January 31, 2017, April 30, 2017 and July 31, 2017 points of test. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Alabama recorded a $2.7 RSE reduction to operating revenues to bring the expected rate of return on average common equity at the end of the year to within the allowed range of return.\nThe inflation-based CCM, established by the APSC, allows for annual increases to O&M expense. The CCM range is Spire Alabama's 2007 actual rate year O&M expense inflation-adjusted using the June Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) each rate year plus or minus 1.75% (Index Range). If rate year O&M expense falls within the Index Range, no adjustment is required. If rate year O&M expense exceeds the Index Range, three-quarters of the difference is returned to customers through future rate adjustments. To the extent rate year O&M is less than the Index Range, Spire Alabama benefits by one-half of the difference through future rate adjustments. Certain items that fluctuate based on situations demonstrated to be beyond Spire Alabama's control may be excluded from the CCM calculation. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Alabama recorded a CCM benefit of $10.7 for rate year 2017, which will be reflected in rates effective December 1, 2017. The CCM benefit was $7.8 for rate year 2016 and $4.7 for rate year 2015.\nOn June 28, 2010, the APSC approved a reduction in depreciation rates, effective June 1, 2010, and a regulatory liability recorded for Spire Alabama. Refunds from such negative salvage liability will be passed back to eligible customers on a declining basis through lower tariff rates through rate year 2019 pursuant to the terms of the Negative Salvage Rebalancing (NSR) rider. The total amount refundable to customers is subject to adjustments over the remaining period for charges made to the Enhanced Stability Reserve (ESR) and other APSC-approved charges. The refunds are due to a re-estimation of future removal costs provided for through the prior depreciation rates. For fiscal 2017, approximately $6.3 of the customer refund was returned to customers. As of September 30, 2017, $12.3 is remaining to be refunded to customers. The NSR pass back for fiscal 2018 is $8.2 and will be reflected in rates effective December 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018.\nThe APSC approved an ESR in 1998, which was subsequently modified and expanded in 2010. As currently approved, the ESR provides deferred treatment and recovery for the following: (1) extraordinary O&M expenses related to environmental response costs; (2) extraordinary O&M expenses related to self-insurance costs that exceed $1.0 per occurrence; (3) extraordinary O&M expenses, other than environmental response costs and self-insurance costs, resulting from a single force majeure event or multiple force majeure events greater than $0.3 and $0.4, respectively, during a rate year; and (4) negative individual large commercial and industrial customer budget revenue variances that exceed $0.4 during a rate year. Charges to the ESR are subject to certain limitations which may disallow deferred treatment and which prescribe the timing of recovery. Funding to the ESR is provided as a reduction to the refundable negative salvage balance over its nine-year term beginning December 1, 2010. Subsequent to the nine-year period and subject to APSC authorization, Spire Alabama expects to be able to recover underfunded ESR balances over a five-year amortization period with an annual limitation of $0.7. Amounts in excess of this limitation are deferred for recovery in future years.\nSpire Alabama has APSC approval for an intercompany revolving credit agreement allowing Spire Alabama to borrow from Spire in a principal amount not to exceed $200.0 at any time outstanding in combination with its bank line of credit, and to loan to Spire in a principal amount not to exceed $25.0 at any time outstanding. Borrowings may be used for the following purposes: (a) meeting increased working capital requirements; (b) financing construction requirements related to additions, extensions, and replacements of the distribution systems; and (c) financing other expenditures that may arise from time to time in the normal course of business.\nOn September 18, 2017, Spire Alabama filed an application with the APSC for authorization to issue and sell $75.0 principal amount of debt and to purchase interest rate derivative instruments for the purpose of locking in favorable interest rates and to include the associated interest charges, issuance costs, fees and any gain or loss resulting from the settlement of such interest rate derivative instruments through rates. The application was approved by the APSC October 3, 2017.\nSpire\nIn addition to the matters described above, the following regulatory matters affect Spire.\nSpire Gulf has similar rate regulation to Spire Alabama. The RSE allowed range of return on average common equity is 10.45% to 10.95% with an adjusting point of 10.7%. The CCM has the same return and similar recovery provisions when expenses exceed or are under a band of +/- 1.50% around the CPI-U inflated O&M per customer expense level from September 30, 2017, excluding expenses for pensions and gas bad debt. Additionally, it has a Cast Iron Main Replacement (CIMR) factor that provides an enhanced return on the pro-rata costs associated with cast iron main replacement for miles over 10 miles per year based on a 75% weighting for the equity content. Spire Gulf also has an ESR for negative revenue variances over $o.1 or a force majeure event expense of $0.1 (or two events that exceed $0.15), a Self Insurance Reserve (SIR) for general liability coverage, and an Environmental Cost Recovery Factor (ECRF) as part of its PGA that recovers 90% of prudently incurred costs for compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations. It also has an APSC-approved intercompany revolving credit agreement with Spire to borrow in a principal amount not to exceed $50.0, and to loan up to $25.0.\nOn September 21, 2017, Spire Gulf filed an application to defer certain pension and post-retirement health plan costs. The application was approved by the APSC October 3, 2017.\nSpire Mississippi utilizes a formula rate-making process under the Rate Stabilization Adjustment (RSA) Rider. It is based on a formulaically derived return on equity, and is updated on an annual basis if the equity return on an end of period rate base is beyond the allowed return on equity by 1.0%, with 75% of any shortfall back to the midpoint being put into a rate increase and 50% of any excess back to the midpoint resulting in a rate decrease. Updates are made based on known and measurable adjustments to historic costs from 12-months ended June 30, submitted September 15 for an effective date of November 1, unless disputed by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff, with any disputes to be resolved by the MSPSC by January 15 of the following year. Spire Mississippi had approved December 3, 2015 a Supplemental Growth Rider (SGR) for a 3-year period to provide enhanced returns of a 12.0% return on equity for a period of 10 years on certain system expansion projects.\nIn July 2016, the proposed project of Spire STL Pipeline LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire, was accepted into the pre-filing process at the FERC. The proposal outlined the plan to build, own, operate, and maintain a pipeline interconnecting with the Rockies Express pipeline to deliver natural gas to the St. Louis, Missouri area. As an interstate project, the Spire STL Pipeline is being reviewed for siting and permitting by the FERC, which is the lead agency for other federal, state, and local permitting authorities. In January 2017, Spire submitted an application with the FERC requesting issuance of a certificate of convenience and necessity authorizing it to construct, own, and operate an interstate pipeline. Several parties have filed interventions and comments regarding the Spire STL Pipeline project. The company is monitoring these closely and has responded where appropriate. In April 2017, Spire STL Pipeline filed an amended certificate application to adjust the preferred route to include a new six-mile segment rather than an existing line, offering a number of benefits including eliminating potential supply disruption risk for Spire Missouri during construction, eliminating uncertainty regarding upgrade costs, and reducing long-term integrity management costs. In its Environmental Assessment issued on September 29, 2017, the FERC concluded that approval of the Spire STL Pipeline, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Spire anticipates the FERC will deliver a Final Order by the end of calendar year 2017.\nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThe Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have evaluated or are in the process of evaluating the impact that recently issued accounting standards will have on their financial position or results of operations upon adoption. For disclosures related to the adoption of new accounting standards, see the New Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nINFLATION\nThe accompanying financial statements reflect the historical costs of events and transactions, regardless of the purchasing power of the dollar at the time. Due to the capital-intensive nature of the businesses of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, the most significant impact of inflation is on the depreciation of utility plant. Rate regulation, to which the Utilities are subject, allows recovery through its rates of only the historical cost of utility plant as depreciation. The Utilities expect to incur significant capital expenditures in future years, primarily related to the planned increased replacements of distribution plant. The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama believe that any higher costs experienced upon replacement of existing facilities will be recovered through the normal regulatory process.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nCASH FLOWS\nThe Company's short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when the Utilities borrow money to cover the lag between when they purchase natural gas and when their customers pay for that gas. Changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas (including cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri's use of natural gas derivative instruments), variations in the timing of collections of gas cost under the Utilities' PGA clauses and GSA riders, the seasonality of accounts receivable balances, and the utilization of storage gas inventories cause short-term cash requirements to vary during the year and from year to year, and may cause significant variations in the Company's cash provided by or used in operating activities.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flow Summary\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(433.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(612.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(298.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>147.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $39.9 from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The change is primarily due to fluctuations in working capital, as mentioned above, largely driven by the relative weather conditions and gas prices during the periods. Cash was provided by increases in accounts payable, net income, depreciation, and deferred income taxes. These benefits were more than offset by a net decrease in advance customer billings and net increases in accounts receivable and natural gas inventory values.\nThe Company used $179.2 less cash in investing activities in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016 but $134.8 more than in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 included $317.7 net cash used for the acquisition of Spire EnergySouth, while fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2015 included only smaller acquisition settlements. Capital expenditures increased $144.8 from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the higher level of infrastructure upgrades across both Missouri and Alabama, as well as $16.0 from the addition of EnergySouth and $25.5 for the Spire STL Pipeline project. Spire estimates its capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 will be approximately $485.0, including approximately $415.0 for the Utilities. The increase in investment reflects the continued commitment to infrastructure upgrades at the Utilities and the beginning of the construction phase of the Spire STL Pipeline.\nCash provided by financing activities was $128.5 lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016. This change primarily reflects the effect of a $26.2 net issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017 compared with a $165.0 net issuance the previous year, while short-term borrowings continued to increase, reflecting the Company's growing operations. Stock issuances in fiscal 2017, which included the conversion of equity units issued in 2014, provided $9.7 more cash than last year, which included the offering to help fund the Spire EnergySouth acquisition. These net cash inflows were partially offset by continued increases in dividend payments and other financing activities this year. In fiscal 2015, the net issuances of long-term debt and common stock were not significant. In the first half of fiscal 2018, Spire Alabama plans to issue long-term notes totaling $75.0. Spire Missouri expects to refinance $100.0 of bonds due in August 2018.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nBank deposits were used to support working capital needs of the business. Spire had no temporary cash investments as of September 30, 2017 or 2016. Due to lower yields available to Spire on short-term investments, the Company elected to provide a portion of Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's short-term funding through intercompany lending during the past fiscal year.\nShort-term Debt\nThe Utilities' short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during the colder months, while the Company's needs are less seasonal. These short-term cash requirements can be met through the sale of commercial paper or through the use of a revolving credit facility.\nOn December 14, 2016, Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama entered into a new syndicated revolving credit facility pursuant to a loan agreement with 11 banks, expiring December 14, 2021. The largest portion provided by a single bank under the line is 12.3%. The loan agreement replaced Spire's and Spire Missouri's existing loan agreements dated as of September 3, 2013 and amended September 3, 2014, which were set to expire on September 3, 2019, and Spire Alabama's existing loan agreement dated September 2, 2014, which was set to expire September 2, 2019. All three previous agreements were terminated on December 14, 2016.\nThe loan agreement has an aggregate credit commitment of $975.0, including sublimits of $300.0 for Spire, $475.0 for Spire Missouri, and $200.0 for Spire Alabama. These sublimits may be reallocated from time to time among the three borrowers within the $975.0 aggregate commitment. Spire may use its line to provide for the funding needs of various subsidiaries. Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama expect to use the loan agreement for general corporate purposes, including short-term borrowings and letters of credit. The agreement also contains financial covenants limiting each borrower's consolidated total debt, including short-term debt, to no more than 70% of its total capitalization. As defined in the line of credit, on September 30, 2017, total debt was 56% of total capitalization for the consolidated Company, 50% for Spire Missouri, and 33% for Spire Alabama. There were no borrowings against this credit facility as of September 30, 2017.\nOn December 21, 2016, Spire established a commercial paper program (Program) pursuant to which Spire may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (Notes). Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $975.0. The Notes may have maturities of up to 365 days from date of issue. The net proceeds of the issuances of the Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including to provide working capital for both utility and non-utility subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2017, Notes outstanding under the Program totaled $477.3.\nInformation about Spire's consolidated short-term borrowings is presented in the following table. Based on average short-term borrowings for the year ended September 30, 2017, an increase in the average interest rate of 100 basis points would decrease Spire's pre-tax earnings and cash flows by approximately $4.9 on an annual basis, portions of which may be offset through the application of PGA or GSA carrying costs.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Spire\nShort-term Borrowings1\n</td> <td>Spire Missouri\nCommercial Paper Borrowings2\n</td> <td>Spire Alabama\nBank Line Borrowings\n</td> <td>Total\nShort-term Borrowings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$369.0\n</td> <td>$88.5\n</td> <td>$28.3\n</td> <td>$485.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>1.3%\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> <td>1.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Range of borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$73.0 - $675.6\n</td> <td>$0.0 - $329.7\n</td> <td>$0.0 - $102.5\n</td> <td>$395.5 - $675.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$477.3\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>$477.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$42.7\n</td> <td>$201.0\n</td> <td>$30.2\n</td> <td>$273.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> <td>0.7%\n</td> <td>1.4%\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Range of borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$0.0 - $82.0\n</td> <td>$43.0 - $307.2\n</td> <td>$0.0 - $82.0\n</td> <td>$73.1 - $427.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$73.0\n</td> <td>$243.7\n</td> <td>$82.0\n</td> <td>$398.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>1.8%\n</td> <td>0.8%\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> <td>1.1%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Spire Short-term Borrowings includes bank line borrowings of Spire Inc.

All long-term debt bears fixed rates and is subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases and decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities' regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemption of long-term debt typically would be deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities and amortized over a future period.\nOf the Company's $2,112.0 long-term debt (including the current portion), $25.0 has no call options, $1,037.0 has make-whole call options, $5.0 is callable currently, and $1,045.0 is callable at par one to six months prior to maturity.\nMaturities of long-term debt for Spire on a consolidated basis, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama for the five fiscal years subsequent to September 30, 2017 are as follows:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Spire\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Spire Missouri\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Spire Alabama\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>180.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>40.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>55.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSpire's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's short-term credit facilities and long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants and default provisions. As of September 30, 2017, there were no events of default under these covenants.\nThe Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs, may depend on the credit rating of the entity that is accessing the capital markets. The credit ratings of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama remain at investment grade, but are subject to review and change by the rating agencies.\nIt is management's view that the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have adequate access to capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources, both internal and external, to meet anticipated capital requirements, which primarily include capital expenditures, interest payments on long-term debt, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, short-term seasonal needs, and dividends.\nOn March 10, 2017, Spire redeemed in full at par its $250.0 floating rate notes due August 15, 2017, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn March 15, 2017, Spire completed the issuance and sale of $100.0 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2027. The notes bear interest at the rate of 3.93% per annum, payable semi-annually. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the notes for the repayment of other debt.\nIn 2014, Spire issued 2.875 million equity units as a portion of the Spire Alabama acquisition financing. The equity units were originally issued at $50 per unit pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (Purchase Contract) dated as of June 11, 2014 between Spire and U.S. Bank National Association, as purchase contract agent, collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary. These units consisted of $143.8 aggregate principal amount of 2014 Series A 2.00% remarketable junior subordinated notes due 2022 (the Junior Notes) and the Purchase Contract obligating the holder to purchase common shares at a future settlement date (anticipated to be three years in the future and prior to the Junior Notes maturity).\nThe equity unit investments were effectively replaced as planned in a series of transactions outlined below:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On February 22, 2017, the selling securityholders (as defined below) agreed to purchase the Junior Notes in connection with the remarketing of the junior subordinated notes that comprised a component of the equity units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On the same day, Spire entered two related agreements: (1) a Securities Purchase and Registration Rights Agreement (the SPRRA), among Spire and the several purchasers named therein (the selling securityholders), obligating the selling securityholders to sell the Junior Notes to Spire in exchange for $143.8 aggregate principal amount of Spire's 3.543% Senior Notes due 2024 (the Senior Notes) and a cash payment, and (2) an underwriting agreement with the selling securityholders and the several underwriters named therein in connection with the public offering of $150.0 aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes consisting of $6.2 principal amount of the Senior Notes issued and sold by Spire and $143.8 principal amount of the Senior Notes sold by the selling securityholders.

Under the contract term, the equity units were converted to common stock at the rate of 0.8712, with a corresponding adjustment to purchase price. Spire received net cash proceeds of approximately $142.0, which it used to repay short-term debt incurred the previous month to redeem the floating rate notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> On September 15, 2017, Spire Missouri issued and sold in a private placement $50.0 in aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due September 15, 2032, $70.0 in aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due September 15, 2047 and $50.0 in aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due September 15, 2057. Spire Missouri used the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. The 2032 bonds, 2047 bonds and 2057 bonds bear interest at a rate per annum of 3.68%, 4.23% and 4.38%, respectively, payable semi-annually on the 15th day of March and September of each year.\nSpire Missouri has authority from the MoPSC to issue debt securities and preferred stock, including on a private placement basis, as well as to issue common stock, receive paid-in-capital, and enter into capital lease agreements, all for a total of up to $300.0 for financings placed any time before September 30, 2018. During the year ended September 30, 2017, Spire Missouri issued $170.0 in securities under this authorization, so as of that date, $130.0 remains available to be issued.\nSpire has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the issuance and sale of up to 250,000 shares of common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan. There were 244,130 and 239,945 at September 30, 2017 and November 10, 2017, respectively, remaining available for issuance under this Form S-3. Spire also has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of equity and debt securities. Spire Missouri has a shelf registration on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for issuance of first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt, and preferred stock, which expires on September 22, 2019.\nIncluding the current portion of long-term debt, the Company's capitalization at September 30, 2017 consisted of 48.7% of common stock equity and 51.3% long-term debt, compared to 46.1% of common stock equity and 53.9% of long-term debt at September 30, 2016.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAs of September 30, 2017, Spire had contractual obligations with payments due as summarized below:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal Payments on Long-term Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,112.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,687.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Payments on Long-term Debt (a)\n</td> <td>1,242.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases (b)\n</td> <td>83.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations - Natural Gas (c)\n</td> <td>1,281.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>703.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>373.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations - Other (d)\n</td> <td>74.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Retirement Obligations\n</td> <td>296.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (e)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,091.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>972.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>803.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,967.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt.

Each of the Utilities generally recovers costs related to its purchases, transportation, and storage of natural gas through the operation of its PGA clause or GSA rider, subject to prudence review by the appropriate regional public service commission. Variations in the timing of collections of gas costs from customers may affect short-term cash requirements.

The PGA clauses and GSA rider allows the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC and APSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies, as well as gas inventory carrying costs. Spire Missouri is allowed the flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months. Spire Missouri is able to mitigate, to some extent, changes in commodity prices through the use of physical storage supplies and regional supply diversity. The Utilities also have risk management policies that allow for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing its price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. These policies prohibit speculation. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Missouri had active natural gas derivative positions, but Spire Alabama did not. Costs and cost reduction, including carrying costs, associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to customers through the operation of the PGA clauses or GSA rider. Accordingly, the Utilities do not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments. However, the timing of recovery for cash payments related to margin requirements may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. For more information about the Utilities' natural gas derivative instruments, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nGas Marketing\nIn the course of its business, Spire's non-regulated gas marketing subsidiary, Spire Marketing, enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and natural gas index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments. In accordance with the risk management policy, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed price commitments. This risk is currently managed either by closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed-prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to lock in margins. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, Spire Marketing's unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spire's financial position or results of operations.\nAs mentioned above, Spire Marketing uses natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the NYMEX and ICE to manage the commodity price risk associated with its fixed-price natural gas purchase and sale commitments. These derivative instruments may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases or sales. Such accounting treatment, if elected, generally permits a substantial portion of the gain or loss to be deferred from recognition in earnings until the period that the associated forecasted purchase or sale is recognized in earnings. To the extent a hedge is effective, gains or losses on the derivatives will be offset by changes in the value of the hedged forecasted transactions. Information about the fair values of Spire Marketing's exchange-traded/cleared natural gas derivative instruments is presented below:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Derivative\nFair\nValues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash\nMargin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Derivatives\nand Cash\nMargin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net balance of derivative assets at September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Settlements/purchases - net\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in cash margin\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net balance of derivative assets at September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of September 30, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity by Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair values of exchange-traded/cleared natural gas derivatives - net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair values of basis swaps - net\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Position volumes:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MMBtu - net (short) long futures/swap/option positions\n</td> <td>(16.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MMBtu - net (short) long basis swap positions\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain of Spire Marketing's physical natural gas derivative contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales, as permitted by GAAP. This election permits the Company to account for the contract in the period the natural gas is delivered. Contracts not designated as normal purchases or normal sales, including those designated as trading activities, are accounted for as derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the periods prior to settlement.\nBelow is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for physical natural gas contracts accounted for as derivatives, none of which will settle beyond fiscal 2020:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net balance of derivative assets at September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Settlements\n</td> <td>(7.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net balance of derivative liabilities at September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor further details related to Spire Marketing's derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nSpire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with energy producers, utility companies, and pipelines. These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. To the extent possible, Spire Marketing enters into netting arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate exposure to credit risk. It is also exposed to credit risk associated with its derivative contracts designated as normal purchases and normal sales. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations. For more information on these concentrations of credit risk, including how Spire Marketing manages these risks, see Note 11, Concentrations of Credit Risk, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk associated with its long-term and short-term debt issuances. Based on average short-term borrowings during fiscal 2017, an increase of 100 basis points in the underlying average interest rate for short-term debt would have caused an increase in interest expense of approximately $4.9 on an annual basis. Portions of such increases may be offset through the application of PGA carrying costs. At September 30, 2017, Spire had no variable rate long-term debt outstanding but had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling $2,112.0, which includes $67.0 of fixed-rate long-term debt assumed through the acquisition of Spire EnergySouth. Spire Missouri had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling $980.0 and Spire Alabama had fixed rate long-term debt of $250.0, both included in Spire's total long-term debt. While these long-term debt issues are fixed-rate, they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities' regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemptions of long-term debt would typically be deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and amortized over a future period.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2016, Spire entered into five-year interest rate swap transactions with a fixed interest rate of 1.776% and a notional amount of $105.0 to protect itself against adverse movement in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company entered into seven-year swap transactions with an average fixed interest rate of 1.501% and a notional amount of $120.0 to hedge additional debt expected to be issued in fiscal 2017. All of these hedge positions were settled during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, resulting in a gain of $14.1 which will be amortized over the hedged periods. Also during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Spire entered into a ten-year interest rate swap with a fixed interest rate of 2.658% and a notional amount of $60.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future interest rate payments. The Company recorded a $0.9 mark-to-market loss on this swap for the year ended September 30, 2017. Refer to Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional details on these interest rate swap transactions.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nThe Utilities own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Company's, Spire Missouri's, or Spire Alabama's financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations, and their interpretations change, however, the Utilities may be required to incur additional costs. For information relative to environmental matters, see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAt September 30, 2017, the Company had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements, other than operating leases and letters of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not expect to engage in any significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Dollars in millions, except per share and per unit amounts)\nINTRODUCTION\nThis section analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of Spire Inc. (Spire or the Company), Spire Missouri Inc. (Spire Missouri or the Missouri Utilities), and Spire Alabama Inc. (Spire Alabama). Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama, and Spire EnergySouth Inc. (Spire EnergySouth) are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. Spire Missouri changed its name from Laclede Gas Company on August 30, 2017, and Spire Alabama changed its name from Alabama Gas Corporation on September 1, 2017. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth Inc. (formerly known as EnergySouth, Inc.) are collectively referred to as the Utilities. The subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth are Spire Gulf Inc. (Spire Gulf, formerly known as Mobile Gas Service Corporation) and Spire Mississippi Inc. (Spire Mississippi, formerly known as Willmut Gas & Oil Company). This section includes management's view of factors that affect the respective businesses of the Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama, explanations of financial results including changes in earnings and costs from the prior periods, and the effects of such factors on the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's overall financial condition and liquidity.\nReference is made to Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe Company has two key business segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. Spire's earnings are primarily derived from its Gas Utility segment, which reflects the regulated activities of the Utilities. Due to the seasonal nature of the Utilities' business, earnings of Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are typically concentrated during the heating season of November through April each fiscal year.\nGas Utility - Spire Missouri\nSpire Missouri is Missouri's largest natural gas distribution utility and is regulated by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC). Spire Missouri serves St. Louis and eastern Missouri through Spire Missouri East (formerly Laclede Gas Company) and serves Kansas City and western Missouri through Spire Missouri West (formerly Missouri Gas Energy, or MGE). Spire Missouri delivers natural gas to retail customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the MoPSC. The earnings of Spire Missouri are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. The rate design for each service territory serves to lessen the impact of weather volatility on its customers during cold winters and stabilize Spire Missouri's earnings.\nGas Utility - Spire Alabama\nSpire Alabama is the largest natural gas distribution utility in the state of Alabama. Spire Alabama's service territory is located in central and northern Alabama. Among the cities served by Spire Alabama are Birmingham, the center of the largest metropolitan area in the state, and Montgomery, the state capital. Spire Alabama is regulated by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC). Spire Alabama purchases natural gas through interstate and intrastate suppliers and distributes the purchased gas through its distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and other end-users of natural gas. Spire Alabama also provides transportation services to large industrial and commercial customers located on its distribution system. These transportation customers, using Spire Alabama as their agent or acting on their own, purchase gas directly from marketers or suppliers and arrange for delivery of the gas into the Spire Alabama distribution system. Spire Alabama charges a fee to transport such customer-owned gas through its distribution system to the customers' facilities.\nGas Marketing\nSpire Marketing Inc. (Spire Marketing) is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related activities on a non-regulated basis and is reported in the Gas Marketing segment. Spire Marketing markets natural gas across the country with the core of its footprint located in and around the central United States (US). It holds firm transportation and storage contracts in order to effectively manage its customer base, which consists of producers, pipelines, power generators, storage operators, municipalities, utility companies, and large commercial and industrial customers.\nBusiness Evaluation Factors\nBased on the nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as current economic conditions, management focuses on the following key variables in evaluating the financial condition and results of operations and managing the business.\nGas Utility segment:\n \u2022 the Utilities' ability to recover the costs of purchasing and distributing natural gas from their customers; \n \u2022 the impact of weather and other factors, such as customer conservation, on revenues and expenses; \n \u2022 changes in the regulatory environment at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as decisions by regulators, that impact the Utilities' ability to earn its authorized rate of return in all service territories they serve; \n \u2022 the Utilities' ability to access credit markets and maintain working capital sufficient to meet operating requirements; \n \u2022 the effect of natural gas price volatility on the business; and \n \u2022 the ability to integrate the operations of all acquisitions.  Gas Marketing segment:\n \u2022 the risks of competition; \n \u2022 fluctuations in natural gas prices; \n \u2022 new national infrastructure projects; \n \u2022 the ability to procure firm transportation and storage services at reasonable rates; \n \u2022 credit and/or capital market access; \n \u2022 counterparty risks; and \n \u2022 the effect of natural gas price volatility on the business.  Further information regarding how management seeks to manage these key variables is discussed below.\nGas Utility\nThe Utilities seek to provide reliable natural gas services at a reasonable cost, while maintaining and building secure and dependable infrastructures. The Utilities' strategies focus on improving both performance and the ability to recover their authorized distribution costs and rates of return. The Utilities' distribution costs are the essential, primarily fixed, expenditures it must incur to operate and maintain more than 58,000 miles of mains and services comprising the natural gas distribution systems and related storage facilities for Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth.\nThe Utilities' distribution costs include wages and employee benefit costs, depreciation and maintenance expenses, and other regulated utility operating expenses, excluding natural and propane gas expense. Distribution costs are considered in the rate-making process, and recovery of these types of costs is included in revenues generated through the Utilities' tariff rates. Spire Missouri's tariff rates are approved by the MoPSC, whereas Spire Alabama's tariff rates are approved by the APSC. The subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi, have tariff rates that are approved by the APSC and Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC), respectively. Spire Missouri also has an off-system sales and capacity release income stream that is regulated by tariff.\nSpire Missouri's income from off-system sales and capacity release remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. Spire Missouri is allowed to retain the following portions of annual income (shown by service territory):\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Customer Share\n</td> <td>Company Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First $2.0 of pre-tax income*\n</td> <td>85%\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Next $2.0 of pre-tax income\n</td> <td>80%\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Next $2.0 of pre-tax income\n</td> <td>75%\n</td> <td>25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts of pre-tax income exceeding $6.0\n</td> <td>70%\n</td> <td>30%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>* Customer share was set to 85% and company share set to 15% in fiscal 2017.

When Spire Missouri's service area experiences warmer-than-normal weather while other markets experience colder weather or supply constraints, some of Spire Missouri's natural gas supply is available for off-system sales.\nThe Utilities work actively to reduce the impact of wholesale natural gas price volatility on their costs by strategically structuring their natural gas supply portfolios to increase their gas supply availability and pricing alternatives. They may also use derivative instruments to hedge against significant changes in the commodity price of natural gas. Nevertheless, the overall cost of purchased gas remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. The Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf, and Spire Mississippi and Spire Alabama's Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider allow the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the public service commissions, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including costs, cost reductions, and related carrying costs associated with the use of derivative instruments to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas, as well as gas inventory carrying costs. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Missouri had active derivative positions, but Spire Alabama has had no gas supply derivative instrument activity since 2010. The Utilities believe they will continue to be able to obtain sufficient gas supply. The price of natural gas supplies and other economic conditions may affect sales volumes, due to the conservation efforts of customers, and cash flows associated with the timing of collection of gas costs and related accounts receivable from customers.\nThe Utilities rely on short-term credit and long-term capital markets, as well as cash flows from operations, to satisfy their seasonal cash requirements and fund their capital expenditures. The Utilities' ability to issue commercial paper, access their lines of credit, issue long-term bonds, or obtain new lines of credit is dependent on current conditions in the credit and capital markets. Management focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and believes it currently has adequate access to credit and capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources to meet their foreseeable obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information.\nGas Marketing\nSpire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and providing energy services to both on-system utility transportation customers and customers outside of the Utilities' traditional service areas. Spire Marketing utilizes its natural gas supply agreements, transportation agreements, park and loan agreements, storage agreements, and other executory contracts to support a variety of services to its customers at competitive prices. It closely monitors and manages the natural gas commodity price and volatility risks associated with providing such services to its customers through the use of a variety of risk management activities, including the use of exchange-traded/cleared derivative instruments and other contractual arrangements. Spire Marketing is committed to managing commodity price risk while it seeks to expand the services that it now provides. Nevertheless, income from the Gas Marketing operations is subject to more fluctuations in market conditions than the Utilities' operations.\nThe Gas Marketing business is directly impacted by the effects of competition in the marketplace, the impacts of new infrastructure, surplus natural gas supplies, and the addition of new demand from exports, power generation and industrial load. Spire Marketing's management expects a growing need for marketing services across the country as customers manage seasonal variability and marketplace volatility.\nIn addition to its operating cash flows, Spire Marketing relies on Spire's parental guarantees to secure its purchase and sales obligations of natural gas, and it also has access to Spire's liquidity resources. A large portion of Spire Marketing's receivables are from customers in the energy industry. It also enters into netting arrangements with many of its energy counterparties to reduce overall credit and collateral exposure. Although Spire Marketing's uncollectible amounts are closely monitored and have not been significant, increases in uncollectible amounts from customers are possible and could adversely affect Gas Marketing's liquidity and results of operations.\nSpire Marketing carefully monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its transactions. It performs in-house credit reviews of potential customers and may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit, or parental guarantees when appropriate. Credit limits for customers are established and monitored.\nAs a result of infrastructure optimization activities and an abundance of natural gas supply, Spire Marketing cannot be certain that all of its wholesale purchase and sale transactions will settle physically. As such, certain transactions are designated as trading activities for financial reporting purposes, due to their settlement characteristics. Results of operations from trading activities are reported on a net basis in Gas Marketing operating revenues (or expenses, if negative), which may cause volatility in the Company's operating revenues, but have no effect on operating income or net income.\nIn the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. In accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), some of its purchase and sale transactions are not recognized in earnings until the natural gas is physically delivered, while other energy-related transactions, including those designated as trading activities, are required to be accounted for as derivatives, with the changes in their fair value (representing unrealized gains or losses) recorded in earnings in periods prior to settlement. Because related transactions of a purchase and sale strategy may be accounted for differently, there may be timing differences in the recognition of earnings under GAAP and economic earnings realized upon settlement. The Company reports both GAAP and net economic earnings (non-GAAP), as discussed below.\nOther\nIn addition to the Gas Utility and Gas Marketing segments, other non-utility activities of the Company include:\n \u2022 unallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs; \n \u2022 Spire STL Pipeline, a subsidiary of Spire planning construction and operation of a proposed 65-mile Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulated pipeline to deliver natural gas into eastern Missouri; and \n \u2022 Spire's subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline, compression of natural gas and risk management, among other activities. \nEARNINGS\nNet income reported by Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama is determined in accordance with GAAP. Management also uses the non-GAAP financial measures of net economic earnings, net economic earnings per share and contribution margin when internally evaluating and reporting results of operations. These non-GAAP operating metrics should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, GAAP measures such as net income, earnings per share and operating income. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Net Economic Earnings and Net Economic Earnings Per Share\nNet economic earnings and net economic earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude from net income the after-tax impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions as well as acquisition, divestiture, and restructuring activities. These fair value and timing adjustments are made in instances where the accounting treatment differs from what management considers the economic substance of the underlying transaction, including the following:\n \u2022 Net unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives that are required by GAAP fair value accounting associated with current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. These unrealized gains and losses result primarily from two sources: \n 1) changes in the fair values of physical and/or financial derivatives prior to the period of settlement; and, \n 2) ineffective portions of accounting hedges, required to be recorded in earnings prior to settlement, due to differences in commodity price changes between the locations of the forecasted physical purchase or sale transactions and the locations of the underlying hedge instruments; \n \u2022 Lower of cost or market adjustments to the carrying value of commodity inventories resulting when the market price of the commodity falls below its original cost, to the extent that those commodities are economically hedged; and \n \u2022 Realized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of economic hedges prior to the sale of the physical commodity.  These adjustments eliminate the impact of timing differences and the impact of current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in each period until being replaced with the actual gains or losses realized when the associated physical transactions occur. While management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate both the Utilities and non-utility businesses, the net effect of adjustments on the Utilities' earnings is minimal because gains or losses on their natural gas derivative instruments are deferred pursuant to state regulation.\nManagement believes that excluding the earnings volatility caused by recognizing changes in fair value prior to settlement and other timing differences associated with related purchase and sale transactions provides a useful representation of the economic effects of only the actual settled transactions and their effects on results of operations. In addition, management excludes the impact related to certain acquisition, divestiture, and restructuring activities when evaluating on-going performance, and therefore excludes these impacts from net economic earnings. Similarly, in fiscal years 2016, 2014 and 2013, net economic earnings per share excludes the impact of shares issued in those years to finance acquisitions that closed late in each fiscal year. Management believes that this presentation provides a useful representation of operating performance by facilitating comparisons of year-over-year results. The definition and measurement of net economic earnings provided above is consistent with that used by management and the Board of Directors in assessing the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's performance as well as determining performance under the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's incentive compensation plans. Further, the Company believes this better enables an investor to view the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's performance in that period on a basis that would be comparable to prior periods.\nReconciliations of net economic earnings and net economic earnings per share to the Company's most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages.\nNon-GAAP Measure - Contribution Margin\nIn addition to operating revenues and operating expenses, management also uses the non-GAAP measure of contribution margin when evaluating results of operations. The Utilities pass to their customers (subject to prudence review by, as applicable, the MoPSC, APSC, or MSPSC) increases and decreases in the wholesale cost of natural gas in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA rider. The volatility of the wholesale natural gas market results in fluctuations from period to period in the recorded levels of, among other items, revenues and natural gas cost expense. Nevertheless, increases and decreases in the cost of gas associated with system gas sales volumes and gross receipts tax expense (which are calculated as a percentage of revenues), with the same amount (excluding immaterial timing differences) included in revenues, has no direct effect on operating income. Contribution margin is defined as operating revenues less natural and propane gas costs and gross receipts tax expense. As these items are reflected in both operating revenue and operating expenses and management has little control over these amounts for the Utilities, management believes that contribution margin is a useful supplemental measure. In addition, it is management's belief that contribution margin and the remaining operating expenses that calculate operating income are useful in assessing the Company's and the Utilities' performance as management has more ability to influence control over these revenues and expenses.\nSpire\nOverview - Net Income (Loss)\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

May 2016 equity issuance to fund a portion of the acquisition of Spire EnergySouth. The weighted average diluted shares used in the net economic earnings per share calculation for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 43.5 compared to 44.3 in the GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculation. For fiscal years 2017 and 2015, net economic earnings per share is calculated by replacing consolidated net income with consolidated net economic earnings in the GAAP diluted EPS calculation. \n2017 vs. 2016\nConsolidated\nSpire's net income was $161.6 in fiscal 2017, compared with $144.2 in fiscal 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $3.44 and $3.43, respectively, for fiscal 2017 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $3.26 and $3.24, respectively, for fiscal 2016. Net economic earnings were $167.6 (or $3.56 per share) in fiscal 2017, compared with $149.1 (or $3.42 per share) in fiscal 2016, an increase of $18.5. Net income increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to $21.5 income growth in the Gas Utility segment, partly offset by a $3.7 income decline in the Gas Marketing segment and a $0.4 larger loss from other activities.\nGas Utility\nGas Utility net income and net economic earnings increased by $21.5 and $21.2, respectively, in fiscal 2017, compared to fiscal 2016. The increases to net income and net economic earnings were driven by the $9.6 income growth generated by the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, margin growth and combined lower O&M expenses at Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama. The margin growth was driven by higher Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS) charges at the Missouri Utilities and net favorable regulatory adjustments at Spire Alabama, partly offset by weather impacts resulting from warmer winter temperatures. These impacts were partly offset by increases in depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, interest expense was higher due to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition and higher interest charges experienced by Spire Missouri. Income taxes were also higher due to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition and higher pre-tax income for both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama. Further details are discussed in the Gas Utility, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama sections below.\nGas Marketing\nGas Marketing reported net income totaling $3.4, a decrease of $3.7 compared with the same period last year. Net economic earnings for fiscal 2017 increased $0.4 from fiscal 2016. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to unfavorable mark-to-market (MTM) activity in the current year. Net economic earnings benefited from increased value from spreads and asset optimization in the current year versus the prior year. Further details are discussed in the Gas Marketing section below.\nOther\nThe combined increase in net loss and net economic loss for the Company's other non-utility activities were $0.4 and $3.1, respectively, for fiscal 2017 compared to the same period last year. The increased loss was primarily the result of higher current year interest charges associated with the September 2016 acquisition of Spire EnergySouth.\nOperating Revenues and Operating Expenses\nReconciliations of contribution margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are shown below.

for $1,537.3 the same period last year. The increase was driven primarily by the Utilities, the result of the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, higher ISRS charges at Spire Missouri, favorable regulatory adjustments at Spire Alabama, and higher gas costs passed on to customers in both Missouri and Alabama. These positive drivers were partly offset by lower demand as a result of warmer weather. Spire's contribution margin increased $88.2 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher contribution margin of $94.6 for the Gas Utility segment, slightly offset by the lower contribution margin reported in Gas Marketing. Operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses increased $26.7 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the same period last year, as discussed below. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $16.6, driven principally by the Spire EnergySouth acquisition and continued infrastructure investment at Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama in fiscal 2017.\nGas Utility\nOperating Revenues - Gas Utility operating revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $208.5 compared to fiscal 2016, and was attributable to the following factors:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New customer revenue from Spire EnergySouth acquisition\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher wholesale gas costs passed on to customers\n</td> <td>87.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Alabama - Lower Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE) revenue reduction and higher Cost Control Measure (CCM) benefit\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri - Higher off-system sales and capacity release\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri - Higher ISRS charges\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher gross receipts tax\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weather / temperature adjustment impact\n</td> <td>(27.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Variation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContribution Margin - Gas Utility contribution margin was $939.0 for fiscal 2017, a $94.6 increase over the same period last year.

These positive impacts offset the negative impact of weather and temperature adjustments. Temperatures in the Spire Missouri territory experienced degree days that were 1% warmer than last year and 20% warmer than normal. Degree days in the Spire Alabama service areas in fiscal 2017 were 15% warmer than the prior year, and 35% warmer than normal. Temperatures are a significant part of the Utilities' rate cases, contributing to the constrained margins experienced in the current year.\nOperating Expenses - Depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $16.6 from the same period last year, $10.0 the result of the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, $4.5 due to Spire Missouri and $2.1 relating to Spire Alabama, principally the result of continued infrastructure capital spending in fiscal 2017. O&M expenses increased $29.8 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $33.5 increase relating to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, O&M expenses were $3.7 below prior year levels due primarily to lower employee-related costs that were only partly offset by higher professional services. The employee labor-costs were favorably impacted by the warmer weather experienced in both the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama service territories. Taxes other than income taxes were $12.6 higher in the current year, with $7.6 of the increase attributable to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition. $4.2 of the increase was related to the higher gross receipt taxes due to the higher revenues, with the remainder of the variance related to property tax expense at Spire Missouri.\nGas Marketing\nOperating Revenues - Gas Marketing operating revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $0.8 from the same period last year. The variance in revenues reflects the impact of higher total volumes and higher commodity pricing levels offset by the effect of increased trading activities, and unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives. Under GAAP, revenues associated with trading activities are presented net of related costs. Average pricing for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 was approximately $2.897/MMBtu versus approximately $2.286/MMBtu for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.611/MMBtu.\nContribution Margin - Gas Marketing contribution margin was $11.6 for fiscal 2017, a $6.1 decrease compared to the same period last year, with that variance significantly impacted by unfavorable fair value adjustments on derivative holdings in the current year, and favorable adjustments in the prior year. Removing these fair value adjustments from both periods, contribution margin is $0.7 higher than last year, reflecting favorable wholesale trading volumes and storage optimization.\nOther\nOther operating revenue increased $2.9 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, driven by higher reinsurance premiums. Other operating expenses were essentially flat with the prior year, as an increase in costs related to the reinsurance premiums was offset by a decrease in corporate-level integration expenses.\nInterest Charges\nConsolidated interest charges during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $11.9 versus the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by the debt incurred and assumed as a result of the Spire EnergySouth acquisition generating interest expense of $8.5, combined with marginally higher interest rates on floating rate debt in the first six months of the year and higher interest rates on the senior notes issued in March of this year that were used to retire the $250.0 of floating rate debt. Also, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, average short-term borrowings were $485.8 and $273.9, respectively, and the average interest rates on these borrowings were 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nConsolidated income tax expense increased $8.1 in fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The current year effective tax rate of 32.4% was essentially flat versus fiscal 2016's effective rate of 32.5%.\nSpire Missouri\nSummary Operating Results\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended September 30,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operation and maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>243.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>93.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Taxes, other than income taxes\n</td> <td>99.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Less: Gross receipts tax expense\n</td> <td>(60.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Contribution Margin (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>573.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>558.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Natural and propane gas costs\n</td> <td>538.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>471.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Gross receipts tax expense\n</td> <td>60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,171.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,087.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating revenues during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $84.4 from the same period last year. Revenues were impacted primarily by higher gas costs of $50.9 passed on to customers, $17.9 higher off- system and capacity release sales, higher ISRS charges of $14.2, and higher gross receipts taxes of $3.3. These impacts were slightly offset by negative weather impacts.\nContribution margin for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $14.8 from the same period last year. Higher ISRS charges of $14.2 were only partly offset by a negative $2.6 weather impact attributable to the 1% warmer weather experienced in the current year.\nO&M for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 were $0.6 lower than the prior year. Lower employment-related costs were almost completely offset by higher professional services. Depreciation and amortization increased $4.5, reflecting continued infrastructure investments throughout Missouri. Interest expense in the current year was $1.7 greater than prior year, the result of a combination of higher short-term borrowings and higher average effective interest rates. Income taxes were $2.1 higher for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 versus the comparable prior year period due to higher pre-tax book income, mitigated by a slightly lower effective tax rate.\nTemperatures experienced in the Missouri Utilities' service area during fiscal 2017 were 1% warmer than the same period last year and 20% warmer than normal. Normal temperatures are part of Spire Missouri's rate case design, meaning the warmer than normal temperatures continued to constrain margins. Total system therms sold and transported were 1,482.1 million for fiscal 2017 compared with 1,479.3 million for fiscal 2016. Total off-system therms sold and transported outside of Spire Missouri's service area were 175.6 million for fiscal 2017 compared with 183.3 million for fiscal 2016.\nSpire Alabama\nSummary Operating Results\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended September 30,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operation and maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>130.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>49.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Taxes, other than income taxes\n</td> <td>29.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Less: Gross receipts tax expense\n</td> <td>(19.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Contribution Margin (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>296.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>283.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Natural and propane gas costs\n</td> <td>84.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Gross receipts tax expense\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>368.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $32.0 versus the comparable period ended September 30, 2016. Of the increase, $19.2 of the increase related to lower RSE return on equity revenue adjustments and higher CCM benefits in the current year, $11.2 resulted from weather/temperature adjustments, along with slightly higher gross receipts taxes of $1.6.\nContribution margin increased $13.2 versus prior year, as $19.2 in favorable RSE, CCM adjustments and return on capital more than offset negative weather and usage impacts of $6.0. Contributing to the favorable current year RSE return on equity adjustment impact was a fiscal 2016 reduction in revenues relating to a legal settlement of $6.0. There was no impact to net income, as this revenue adjustment offset a corresponding $6.0 gain recorded in other income.\nO&M expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 decreased $3.1 versus the year ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in other operating expenses was driven primarily by lower employee-related costs, which were favorably impacted by the warmer weather in the current year. Depreciation and amortization was $2.1 higher versus the same period last year, the result of continued infrastructure investment throughout Spire Alabama's service territory. Income tax expense increased $3.4, primarily due to the higher pre-tax book income earned in the current year.\nTemperatures in Spire Alabama's service area during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 were 35% warmer than normal and 15% warmer than the same period a year earlier. Spire Alabama's total therms sold and transported were 900.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017, compared with 878.1 million for the same period last year.\nFor further information on the GSA, RSE and CCM mechanisms, please see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 15, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Financial Statements.\n2016 vs. 2015\nSpire\nConsolidated\nSpire's net income was $144.2 in fiscal 2016, compared with $136.9 in fiscal 2015. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $3.26 and $3.24, respectively, for fiscal 2016 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $3.16 for fiscal 2015. Net economic earnings were $149.1 (or $3.42 per share) in fiscal 2016, compared with $138.3 (or $3.19 per share) in fiscal 2015. Net income increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to $5.7 income growth in the Gas Utility segment and $3.0 income growth in the Gas Marketing segment, partly offset by a $1.4 larger loss from other activities.\nGas Utility\nGas Utility net income and net economic earnings increased by $5.7 and $9.9, respectively, in fiscal 2016, compared to 2015. The increases to net income and net economic earnings were driven by higher ISRS charges at Spire Missouri and net favorable regulatory adjustments at Spire Alabama, partly offset by lower volumes resulting from warmer winter temperatures. The segment also benefited from a decrease in O&M, which includes effects of the warmer weather. These impacts were partly offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, interest expense was higher due to the increase experienced by Spire Missouri. Income taxes were also higher due to higher pre-tax income for both the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama.\nGas Marketing\nGas Marketing reported net income totaling $7.1 in fiscal 2016, an increase of $3.0 compared to fiscal 2015. Net economic earnings for fiscal 2016 increased $2.2 from fiscal 2015. The increases in net income and net economic earnings were primarily attributable to increases in contribution margin, with the impact to net economic earnings being partly offset by mark-to-market activity as discussed in the Gas Marketing section below.\nOther\nThe combined increase in net loss and net economic loss for the Company's other non-utility activities were $1.4 and $1.3, respectively, for fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of higher interest charges.\nOperating Revenues and Operating Expenses\nReconciliations of the Company's contribution margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are shown above.\nConsolidated\nSpire reported operating revenues of $1,537.3 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared with $1,976.4 for the same prior year period. The decrease was driven primarily by the Utilities, the result of lower volumes and lower gas costs passed on to customers. Spire's contribution margin increased $7.1 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher contribution margin of $5.0 and $2.3 for the Gas Marketing and Gas Utility segments, respectively, slightly offset by the lower contribution margin reported in Other. O&M expenses decreased $9.4 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, as discussed below. The decrease in O&M expenses was partially offset by $6.7 higher depreciation and amortization expense, driven principally by continued infrastructure investment at the Utilities in fiscal 2016.\nGas Utility\nOperating Revenues - Gas Utility Operating Revenues for fiscal 2016 decreased $436.4 compared to fiscal 2015, and was primarily attributable to the following factors:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower wholesale gas costs passed on to customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(262.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower system sales volumes\n</td> <td>(147.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri - Lower off-system sales and capacity release\n</td> <td>(25.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lower gross receipts tax\n</td> <td>(21.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Missouri - Higher ISRS charges\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spire Alabama - Lower RSE revenue adjustments\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New customer revenue from Spire EnergySouth acquisition\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Variation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(436.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContribution Margin - Gas Utility contribution margin was $844.4 for fiscal 2016, a $2.3 increase over the same period of fiscal 2015.

A $6.0 gain related to a legal settlement was recorded in other income, but contribution margin was reduced by a revenue adjustment corresponding to the $6.0 gain, resulting in no impact on net income. Temperatures in the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama service areas in fiscal 2016 were 19.7% and 30% warmer than in the same period in the prior year, respectively, significantly contributing to the $18.0 negative volume impact on contribution margin in fiscal 2016.\nOperating Expenses - Depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 increased $7.0 from the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, due principally to continued infrastructure capital spending in fiscal 2016. O&M expenses decreased $8.4 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of a $7.6 gain on the sale of property in 2015, O&M expenses were $16.0 below 2015 levels due primarily to lower bad debt expense (reflecting the impact of warmer weather experienced during the heating season) and employee-related costs.\nGas Marketing\nOperating Revenues - Gas Marketing operating revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $74.9 from the same prior year period. The decrease in revenues reflects the impact of higher total volumes being more than offset by lower commodity pricing levels, the effect of increased trading activities, and favorable mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives. Average pricing for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $2.286/MMBtu versus approximately $3.066/MMBtu for 2015, a $0.781 decline.\nContribution Margin - Gas Marketing contribution margin was $17.7 for fiscal 2016, a $5.0 increase compared to fiscal 2015. Favorable wholesale trading volumes and storage optimization resulted in an $11.7 increase more than offsetting $7.9 of negative pricing impacts. Fair value adjustments accounted for an additional $1.2 favorable impact in fiscal 2016.\nOther\nOperating Revenue and Operating Expenses - Other operating revenue increased $1.1 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in fiscal 2015, reflecting higher insurance revenues. Other O&M expenses were essentially flat with the prior year.\nInterest Charges\nInterest charges during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 increased $2.6 from fiscal 2015. Interest expense reductions from the refinancing of $115.0 in Spire Alabama long-term debt in September and December of 2015, along with lower average short-term borrowings, have been offset by higher rates on short-term borrowings, interest on debt issued to finance the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, interest on acquired debt, and charges related to a temporary bridge facility commitment obtained and terminated during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 related to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, average short-term borrowings were $273.9 and $300.6, respectively, and the average interest rates on those borrowings were 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nConsolidated income tax expense increased $7.3 in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a higher effective tax rate. The fiscal 2016 effective tax rate of 32.5% is approximately 1.3 percentage points higher than the rate for fiscal 2015. The higher fiscal 2016 rate includes tax expense associated with a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our financial statements:\nRegulatory Accounting - The Utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, Regulated Operations.\u201d The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). Management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of these regulatory accounting principles and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. For Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, management believes the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance:\nPGA Clause - Spire Missouri's PGA clauses allows the Missouri Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to a prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including the costs, cost reductions, and related carrying costs associated with the Missouri Utilities' use of natural gas derivative instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas. The difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period. The PGA clauses also permit the application of carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, and also provide for a portion of income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues to be flowed through to customers. Spire Missouri's PGA clauses also authorizes it to recover costs it incurs to finance its investment in gas supplies that are purchased during the storage injection season for sale during the heating season.\nGSA Rider - Spire Alabama's rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider, established in 1993, which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabama's tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA, that is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabama's earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. In prior years, Spire Alabama entered into cash flow derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on its gas supply. Spire Alabama recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Any realized gains or losses are passed through to customers using the mechanisms of the GSA rider in accordance with Spire Alabama's APSC approved tariff and are recognized as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. All derivative commodity instruments in a gain position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to each related counterparty. Derivative commodity instruments in a loss position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to Spire Alabama. Spire Alabama currently has no active gas supply derivative positions.\nGoodwill - Goodwill is measured as the excess of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred over the amount of acquisition-date identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities, and adjustments are recorded during the measurement period to finalize the allocation of purchase price. Spire Missouri has recorded goodwill related to the 2013 acquisition of Spire Missouri West, and Spire also has recorded goodwill related to the 2016 and 2014 acquisitions of Spire EnergySouth and Spire Alabama, respectively. Neither Spire EnergySouth nor Spire Alabama have goodwill on their balance sheets as push down accounting was not applied. Spire and Spire Missouri evaluate goodwill for impairment as of July 1 of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. At July 1, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Spire and Spire Missouri each applied a quantitative goodwill evaluation model to their reporting units and concluded goodwill was not impaired because the fair value exceeded the carrying amounts.\nEmployee Benefits and Postretirement Obligations - Pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions provided by management related to future events, such as discount rates, returns on plan assets, compensation increases, and mortality rates. For the Utilities, the amount of expense recognized and the amounts reflected in other comprehensive income are dependent upon the regulatory treatment provided for such costs, as discussed further below. Certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers' compensation claims, portions of which are self-insured and/or contain stop-loss\u201d coverage with third-party insurers to limit exposure, are established based on historical trends.\nThe amount of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs recognized in the financial statements related to the Utilities' qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based upon allowances, as approved by the MoPSC (for Spire Missouri) and as approved by the APSC (for Spire Alabama). The allowances have been established in the rate-making process for the recovery of these costs from customers. The differences between these amounts and actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs incurred for financial reporting purposes are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. GAAP also requires that changes that affect the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans, but that are not yet required to be recognized as components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs, be reflected in other comprehensive income. For the Utilities' qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, amounts that would otherwise be reflected in other comprehensive income are deferred with entries to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.\nThe tables below reflect the sensitivity of Spire's plans to potential changes in key assumptions:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension Plan Benefits:\nActuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/ (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Increase/ (Decrease) to Projected Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Increase/ (Decrease) to Annual Net Pension Cost*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected Return on Plan Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of Future Compensation Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postretirement Benefits:\nActuarial Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase/ (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Increase/ (Decrease) to Projected Postretirement Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Increase/ (Decrease) to Annual Net Postretirement Benefit Cost*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected Return on Plan Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual Medical Cost Trend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.00\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Excludes the impact of regulatory deferral mechanism.

On November 29, 2016, MoPSC staff recommended $4.5 and $3.4 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively, based on updated filings. On January 3, 2017, the MoPSC held a hearing to decide two issues raised by the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel (OPC) pertaining to the ISRS eligibility of hydrostatic testing done by Spire Missouri West and of the replacement of cast iron main interspersed with portions of plastic pipe. On January 18, 2017, the MoPSC found in favor of the Missouri Utilities on the interspersed plastics issue, but against Spire Missouri West on hydrostatic testing, and issued an order setting the ISRS increases at $4.5 and $3.2 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively, bringing total annualized ISRS revenue to $29.5 and $13.4, respectively. Rates were effective January 28, 2017. On March 3, 2017, the OPC filed an appeal to Missouri's Western District Court of Appeals of the MoPSC's decision permitting Spire Missouri to include in the ISRS the replacement of cast iron main interspersed with plastic pipe. The appeal will be heard in November 2017.\nOn February 3, 2017, Spire Missouri filed to increase its ISRS revenues, by $3.3 for Spire Missouri East and $2.9 for Spire Missouri West, related to ISRS investments from November 2016 through February 2017. Following the submission of updated information, on April 4, 2017, MoPSC staff submitted its recommendation for an increase in rates of approximately $3.0 each, for a cumulative total of $32.6 and $16.4 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively. On that same date, the OPC again raised an objection to the ISRS eligibility of replacing cast iron main interspersed with portions of plastic. On April 18, 2017, the parties filed with the MoPSC a unanimous stipulation and agreement proposing to apply the judicial outcome of the OPC's March 3, 2017 appeal on the plastics issue to both the ISRS cases on appeal and the current ISRS cases. The agreement was approved by the MoPSC on April 26, 2017. ISRS rates for each of the two service territories were increased by the MoPSC staff-recommended amounts, effective June 1, 2017.\nOn April 15, 2015, Spire Missouri applied to the MoPSC for a new authorization of long-term financing in the amount of $550.0. On February 10, 2016, the MoPSC issued an order, by a 3-2 vote, authorizing Spire Missouri financing authority of $300.0 for long-term financings placed any time before September 30, 2018. Spire Missouri filed an application for rehearing, which was denied on March 9, 2016. On March 31, 2016, Spire Missouri filed an appeal with Missouri's Western District Court of Appeals concerning this matter. The parties filed briefs and oral arguments were heard on November 17, 2016. On May 30, 2017, Missouri's Western District Court of Appeals issued a decision upholding the MoPSC's February 10, 2016 Order granting Spire Missouri $300.0 in long-term financing authority. On July 5, 2017, the Court denied Spire Missouri's request to transfer the case to the Missouri Supreme Court, and on October 5, 2017, the Missouri Supreme Court declined to hear Spire Missouri's direct appeal. On March 20, 2017, Spire Missouri entered into a bond purchase agreement for $170.0 that was funded on September 15, 2017, and applied against the $300.0 authorization.\nOn April 11, 2017, both Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West filed for a general rate case, and did so concurrently as agreed to in GM-2013-0254, as part of the acquisition of Spire Missouri West by Spire Missouri in fiscal 2013. The request for Spire Missouri East represents a net rate increase of $25.5. With the $32.6 already being billed in ISRS, the total base rate increase request was $58.1. Spire Missouri West's request represents a net rate increase of $34.0. With the $16.4 already being billed in ISRS, the total base rate increase request was $50.4. The rates were premised upon a 10.35% return on equity and the details of the filing can be found in GR-2017-0215 and GR-2017-0216 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively. An evidentiary hearing has been set for December 4 through 15, 2017, with a MoPSC decision expected by February 2018. Missouri statutes require new rates to be effective within 11 months of the filing, or by March 8, 2018.\nSpire Alabama\nSpire Alabama is subject to regulation by the APSC which established the RSE rate-setting process in 1983. Spire Alabama's current RSE order has a term extending beyond September 30, 2018, unless the APSC enters an order to the contrary in a manner consistent with law. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, whether physical or economic, of the nature of force majeure and including a change in control, the APSC and Spire Alabama will consult in good faith with respect to modifications, if any. Effective January 1, 2014, Spire Alabama's allowed range of return on average common equity is 10.5% to 10.95% with an adjusting point of 10.8%. Spire Alabama is eligible to receive a performance-based adjustment of 5 basis points to the return on equity adjusting point, based on meeting certain customer satisfaction criteria. Under RSE, the APSC conducts quarterly reviews to determine whether Spire Alabama's return on average common equity at the end of the rate year will be within the allowed range of return. Reductions in rates can be made quarterly to bring the projected return within the allowed range;\nincreases, however, are allowed only once each rate year, effective December 1, and cannot exceed 4% of prior-year revenues. The RSE reduction for the July 31, 2016 quarterly point of test was $4.8 and went into effect October 1, 2016, and for the quarterly point of test at September 30, 2016, Spire Alabama recorded a $2.7 RSE reduction effective December 1, 2016. As part of the annual update for RSE, on November 30, 2016, Spire Alabama filed a reduction for rate year 2017 of $2.5 that also became effective December 1, 2016. There was no RSE reduction for the January 31, 2017, April 30, 2017 and July 31, 2017 points of test. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Alabama recorded a $2.7 RSE reduction to operating revenues to bring the expected rate of return on average common equity at the end of the year to within the allowed range of return.\nThe inflation-based CCM, established by the APSC, allows for annual increases to O&M expense. The CCM range is Spire Alabama's 2007 actual rate year O&M expense inflation-adjusted using the June Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) each rate year plus or minus 1.75% (Index Range). If rate year O&M expense falls within the Index Range, no adjustment is required. If rate year O&M expense exceeds the Index Range, three-quarters of the difference is returned to customers through future rate adjustments. To the extent rate year O&M is less than the Index Range, Spire Alabama benefits by one-half of the difference through future rate adjustments. Certain items that fluctuate based on situations demonstrated to be beyond Spire Alabama's control may be excluded from the CCM calculation. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Alabama recorded a CCM benefit of $10.7 for rate year 2017, which will be reflected in rates effective December 1, 2017. The CCM benefit was $7.8 for rate year 2016 and $4.7 for rate year 2015.\nOn June 28, 2010, the APSC approved a reduction in depreciation rates, effective June 1, 2010, and a regulatory liability recorded for Spire Alabama. Refunds from such negative salvage liability will be passed back to eligible customers on a declining basis through lower tariff rates through rate year 2019 pursuant to the terms of the Negative Salvage Rebalancing (NSR) rider. The total amount refundable to customers is subject to adjustments over the remaining period for charges made to the Enhanced Stability Reserve (ESR) and other APSC-approved charges. The refunds are due to a re-estimation of future removal costs provided for through the prior depreciation rates. For fiscal 2017, approximately $6.3 of the customer refund was returned to customers. As of September 30, 2017, $12.3 is remaining to be refunded to customers. The NSR pass back for fiscal 2018 is $8.2 and will be reflected in rates effective December 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018.\nThe APSC approved an ESR in 1998, which was subsequently modified and expanded in 2010. As currently approved, the ESR provides deferred treatment and recovery for the following: (1) extraordinary O&M expenses related to environmental response costs; (2) extraordinary O&M expenses related to self-insurance costs that exceed $1.0 per occurrence; (3) extraordinary O&M expenses, other than environmental response costs and self-insurance costs, resulting from a single force majeure event or multiple force majeure events greater than $0.3 and $0.4, respectively, during a rate year; and (4) negative individual large commercial and industrial customer budget revenue variances that exceed $0.4 during a rate year. Charges to the ESR are subject to certain limitations which may disallow deferred treatment and which prescribe the timing of recovery. Funding to the ESR is provided as a reduction to the refundable negative salvage balance over its nine-year term beginning December 1, 2010. Subsequent to the nine-year period and subject to APSC authorization, Spire Alabama expects to be able to recover underfunded ESR balances over a five-year amortization period with an annual limitation of $0.7. Amounts in excess of this limitation are deferred for recovery in future years.\nSpire Alabama has APSC approval for an intercompany revolving credit agreement allowing Spire Alabama to borrow from Spire in a principal amount not to exceed $200.0 at any time outstanding in combination with its bank line of credit, and to loan to Spire in a principal amount not to exceed $25.0 at any time outstanding. Borrowings may be used for the following purposes: (a) meeting increased working capital requirements; (b) financing construction requirements related to additions, extensions, and replacements of the distribution systems; and (c) financing other expenditures that may arise from time to time in the normal course of business.\nOn September 18, 2017, Spire Alabama filed an application with the APSC for authorization to issue and sell $75.0 principal amount of debt and to purchase interest rate derivative instruments for the purpose of locking in favorable interest rates and to include the associated interest charges, issuance costs, fees and any gain or loss resulting from the settlement of such interest rate derivative instruments through rates. The application was approved by the APSC October 3, 2017.\nSpire\nIn addition to the matters described above, the following regulatory matters affect Spire.\nSpire Gulf has similar rate regulation to Spire Alabama. The RSE allowed range of return on average common equity is 10.45% to 10.95% with an adjusting point of 10.7%. The CCM has the same return and similar recovery provisions when expenses exceed or are under a band of +/- 1.50% around the CPI-U inflated O&M per customer expense level from September 30, 2017, excluding expenses for pensions and gas bad debt. Additionally, it has a Cast Iron Main Replacement (CIMR) factor that provides an enhanced return on the pro-rata costs associated with cast iron main replacement for miles over 10 miles per year based on a 75% weighting for the equity content. Spire Gulf also has an ESR for negative revenue variances over $o.1 or a force majeure event expense of $0.1 (or two events that exceed $0.15), a Self Insurance Reserve (SIR) for general liability coverage, and an Environmental Cost Recovery Factor (ECRF) as part of its PGA that recovers 90% of prudently incurred costs for compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations. It also has an APSC-approved intercompany revolving credit agreement with Spire to borrow in a principal amount not to exceed $50.0, and to loan up to $25.0.\nOn September 21, 2017, Spire Gulf filed an application to defer certain pension and post-retirement health plan costs. The application was approved by the APSC October 3, 2017.\nSpire Mississippi utilizes a formula rate-making process under the Rate Stabilization Adjustment (RSA) Rider. It is based on a formulaically derived return on equity, and is updated on an annual basis if the equity return on an end of period rate base is beyond the allowed return on equity by 1.0%, with 75% of any shortfall back to the midpoint being put into a rate increase and 50% of any excess back to the midpoint resulting in a rate decrease. Updates are made based on known and measurable adjustments to historic costs from 12-months ended June 30, submitted September 15 for an effective date of November 1, unless disputed by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff, with any disputes to be resolved by the MSPSC by January 15 of the following year. Spire Mississippi had approved December 3, 2015 a Supplemental Growth Rider (SGR) for a 3-year period to provide enhanced returns of a 12.0% return on equity for a period of 10 years on certain system expansion projects.\nIn July 2016, the proposed project of Spire STL Pipeline LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire, was accepted into the pre-filing process at the FERC. The proposal outlined the plan to build, own, operate, and maintain a pipeline interconnecting with the Rockies Express pipeline to deliver natural gas to the St. Louis, Missouri area. As an interstate project, the Spire STL Pipeline is being reviewed for siting and permitting by the FERC, which is the lead agency for other federal, state, and local permitting authorities. In January 2017, Spire submitted an application with the FERC requesting issuance of a certificate of convenience and necessity authorizing it to construct, own, and operate an interstate pipeline. Several parties have filed interventions and comments regarding the Spire STL Pipeline project. The company is monitoring these closely and has responded where appropriate. In April 2017, Spire STL Pipeline filed an amended certificate application to adjust the preferred route to include a new six-mile segment rather than an existing line, offering a number of benefits including eliminating potential supply disruption risk for Spire Missouri during construction, eliminating uncertainty regarding upgrade costs, and reducing long-term integrity management costs. In its Environmental Assessment issued on September 29, 2017, the FERC concluded that approval of the Spire STL Pipeline, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Spire anticipates the FERC will deliver a Final Order by the end of calendar year 2017.\nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThe Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have evaluated or are in the process of evaluating the impact that recently issued accounting standards will have on their financial position or results of operations upon adoption. For disclosures related to the adoption of new accounting standards, see the New Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nINFLATION\nThe accompanying financial statements reflect the historical costs of events and transactions, regardless of the purchasing power of the dollar at the time. Due to the capital-intensive nature of the businesses of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, the most significant impact of inflation is on the depreciation of utility plant. Rate regulation, to which the Utilities are subject, allows recovery through its rates of only the historical cost of utility plant as depreciation. The Utilities expect to incur significant capital expenditures in future years, primarily related to the planned increased replacements of distribution plant. The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama believe that any higher costs experienced upon replacement of existing facilities will be recovered through the normal regulatory process.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nCASH FLOWS\nThe Company's short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when the Utilities borrow money to cover the lag between when they purchase natural gas and when their customers pay for that gas. Changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas (including cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri's use of natural gas derivative instruments), variations in the timing of collections of gas cost under the Utilities' PGA clauses and GSA riders, the seasonality of accounts receivable balances, and the utilization of storage gas inventories cause short-term cash requirements to vary during the year and from year to year, and may cause significant variations in the Company's cash provided by or used in operating activities.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flow Summary\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(433.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(612.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(298.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>147.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $39.9 from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The change is primarily due to fluctuations in working capital, as mentioned above, largely driven by the relative weather conditions and gas prices during the periods. Cash was provided by increases in accounts payable, net income, depreciation, and deferred income taxes. These benefits were more than offset by a net decrease in advance customer billings and net increases in accounts receivable and natural gas inventory values.\nThe Company used $179.2 less cash in investing activities in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016 but $134.8 more than in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 included $317.7 net cash used for the acquisition of Spire EnergySouth, while fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2015 included only smaller acquisition settlements. Capital expenditures increased $144.8 from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the higher level of infrastructure upgrades across both Missouri and Alabama, as well as $16.0 from the addition of EnergySouth and $25.5 for the Spire STL Pipeline project. Spire estimates its capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 will be approximately $485.0, including approximately $415.0 for the Utilities. The increase in investment reflects the continued commitment to infrastructure upgrades at the Utilities and the beginning of the construction phase of the Spire STL Pipeline.\nCash provided by financing activities was $128.5 lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016. This change primarily reflects the effect of a $26.2 net issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017 compared with a $165.0 net issuance the previous year, while short-term borrowings continued to increase, reflecting the Company's growing operations. Stock issuances in fiscal 2017, which included the conversion of equity units issued in 2014, provided $9.7 more cash than last year, which included the offering to help fund the Spire EnergySouth acquisition. These net cash inflows were partially offset by continued increases in dividend payments and other financing activities this year. In fiscal 2015, the net issuances of long-term debt and common stock were not significant. In the first half of fiscal 2018, Spire Alabama plans to issue long-term notes totaling $75.0. Spire Missouri expects to refinance $100.0 of bonds due in August 2018.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nBank deposits were used to support working capital needs of the business. Spire had no temporary cash investments as of September 30, 2017 or 2016. Due to lower yields available to Spire on short-term investments, the Company elected to provide a portion of Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's short-term funding through intercompany lending during the past fiscal year.\nShort-term Debt\nThe Utilities' short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during the colder months, while the Company's needs are less seasonal. These short-term cash requirements can be met through the sale of commercial paper or through the use of a revolving credit facility.\nOn December 14, 2016, Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama entered into a new syndicated revolving credit facility pursuant to a loan agreement with 11 banks, expiring December 14, 2021. The largest portion provided by a single bank under the line is 12.3%. The loan agreement replaced Spire's and Spire Missouri's existing loan agreements dated as of September 3, 2013 and amended September 3, 2014, which were set to expire on September 3, 2019, and Spire Alabama's existing loan agreement dated September 2, 2014, which was set to expire September 2, 2019. All three previous agreements were terminated on December 14, 2016.\nThe loan agreement has an aggregate credit commitment of $975.0, including sublimits of $300.0 for Spire, $475.0 for Spire Missouri, and $200.0 for Spire Alabama. These sublimits may be reallocated from time to time among the three borrowers within the $975.0 aggregate commitment. Spire may use its line to provide for the funding needs of various subsidiaries. Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama expect to use the loan agreement for general corporate purposes, including short-term borrowings and letters of credit. The agreement also contains financial covenants limiting each borrower's consolidated total debt, including short-term debt, to no more than 70% of its total capitalization. As defined in the line of credit, on September 30, 2017, total debt was 56% of total capitalization for the consolidated Company, 50% for Spire Missouri, and 33% for Spire Alabama. There were no borrowings against this credit facility as of September 30, 2017.\nOn December 21, 2016, Spire established a commercial paper program (Program) pursuant to which Spire may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (Notes). Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $975.0. The Notes may have maturities of up to 365 days from date of issue. The net proceeds of the issuances of the Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including to provide working capital for both utility and non-utility subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2017, Notes outstanding under the Program totaled $477.3.\nInformation about Spire's consolidated short-term borrowings is presented in the following table. Based on average short-term borrowings for the year ended September 30, 2017, an increase in the average interest rate of 100 basis points would decrease Spire's pre-tax earnings and cash flows by approximately $4.9 on an annual basis, portions of which may be offset through the application of PGA or GSA carrying costs.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Spire\nShort-term Borrowings1\n</td> <td>Spire Missouri\nCommercial Paper Borrowings2\n</td> <td>Spire Alabama\nBank Line Borrowings\n</td> <td>Total\nShort-term Borrowings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$369.0\n</td> <td>$88.5\n</td> <td>$28.3\n</td> <td>$485.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>1.3%\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> <td>1.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Range of borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$73.0 - $675.6\n</td> <td>$0.0 - $329.7\n</td> <td>$0.0 - $102.5\n</td> <td>$395.5 - $675.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$477.3\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> <td>$477.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$42.7\n</td> <td>$201.0\n</td> <td>$30.2\n</td> <td>$273.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> <td>0.7%\n</td> <td>1.4%\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Range of borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$0.0 - $82.0\n</td> <td>$43.0 - $307.2\n</td> <td>$0.0 - $82.0\n</td> <td>$73.1 - $427.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings outstanding\n</td> <td>$73.0\n</td> <td>$243.7\n</td> <td>$82.0\n</td> <td>$398.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>1.8%\n</td> <td>0.8%\n</td> <td>1.5%\n</td> <td>1.1%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1 Spire Short-term Borrowings includes bank line borrowings of Spire Inc. (excluding its subsidiaries) and, since January 1, 2017, commercial paper. Of Spire's $477.3 borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2017, $440.0 was used to provide funding to its subsidiaries, including Spire Missouri ($203.0), Spire Alabama ($169.9), Spire EnergySouth and subsidiaries ($12.9), Spire STL Pipeline LLC ($26.6), and others ($27.6).  2 The commercial paper program for Spire Missouri terminated February 2, 2017.\nLong-term Debt and Equity\nAt September 30, 2017, including the current portion but excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, Spire had long-term debt totaling $2,112.0, of which $980.0 was issued by Spire Missouri, $250.0 was issued by Spire Alabama, and $67.0 was issued by other subsidiaries. All long-term debt bears fixed rates and is subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases and decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities' regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemption of long-term debt typically would be deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities and amortized over a future period.\nOf the Company's $2,112.0 long-term debt (including the current portion), $25.0 has no call options, $1,037.0 has make-whole call options, $5.0 is callable currently, and $1,045.0 is callable at par one to six months prior to maturity.\nMaturities of long-term debt for Spire on a consolidated basis, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama for the five fiscal years subsequent to September 30, 2017 are as follows:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Spire\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Spire Missouri\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Spire Alabama\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>180.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>40.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>55.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSpire's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's short-term credit facilities and long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants and default provisions. As of September 30, 2017, there were no events of default under these covenants.\nThe Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs, may depend on the credit rating of the entity that is accessing the capital markets. The credit ratings of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama remain at investment grade, but are subject to review and change by the rating agencies.\nIt is management's view that the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have adequate access to capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources, both internal and external, to meet anticipated capital requirements, which primarily include capital expenditures, interest payments on long-term debt, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, short-term seasonal needs, and dividends.\nOn March 10, 2017, Spire redeemed in full at par its $250.0 floating rate notes due August 15, 2017, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn March 15, 2017, Spire completed the issuance and sale of $100.0 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2027. The notes bear interest at the rate of 3.93% per annum, payable semi-annually. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the notes for the repayment of other debt.\nIn 2014, Spire issued 2.875 million equity units as a portion of the Spire Alabama acquisition financing. The equity units were originally issued at $50 per unit pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (Purchase Contract) dated as of June 11, 2014 between Spire and U.S. Bank National Association, as purchase contract agent, collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary. These units consisted of $143.8 aggregate principal amount of 2014 Series A 2.00% remarketable junior subordinated notes due 2022 (the Junior Notes) and the Purchase Contract obligating the holder to purchase common shares at a future settlement date (anticipated to be three years in the future and prior to the Junior Notes maturity).\nThe equity unit investments were effectively replaced as planned in a series of transactions outlined below:\n \u2022 On February 22, 2017, the selling securityholders (as defined below) agreed to purchase the Junior Notes in connection with the remarketing of the junior subordinated notes that comprised a component of the equity units. \n \u2022 On the same day, Spire entered two related agreements: (1) a Securities Purchase and Registration Rights Agreement (the SPRRA), among Spire and the several purchasers named therein (the selling securityholders), obligating the selling securityholders to sell the Junior Notes to Spire in exchange for $143.8 aggregate principal amount of Spire's 3.543% Senior Notes due 2024 (the Senior Notes) and a cash payment, and (2) an underwriting agreement with the selling securityholders and the several underwriters named therein in connection with the public offering of $150.0 aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes consisting of $6.2 principal amount of the Senior Notes issued and sold by Spire and $143.8 principal amount of the Senior Notes sold by the selling securityholders. The SPRRA granted the selling securityholders the right to offer the Senior Notes to the public in secondary public offerings. \n \u2022 The public offering was completed on February 27, 2017. Spire used its net proceeds from its sale of the Senior Notes to repay short-term debt. Spire did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes by the selling securityholders. \n \u2022 On April 3, 2017, Spire settled the Purchase Contracts underlying its 2.875 million equity units by issuing 2,504,684 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $57.3921 per share. Fractional shares were settled in cash at $67.50 per share. The purchase price was funded with the proceeds of the Junior Notes. Under the contract term, the equity units were converted to common stock at the rate of 0.8712, with a corresponding adjustment to purchase price. Spire received net cash proceeds of approximately $142.0, which it used to repay short-term debt incurred the previous month to redeem the floating rate notes.  On September 15, 2017, Spire Missouri issued and sold in a private placement $50.0 in aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due September 15, 2032, $70.0 in aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due September 15, 2047 and $50.0 in aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due September 15, 2057. Spire Missouri used the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. The 2032 bonds, 2047 bonds and 2057 bonds bear interest at a rate per annum of 3.68%, 4.23% and 4.38%, respectively, payable semi-annually on the 15th day of March and September of each year.\nSpire Missouri has authority from the MoPSC to issue debt securities and preferred stock, including on a private placement basis, as well as to issue common stock, receive paid-in-capital, and enter into capital lease agreements, all for a total of up to $300.0 for financings placed any time before September 30, 2018. During the year ended September 30, 2017, Spire Missouri issued $170.0 in securities under this authorization, so as of that date, $130.0 remains available to be issued.\nSpire has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the issuance and sale of up to 250,000 shares of common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan. There were 244,130 and 239,945 at September 30, 2017 and November 10, 2017, respectively, remaining available for issuance under this Form S-3. Spire also has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of equity and debt securities. Spire Missouri has a shelf registration on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for issuance of first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt, and preferred stock, which expires on September 22, 2019.\nIncluding the current portion of long-term debt, the Company's capitalization at September 30, 2017 consisted of 48.7% of common stock equity and 51.3% long-term debt, compared to 46.1% of common stock equity and 53.9% of long-term debt at September 30, 2016.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAs of September 30, 2017, Spire had contractual obligations with payments due as summarized below:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal Payments on Long-term Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,112.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,687.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Payments on Long-term Debt (a)\n</td> <td>1,242.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases (b)\n</td> <td>83.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations - Natural Gas (c)\n</td> <td>1,281.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>703.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>373.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations - Other (d)\n</td> <td>74.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Retirement Obligations\n</td> <td>296.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (e)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,091.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>972.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>803.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,967.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt. Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate and outstanding principal for each instrument with the terms ending at each instrument's stated maturity. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Financial Statements. \n (b) Lease obligations are primarily for office space, vehicles, and power operated equipment. Additional payments will be incurred if renewal options are exercised under the provisions of certain agreements. \n (c) These purchase obligations represent the minimum payments required under existing natural gas transportation and storage contracts and natural gas supply agreements in the Gas Utility and Gas Marketing segments. These amounts reflect fixed obligations as well as obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using September 30, 2017 forward market prices. Each of the Utilities generally recovers costs related to its purchases, transportation, and storage of natural gas through the operation of its PGA clause or GSA rider, subject to prudence review by the appropriate regional public service commission. Variations in the timing of collections of gas costs from customers may affect short-term cash requirements. Additional contractual commitments are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season. \n (d) These purchase obligations primarily reflect miscellaneous agreements for the purchase of materials and the procurement of services necessary for normal operations. \n (e) Long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits, totaling $11.0, have been excluded from the table above because the timing of future cash outflows, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. Also, commitments related to pension and postretirement benefit plans have been excluded from the table above. The Company expects to contribute $35.5 to its qualified, trusteed pension plans and $0.5 to its non-qualified pension plans during fiscal 2018. With regard to the postretirement benefits, the Company anticipates it will contribute $7.2 to the qualified trusts and $0.2 directly to participants from Spire Missouri funds during fiscal 2018. For further discussion of the Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans, refer to Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements. \nMARKET RISK\nCommodity Price Risk\nGas Utility\nThe Utilities' commodity price risk, which arises from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, is primarily managed through the operation of the Missouri Utilities' PGA clauses and Spire Alabama's GSA rider. The PGA clauses and GSA rider allows the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC and APSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies, as well as gas inventory carrying costs. Spire Missouri is allowed the flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months. Spire Missouri is able to mitigate, to some extent, changes in commodity prices through the use of physical storage supplies and regional supply diversity. The Utilities also have risk management policies that allow for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing its price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. These policies prohibit speculation. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Missouri had active natural gas derivative positions, but Spire Alabama did not. Costs and cost reduction, including carrying costs, associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to customers through the operation of the PGA clauses or GSA rider. Accordingly, the Utilities do not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments. However, the timing of recovery for cash payments related to margin requirements may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. For more information about the Utilities' natural gas derivative instruments, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nGas Marketing\nIn the course of its business, Spire's non-regulated gas marketing subsidiary, Spire Marketing, enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and natural gas index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments. In accordance with the risk management policy, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed price commitments. This risk is currently managed either by closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed-prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to lock in margins. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, Spire Marketing's unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spire's financial position or results of operations.\nAs mentioned above, Spire Marketing uses natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the NYMEX and ICE to manage the commodity price risk associated with its fixed-price natural gas purchase and sale commitments. These derivative instruments may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases or sales. Such accounting treatment, if elected, generally permits a substantial portion of the gain or loss to be deferred from recognition in earnings until the period that the associated forecasted purchase or sale is recognized in earnings. To the extent a hedge is effective, gains or losses on the derivatives will be offset by changes in the value of the hedged forecasted transactions.

These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. To the extent possible, Spire Marketing enters into netting arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate exposure to credit risk. It is also exposed to credit risk associated with its derivative contracts designated as normal purchases and normal sales. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations. For more information on these concentrations of credit risk, including how Spire Marketing manages these risks, see Note 11, Concentrations of Credit Risk, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk associated with its long-term and short-term debt issuances. Based on average short-term borrowings during fiscal 2017, an increase of 100 basis points in the underlying average interest rate for short-term debt would have caused an increase in interest expense of approximately $4.9 on an annual basis. Portions of such increases may be offset through the application of PGA carrying costs. At September 30, 2017, Spire had no variable rate long-term debt outstanding but had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling $2,112.0, which includes $67.0 of fixed-rate long-term debt assumed through the acquisition of Spire EnergySouth. Spire Missouri had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling $980.0 and Spire Alabama had fixed rate long-term debt of $250.0, both included in Spire's total long-term debt. While these long-term debt issues are fixed-rate, they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities' regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemptions of long-term debt would typically be deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and amortized over a future period.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2016, Spire entered into five-year interest rate swap transactions with a fixed interest rate of 1.776% and a notional amount of $105.0 to protect itself against adverse movement in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company entered into seven-year swap transactions with an average fixed interest rate of 1.501% and a notional amount of $120.0 to hedge additional debt expected to be issued in fiscal 2017. All of these hedge positions were settled during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, resulting in a gain of $14.1 which will be amortized over the hedged periods. Also during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Spire entered into a ten-year interest rate swap with a fixed interest rate of 2.658% and a notional amount of $60.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future interest rate payments. The Company recorded a $0.9 mark-to-market loss on this swap for the year ended September 30, 2017. Refer to Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional details on these interest rate swap transactions.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nThe Utilities own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Company's, Spire Missouri's, or Spire Alabama's financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations, and their interpretations change, however, the Utilities may be required to incur additional costs. For information relative to environmental matters, see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAt September 30, 2017, the Company had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements, other than operating leases and letters of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not expect to engage in any significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Dollars in millions, except per share and per unit amounts)\nINTRODUCTION\nThis section analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of Spire Inc. (Spire or the Company), Spire Missouri Inc. (Spire Missouri or the Missouri Utilities), and Spire Alabama Inc. (Spire Alabama). Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama, and Spire EnergySouth Inc. (Spire EnergySouth) are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. Spire Missouri changed its name from Laclede Gas Company on August 30, 2017, and Spire Alabama changed its name from Alabama Gas Corporation on September 1, 2017. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth Inc. (formerly known as EnergySouth, Inc.) are collectively referred to as the Utilities. The subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth are Spire Gulf Inc. (Spire Gulf, formerly known as Mobile Gas Service Corporation) and Spire Mississippi Inc. (Spire Mississippi, formerly known as Willmut Gas & Oil Company). This section includes management's view of factors that affect the respective businesses of the Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama, explanations of financial results including changes in earnings and costs from the prior periods, and the effects of such factors on the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's overall financial condition and liquidity.\nReference is made to Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe Company has two key business segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. Spire's earnings are primarily derived from its Gas Utility segment, which reflects the regulated activities of the Utilities. Due to the seasonal nature of the Utilities' business, earnings of Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are typically concentrated during the heating season of November through April each fiscal year.\nGas Utility - Spire Missouri\nSpire Missouri is Missouri's largest natural gas distribution utility and is regulated by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC). Spire Missouri serves St. Louis and eastern Missouri through Spire Missouri East (formerly Laclede Gas Company) and serves Kansas City and western Missouri through Spire Missouri West (formerly Missouri Gas Energy, or MGE). Spire Missouri delivers natural gas to retail customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the MoPSC. The earnings of Spire Missouri are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. The rate design for each service territory serves to lessen the impact of weather volatility on its customers during cold winters and stabilize Spire Missouri's earnings.\nGas Utility - Spire Alabama\nSpire Alabama is the largest natural gas distribution utility in the state of Alabama. Spire Alabama's service territory is located in central and northern Alabama. Among the cities served by Spire Alabama are Birmingham, the center of the largest metropolitan area in the state, and Montgomery, the state capital. Spire Alabama is regulated by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC). Spire Alabama purchases natural gas through interstate and intrastate suppliers and distributes the purchased gas through its distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and other end-users of natural gas. Spire Alabama also provides transportation services to large industrial and commercial customers located on its distribution system. These transportation customers, using Spire Alabama as their agent or acting on their own, purchase gas directly from marketers or suppliers and arrange for delivery of the gas into the Spire Alabama distribution system. Spire Alabama charges a fee to transport such customer-owned gas through its distribution system to the customers' facilities.\nGas Marketing\nSpire Marketing Inc. (Spire Marketing) is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related activities on a non-regulated basis and is reported in the Gas Marketing segment. Spire Marketing markets natural gas across the country with the core of its footprint located in and around the central United States (US). It holds firm transportation and storage contracts in order to effectively manage its customer base, which consists of producers, pipelines, power generators, storage operators, municipalities, utility companies, and large commercial and industrial customers.\nBusiness Evaluation Factors\nBased on the nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as current economic conditions, management focuses on the following key variables in evaluating the financial condition and results of operations and managing the business.\nGas Utility segment:\n \u2022 the Utilities' ability to recover the costs of purchasing and distributing natural gas from their customers; \n \u2022 the impact of weather and other factors, such as customer conservation, on revenues and expenses; \n \u2022 changes in the regulatory environment at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as decisions by regulators, that impact the Utilities' ability to earn its authorized rate of return in all service territories they serve; \n \u2022 the Utilities' ability to access credit markets and maintain working capital sufficient to meet operating requirements; \n \u2022 the effect of natural gas price volatility on the business; and \n \u2022 the ability to integrate the operations of all acquisitions.  Gas Marketing segment:\n \u2022 the risks of competition; \n \u2022 fluctuations in natural gas prices; \n \u2022 new national infrastructure projects; \n \u2022 the ability to procure firm transportation and storage services at reasonable rates; \n \u2022 credit and/or capital market access; \n \u2022 counterparty risks; and \n \u2022 the effect of natural gas price volatility on the business.  Further information regarding how management seeks to manage these key variables is discussed below.\nGas Utility\nThe Utilities seek to provide reliable natural gas services at a reasonable cost, while maintaining and building secure and dependable infrastructures. The Utilities' strategies focus on improving both performance and the ability to recover their authorized distribution costs and rates of return. The Utilities' distribution costs are the essential, primarily fixed, expenditures it must incur to operate and maintain more than 58,000 miles of mains and services comprising the natural gas distribution systems and related storage facilities for Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth.\nThe Utilities' distribution costs include wages and employee benefit costs, depreciation and maintenance expenses, and other regulated utility operating expenses, excluding natural and propane gas expense. Distribution costs are considered in the rate-making process, and recovery of these types of costs is included in revenues generated through the Utilities' tariff rates. Spire Missouri's tariff rates are approved by the MoPSC, whereas Spire Alabama's tariff rates are approved by the APSC. The subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi, have tariff rates that are approved by the APSC and Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC), respectively. Spire Missouri also has an off-system sales and capacity release income stream that is regulated by tariff.\nSpire Missouri's income from off-system sales and capacity release remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. Spire Missouri is allowed to retain the following portions of annual income (shown by service territory):\n\nSome of the factors impacting the level of off-system sales include the availability and cost of Spire Missouri's natural gas supply, the weather in its service area, and the weather in other markets. When Spire Missouri's service area experiences warmer-than-normal weather while other markets experience colder weather or supply constraints, some of Spire Missouri's natural gas supply is available for off-system sales.\nThe Utilities work actively to reduce the impact of wholesale natural gas price volatility on their costs by strategically structuring their natural gas supply portfolios to increase their gas supply availability and pricing alternatives. They may also use derivative instruments to hedge against significant changes in the commodity price of natural gas. Nevertheless, the overall cost of purchased gas remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. The Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf, and Spire Mississippi and Spire Alabama's Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider allow the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the public service commissions, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including costs, cost reductions, and related carrying costs associated with the use of derivative instruments to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas, as well as gas inventory carrying costs. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Missouri had active derivative positions, but Spire Alabama has had no gas supply derivative instrument activity since 2010. The Utilities believe they will continue to be able to obtain sufficient gas supply. The price of natural gas supplies and other economic conditions may affect sales volumes, due to the conservation efforts of customers, and cash flows associated with the timing of collection of gas costs and related accounts receivable from customers.\nThe Utilities rely on short-term credit and long-term capital markets, as well as cash flows from operations, to satisfy their seasonal cash requirements and fund their capital expenditures. The Utilities' ability to issue commercial paper, access their lines of credit, issue long-term bonds, or obtain new lines of credit is dependent on current conditions in the credit and capital markets. Management focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and believes it currently has adequate access to credit and capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources to meet their foreseeable obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information.\nGas Marketing\nSpire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and providing energy services to both on-system utility transportation customers and customers outside of the Utilities' traditional service areas. Spire Marketing utilizes its natural gas supply agreements, transportation agreements, park and loan agreements, storage agreements, and other executory contracts to support a variety of services to its customers at competitive prices. It closely monitors and manages the natural gas commodity price and volatility risks associated with providing such services to its customers through the use of a variety of risk management activities, including the use of exchange-traded/cleared derivative instruments and other contractual arrangements. Spire Marketing is committed to managing commodity price risk while it seeks to expand the services that it now provides. Nevertheless, income from the Gas Marketing operations is subject to more fluctuations in market conditions than the Utilities' operations.\nThe Gas Marketing business is directly impacted by the effects of competition in the marketplace, the impacts of new infrastructure, surplus natural gas supplies, and the addition of new demand from exports, power generation and industrial load. Spire Marketing's management expects a growing need for marketing services across the country as customers manage seasonal variability and marketplace volatility.\nIn addition to its operating cash flows, Spire Marketing relies on Spire's parental guarantees to secure its purchase and sales obligations of natural gas, and it also has access to Spire's liquidity resources. A large portion of Spire Marketing's receivables are from customers in the energy industry. It also enters into netting arrangements with many of its energy counterparties to reduce overall credit and collateral exposure. Although Spire Marketing's uncollectible amounts are closely monitored and have not been significant, increases in uncollectible amounts from customers are possible and could adversely affect Gas Marketing's liquidity and results of operations.\nSpire Marketing carefully monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its transactions. It performs in-house credit reviews of potential customers and may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit, or parental guarantees when appropriate. Credit limits for customers are established and monitored.\nAs a result of infrastructure optimization activities and an abundance of natural gas supply, Spire Marketing cannot be certain that all of its wholesale purchase and sale transactions will settle physically. As such, certain transactions are designated as trading activities for financial reporting purposes, due to their settlement characteristics. Results of operations from trading activities are reported on a net basis in Gas Marketing operating revenues (or expenses, if negative), which may cause volatility in the Company's operating revenues, but have no effect on operating income or net income.\nIn the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. In accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), some of its purchase and sale transactions are not recognized in earnings until the natural gas is physically delivered, while other energy-related transactions, including those designated as trading activities, are required to be accounted for as derivatives, with the changes in their fair value (representing unrealized gains or losses) recorded in earnings in periods prior to settlement. Because related transactions of a purchase and sale strategy may be accounted for differently, there may be timing differences in the recognition of earnings under GAAP and economic earnings realized upon settlement. The Company reports both GAAP and net economic earnings (non-GAAP), as discussed below.\nOther\nIn addition to the Gas Utility and Gas Marketing segments, other non-utility activities of the Company include:\n \u2022 unallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs; \n \u2022 Spire STL Pipeline, a subsidiary of Spire planning construction and operation of a proposed 65-mile Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulated pipeline to deliver natural gas into eastern Missouri; and \n \u2022 Spire's subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline, compression of natural gas and risk management, among other activities. \nEARNINGS\nNet income reported by Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama is determined in accordance with GAAP. Management also uses the non-GAAP financial measures of net economic earnings, net economic earnings per share and contribution margin when internally evaluating and reporting results of operations. These non-GAAP operating metrics should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, GAAP measures such as net income, earnings per share and operating income. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Net Economic Earnings and Net Economic Earnings Per Share\nNet economic earnings and net economic earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude from net income the after-tax impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions as well as acquisition, divestiture, and restructuring activities. These fair value and timing adjustments are made in instances where the accounting treatment differs from what management considers the economic substance of the underlying transaction, including the following:\n \u2022 Net unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives that are required by GAAP fair value accounting associated with current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. These unrealized gains and losses result primarily from two sources: \n 1) changes in the fair values of physical and/or financial derivatives prior to the period of settlement; and, \n 2) ineffective portions of accounting hedges, required to be recorded in earnings prior to settlement, due to differences in commodity price changes between the locations of the forecasted physical purchase or sale transactions and the locations of the underlying hedge instruments; \n \u2022 Lower of cost or market adjustments to the carrying value of commodity inventories resulting when the market price of the commodity falls below its original cost, to the extent that those commodities are economically hedged; and \n \u2022 Realized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of economic hedges prior to the sale of the physical commodity.  These adjustments eliminate the impact of timing differences and the impact of current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in each period until being replaced with the actual gains or losses realized when the associated physical transactions occur. While management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate both the Utilities and non-utility businesses, the net effect of adjustments on the Utilities' earnings is minimal because gains or losses on their natural gas derivative instruments are deferred pursuant to state regulation.\nManagement believes that excluding the earnings volatility caused by recognizing changes in fair value prior to settlement and other timing differences associated with related purchase and sale transactions provides a useful representation of the economic effects of only the actual settled transactions and their effects on results of operations. In addition, management excludes the impact related to certain acquisition, divestiture, and restructuring activities when evaluating on-going performance, and therefore excludes these impacts from net economic earnings. Similarly, in fiscal years 2016, 2014 and 2013, net economic earnings per share excludes the impact of shares issued in those years to finance acquisitions that closed late in each fiscal year. Management believes that this presentation provides a useful representation of operating performance by facilitating comparisons of year-over-year results. The definition and measurement of net economic earnings provided above is consistent with that used by management and the Board of Directors in assessing the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's performance as well as determining performance under the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's incentive compensation plans. Further, the Company believes this better enables an investor to view the Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's performance in that period on a basis that would be comparable to prior periods.\nReconciliations of net economic earnings and net economic earnings per share to the Company's most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages.\nNon-GAAP Measure - Contribution Margin\nIn addition to operating revenues and operating expenses, management also uses the non-GAAP measure of contribution margin when evaluating results of operations. The Utilities pass to their customers (subject to prudence review by, as applicable, the MoPSC, APSC, or MSPSC) increases and decreases in the wholesale cost of natural gas in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA rider. The volatility of the wholesale natural gas market results in fluctuations from period to period in the recorded levels of, among other items, revenues and natural gas cost expense. Nevertheless, increases and decreases in the cost of gas associated with system gas sales volumes and gross receipts tax expense (which are calculated as a percentage of revenues), with the same amount (excluding immaterial timing differences) included in revenues, has no direct effect on operating income. Contribution margin is defined as operating revenues less natural and propane gas costs and gross receipts tax expense. As these items are reflected in both operating revenue and operating expenses and management has little control over these amounts for the Utilities, management believes that contribution margin is a useful supplemental measure. In addition, it is management's belief that contribution margin and the remaining operating expenses that calculate operating income are useful in assessing the Company's and the Utilities' performance as management has more ability to influence control over these revenues and expenses.\nSpire\nOverview - Net Income (Loss)\n\n * Income tax effect is calculated by applying federal, state, and local income tax rates applicable to ordinary income to the amounts of the pre-tax reconciling items. \n ** Fiscal 2016 net economic earnings per share excludes the impact of the May 2016 equity issuance to fund a portion of the acquisition of Spire EnergySouth. The weighted average diluted shares used in the net economic earnings per share calculation for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 43.5 compared to 44.3 in the GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculation. For fiscal years 2017 and 2015, net economic earnings per share is calculated by replacing consolidated net income with consolidated net economic earnings in the GAAP diluted EPS calculation. \n2017 vs. 2016\nConsolidated\nSpire's net income was $161.6 in fiscal 2017, compared with $144.2 in fiscal 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $3.44 and $3.43, respectively, for fiscal 2017 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $3.26 and $3.24, respectively, for fiscal 2016. Net economic earnings were $167.6 (or $3.56 per share) in fiscal 2017, compared with $149.1 (or $3.42 per share) in fiscal 2016, an increase of $18.5. Net income increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to $21.5 income growth in the Gas Utility segment, partly offset by a $3.7 income decline in the Gas Marketing segment and a $0.4 larger loss from other activities.\nGas Utility\nGas Utility net income and net economic earnings increased by $21.5 and $21.2, respectively, in fiscal 2017, compared to fiscal 2016. The increases to net income and net economic earnings were driven by the $9.6 income growth generated by the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, margin growth and combined lower O&M expenses at Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama. The margin growth was driven by higher Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS) charges at the Missouri Utilities and net favorable regulatory adjustments at Spire Alabama, partly offset by weather impacts resulting from warmer winter temperatures. These impacts were partly offset by increases in depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, interest expense was higher due to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition and higher interest charges experienced by Spire Missouri. Income taxes were also higher due to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition and higher pre-tax income for both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama. Further details are discussed in the Gas Utility, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama sections below.\nGas Marketing\nGas Marketing reported net income totaling $3.4, a decrease of $3.7 compared with the same period last year. Net economic earnings for fiscal 2017 increased $0.4 from fiscal 2016. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to unfavorable mark-to-market (MTM) activity in the current year. Net economic earnings benefited from increased value from spreads and asset optimization in the current year versus the prior year. Further details are discussed in the Gas Marketing section below.\nOther\nThe combined increase in net loss and net economic loss for the Company's other non-utility activities were $0.4 and $3.1, respectively, for fiscal 2017 compared to the same period last year. The increased loss was primarily the result of higher current year interest charges associated with the September 2016 acquisition of Spire EnergySouth.\nOperating Revenues and Operating Expenses\nReconciliations of contribution margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are shown below. \n\n\nConsolidated\nSpire reported operating revenues of $1,740.7 for the year ended September 30, 2017 compared with for $1,537.3 the same period last year. The increase was driven primarily by the Utilities, the result of the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, higher ISRS charges at Spire Missouri, favorable regulatory adjustments at Spire Alabama, and higher gas costs passed on to customers in both Missouri and Alabama. These positive drivers were partly offset by lower demand as a result of warmer weather. Spire's contribution margin increased $88.2 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher contribution margin of $94.6 for the Gas Utility segment, slightly offset by the lower contribution margin reported in Gas Marketing. Operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses increased $26.7 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the same period last year, as discussed below. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $16.6, driven principally by the Spire EnergySouth acquisition and continued infrastructure investment at Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama in fiscal 2017.\nGas Utility\nOperating Revenues - Gas Utility operating revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $208.5 compared to fiscal 2016, and was attributable to the following factors:\n\nContribution Margin - Gas Utility contribution margin was $939.0 for fiscal 2017, a $94.6 increase over the same period last year. The increase was attributable to the following factors:\n\nThe increase was primarily attributable to the $66.6 of operating margin resulting from the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, lower RSE revenue adjustments, beneficial CCM and return on capital impacts totaling $19.2 for Spire Alabama, and benefits of higher ISRS charges for the Missouri Utilities in 2017 of $14.2. These positive impacts offset the negative impact of weather and temperature adjustments. Temperatures in the Spire Missouri territory experienced degree days that were 1% warmer than last year and 20% warmer than normal. Degree days in the Spire Alabama service areas in fiscal 2017 were 15% warmer than the prior year, and 35% warmer than normal. Temperatures are a significant part of the Utilities' rate cases, contributing to the constrained margins experienced in the current year.\nOperating Expenses - Depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $16.6 from the same period last year, $10.0 the result of the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, $4.5 due to Spire Missouri and $2.1 relating to Spire Alabama, principally the result of continued infrastructure capital spending in fiscal 2017. O&M expenses increased $29.8 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $33.5 increase relating to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, O&M expenses were $3.7 below prior year levels due primarily to lower employee-related costs that were only partly offset by higher professional services. The employee labor-costs were favorably impacted by the warmer weather experienced in both the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama service territories. Taxes other than income taxes were $12.6 higher in the current year, with $7.6 of the increase attributable to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition. $4.2 of the increase was related to the higher gross receipt taxes due to the higher revenues, with the remainder of the variance related to property tax expense at Spire Missouri.\nGas Marketing\nOperating Revenues - Gas Marketing operating revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $0.8 from the same period last year. The variance in revenues reflects the impact of higher total volumes and higher commodity pricing levels offset by the effect of increased trading activities, and unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives. Under GAAP, revenues associated with trading activities are presented net of related costs. Average pricing for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 was approximately $2.897/MMBtu versus approximately $2.286/MMBtu for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.611/MMBtu.\nContribution Margin - Gas Marketing contribution margin was $11.6 for fiscal 2017, a $6.1 decrease compared to the same period last year, with that variance significantly impacted by unfavorable fair value adjustments on derivative holdings in the current year, and favorable adjustments in the prior year. Removing these fair value adjustments from both periods, contribution margin is $0.7 higher than last year, reflecting favorable wholesale trading volumes and storage optimization.\nOther\nOther operating revenue increased $2.9 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, driven by higher reinsurance premiums. Other operating expenses were essentially flat with the prior year, as an increase in costs related to the reinsurance premiums was offset by a decrease in corporate-level integration expenses.\nInterest Charges\nConsolidated interest charges during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $11.9 versus the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by the debt incurred and assumed as a result of the Spire EnergySouth acquisition generating interest expense of $8.5, combined with marginally higher interest rates on floating rate debt in the first six months of the year and higher interest rates on the senior notes issued in March of this year that were used to retire the $250.0 of floating rate debt. Also, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, average short-term borrowings were $485.8 and $273.9, respectively, and the average interest rates on these borrowings were 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nConsolidated income tax expense increased $8.1 in fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The current year effective tax rate of 32.4% was essentially flat versus fiscal 2016's effective rate of 32.5%.\nSpire Missouri\nSummary Operating Results\n\nOperating revenues during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $84.4 from the same period last year. Revenues were impacted primarily by higher gas costs of $50.9 passed on to customers, $17.9 higher off- system and capacity release sales, higher ISRS charges of $14.2, and higher gross receipts taxes of $3.3. These impacts were slightly offset by negative weather impacts.\nContribution margin for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $14.8 from the same period last year. Higher ISRS charges of $14.2 were only partly offset by a negative $2.6 weather impact attributable to the 1% warmer weather experienced in the current year.\nO&M for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 were $0.6 lower than the prior year. Lower employment-related costs were almost completely offset by higher professional services. Depreciation and amortization increased $4.5, reflecting continued infrastructure investments throughout Missouri. Interest expense in the current year was $1.7 greater than prior year, the result of a combination of higher short-term borrowings and higher average effective interest rates. Income taxes were $2.1 higher for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 versus the comparable prior year period due to higher pre-tax book income, mitigated by a slightly lower effective tax rate.\nTemperatures experienced in the Missouri Utilities' service area during fiscal 2017 were 1% warmer than the same period last year and 20% warmer than normal. Normal temperatures are part of Spire Missouri's rate case design, meaning the warmer than normal temperatures continued to constrain margins. Total system therms sold and transported were 1,482.1 million for fiscal 2017 compared with 1,479.3 million for fiscal 2016. Total off-system therms sold and transported outside of Spire Missouri's service area were 175.6 million for fiscal 2017 compared with 183.3 million for fiscal 2016.\nSpire Alabama\nSummary Operating Results\n\nOperating revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 increased $32.0 versus the comparable period ended September 30, 2016. Of the increase, $19.2 of the increase related to lower RSE return on equity revenue adjustments and higher CCM benefits in the current year, $11.2 resulted from weather/temperature adjustments, along with slightly higher gross receipts taxes of $1.6.\nContribution margin increased $13.2 versus prior year, as $19.2 in favorable RSE, CCM adjustments and return on capital more than offset negative weather and usage impacts of $6.0. Contributing to the favorable current year RSE return on equity adjustment impact was a fiscal 2016 reduction in revenues relating to a legal settlement of $6.0. There was no impact to net income, as this revenue adjustment offset a corresponding $6.0 gain recorded in other income.\nO&M expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 decreased $3.1 versus the year ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in other operating expenses was driven primarily by lower employee-related costs, which were favorably impacted by the warmer weather in the current year. Depreciation and amortization was $2.1 higher versus the same period last year, the result of continued infrastructure investment throughout Spire Alabama's service territory. Income tax expense increased $3.4, primarily due to the higher pre-tax book income earned in the current year.\nTemperatures in Spire Alabama's service area during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 were 35% warmer than normal and 15% warmer than the same period a year earlier. Spire Alabama's total therms sold and transported were 900.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017, compared with 878.1 million for the same period last year.\nFor further information on the GSA, RSE and CCM mechanisms, please see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 15, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Financial Statements.\n2016 vs. 2015\nSpire\nConsolidated\nSpire's net income was $144.2 in fiscal 2016, compared with $136.9 in fiscal 2015. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $3.26 and $3.24, respectively, for fiscal 2016 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $3.16 for fiscal 2015. Net economic earnings were $149.1 (or $3.42 per share) in fiscal 2016, compared with $138.3 (or $3.19 per share) in fiscal 2015. Net income increased in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to $5.7 income growth in the Gas Utility segment and $3.0 income growth in the Gas Marketing segment, partly offset by a $1.4 larger loss from other activities.\nGas Utility\nGas Utility net income and net economic earnings increased by $5.7 and $9.9, respectively, in fiscal 2016, compared to 2015. The increases to net income and net economic earnings were driven by higher ISRS charges at Spire Missouri and net favorable regulatory adjustments at Spire Alabama, partly offset by lower volumes resulting from warmer winter temperatures. The segment also benefited from a decrease in O&M, which includes effects of the warmer weather. These impacts were partly offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, interest expense was higher due to the increase experienced by Spire Missouri. Income taxes were also higher due to higher pre-tax income for both the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama.\nGas Marketing\nGas Marketing reported net income totaling $7.1 in fiscal 2016, an increase of $3.0 compared to fiscal 2015. Net economic earnings for fiscal 2016 increased $2.2 from fiscal 2015. The increases in net income and net economic earnings were primarily attributable to increases in contribution margin, with the impact to net economic earnings being partly offset by mark-to-market activity as discussed in the Gas Marketing section below.\nOther\nThe combined increase in net loss and net economic loss for the Company's other non-utility activities were $1.4 and $1.3, respectively, for fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of higher interest charges.\nOperating Revenues and Operating Expenses\nReconciliations of the Company's contribution margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are shown above.\nConsolidated\nSpire reported operating revenues of $1,537.3 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared with $1,976.4 for the same prior year period. The decrease was driven primarily by the Utilities, the result of lower volumes and lower gas costs passed on to customers. Spire's contribution margin increased $7.1 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher contribution margin of $5.0 and $2.3 for the Gas Marketing and Gas Utility segments, respectively, slightly offset by the lower contribution margin reported in Other. O&M expenses decreased $9.4 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, as discussed below. The decrease in O&M expenses was partially offset by $6.7 higher depreciation and amortization expense, driven principally by continued infrastructure investment at the Utilities in fiscal 2016.\nGas Utility\nOperating Revenues - Gas Utility Operating Revenues for fiscal 2016 decreased $436.4 compared to fiscal 2015, and was primarily attributable to the following factors:\n\nContribution Margin - Gas Utility contribution margin was $844.4 for fiscal 2016, a $2.3 increase over the same period of fiscal 2015. The increase was attributable to the following factors:\n\nThe increase was primarily attributable to benefits of higher ISRS charges for Spire Missouri in 2016 of $13.8, lower RSE revenue adjustments, beneficial CCM and return on capital impacts totaling $4.5 for Spire Alabama, and $2.2 of contribution margin resulting from the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, which were mostly offset by the negative impact of lower sales volume. A $6.0 gain related to a legal settlement was recorded in other income, but contribution margin was reduced by a revenue adjustment corresponding to the $6.0 gain, resulting in no impact on net income. Temperatures in the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama service areas in fiscal 2016 were 19.7% and 30% warmer than in the same period in the prior year, respectively, significantly contributing to the $18.0 negative volume impact on contribution margin in fiscal 2016.\nOperating Expenses - Depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 increased $7.0 from the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, due principally to continued infrastructure capital spending in fiscal 2016. O&M expenses decreased $8.4 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of a $7.6 gain on the sale of property in 2015, O&M expenses were $16.0 below 2015 levels due primarily to lower bad debt expense (reflecting the impact of warmer weather experienced during the heating season) and employee-related costs.\nGas Marketing\nOperating Revenues - Gas Marketing operating revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $74.9 from the same prior year period. The decrease in revenues reflects the impact of higher total volumes being more than offset by lower commodity pricing levels, the effect of increased trading activities, and favorable mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives. Average pricing for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $2.286/MMBtu versus approximately $3.066/MMBtu for 2015, a $0.781 decline.\nContribution Margin - Gas Marketing contribution margin was $17.7 for fiscal 2016, a $5.0 increase compared to fiscal 2015. Favorable wholesale trading volumes and storage optimization resulted in an $11.7 increase more than offsetting $7.9 of negative pricing impacts. Fair value adjustments accounted for an additional $1.2 favorable impact in fiscal 2016.\nOther\nOperating Revenue and Operating Expenses - Other operating revenue increased $1.1 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in fiscal 2015, reflecting higher insurance revenues. Other O&M expenses were essentially flat with the prior year.\nInterest Charges\nInterest charges during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 increased $2.6 from fiscal 2015. Interest expense reductions from the refinancing of $115.0 in Spire Alabama long-term debt in September and December of 2015, along with lower average short-term borrowings, have been offset by higher rates on short-term borrowings, interest on debt issued to finance the Spire EnergySouth acquisition, interest on acquired debt, and charges related to a temporary bridge facility commitment obtained and terminated during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 related to the Spire EnergySouth acquisition. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, average short-term borrowings were $273.9 and $300.6, respectively, and the average interest rates on those borrowings were 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nConsolidated income tax expense increased $7.3 in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a higher effective tax rate. The fiscal 2016 effective tax rate of 32.5% is approximately 1.3 percentage points higher than the rate for fiscal 2015. The higher fiscal 2016 rate includes tax expense associated with a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our financial statements:\nRegulatory Accounting - The Utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, Regulated Operations.\u201d The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). Management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of these regulatory accounting principles and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. For Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, management believes the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance:\nPGA Clause - Spire Missouri's PGA clauses allows the Missouri Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to a prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including the costs, cost reductions, and related carrying costs associated with the Missouri Utilities' use of natural gas derivative instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas. The difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period. The PGA clauses also permit the application of carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, and also provide for a portion of income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues to be flowed through to customers. Spire Missouri's PGA clauses also authorizes it to recover costs it incurs to finance its investment in gas supplies that are purchased during the storage injection season for sale during the heating season.\nGSA Rider - Spire Alabama's rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider, established in 1993, which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabama's tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA, that is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabama's earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. In prior years, Spire Alabama entered into cash flow derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on its gas supply. Spire Alabama recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Any realized gains or losses are passed through to customers using the mechanisms of the GSA rider in accordance with Spire Alabama's APSC approved tariff and are recognized as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. All derivative commodity instruments in a gain position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to each related counterparty. Derivative commodity instruments in a loss position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to Spire Alabama. Spire Alabama currently has no active gas supply derivative positions.\nGoodwill - Goodwill is measured as the excess of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred over the amount of acquisition-date identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities, and adjustments are recorded during the measurement period to finalize the allocation of purchase price. Spire Missouri has recorded goodwill related to the 2013 acquisition of Spire Missouri West, and Spire also has recorded goodwill related to the 2016 and 2014 acquisitions of Spire EnergySouth and Spire Alabama, respectively. Neither Spire EnergySouth nor Spire Alabama have goodwill on their balance sheets as push down accounting was not applied. Spire and Spire Missouri evaluate goodwill for impairment as of July 1 of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. At July 1, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Spire and Spire Missouri each applied a quantitative goodwill evaluation model to their reporting units and concluded goodwill was not impaired because the fair value exceeded the carrying amounts.\nEmployee Benefits and Postretirement Obligations - Pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions provided by management related to future events, such as discount rates, returns on plan assets, compensation increases, and mortality rates. For the Utilities, the amount of expense recognized and the amounts reflected in other comprehensive income are dependent upon the regulatory treatment provided for such costs, as discussed further below. Certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers' compensation claims, portions of which are self-insured and/or contain stop-loss\u201d coverage with third-party insurers to limit exposure, are established based on historical trends.\nThe amount of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs recognized in the financial statements related to the Utilities' qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based upon allowances, as approved by the MoPSC (for Spire Missouri) and as approved by the APSC (for Spire Alabama). The allowances have been established in the rate-making process for the recovery of these costs from customers. The differences between these amounts and actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs incurred for financial reporting purposes are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. GAAP also requires that changes that affect the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans, but that are not yet required to be recognized as components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs, be reflected in other comprehensive income. For the Utilities' qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, amounts that would otherwise be reflected in other comprehensive income are deferred with entries to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.\nThe tables below reflect the sensitivity of Spire's plans to potential changes in key assumptions:\n\n\n * Excludes the impact of regulatory deferral mechanism. See Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements for information regarding the regulatory treatment of these costs.  For further discussion of significant accounting policies, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nREGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS\nSpire Missouri\nOn September 30, 2016, Spire Missouri filed to increase its ISRS revenues by $5.0 for Spire Missouri East and $3.4 for Spire Missouri West, related to ISRS investments from March 2016 through October 2016. On November 29, 2016, MoPSC staff recommended $4.5 and $3.4 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively, based on updated filings. On January 3, 2017, the MoPSC held a hearing to decide two issues raised by the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel (OPC) pertaining to the ISRS eligibility of hydrostatic testing done by Spire Missouri West and of the replacement of cast iron main interspersed with portions of plastic pipe. On January 18, 2017, the MoPSC found in favor of the Missouri Utilities on the interspersed plastics issue, but against Spire Missouri West on hydrostatic testing, and issued an order setting the ISRS increases at $4.5 and $3.2 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively, bringing total annualized ISRS revenue to $29.5 and $13.4, respectively. Rates were effective January 28, 2017. On March 3, 2017, the OPC filed an appeal to Missouri's Western District Court of Appeals of the MoPSC's decision permitting Spire Missouri to include in the ISRS the replacement of cast iron main interspersed with plastic pipe. The appeal will be heard in November 2017.\nOn February 3, 2017, Spire Missouri filed to increase its ISRS revenues, by $3.3 for Spire Missouri East and $2.9 for Spire Missouri West, related to ISRS investments from November 2016 through February 2017. Following the submission of updated information, on April 4, 2017, MoPSC staff submitted its recommendation for an increase in rates of approximately $3.0 each, for a cumulative total of $32.6 and $16.4 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively. On that same date, the OPC again raised an objection to the ISRS eligibility of replacing cast iron main interspersed with portions of plastic. On April 18, 2017, the parties filed with the MoPSC a unanimous stipulation and agreement proposing to apply the judicial outcome of the OPC's March 3, 2017 appeal on the plastics issue to both the ISRS cases on appeal and the current ISRS cases. The agreement was approved by the MoPSC on April 26, 2017. ISRS rates for each of the two service territories were increased by the MoPSC staff-recommended amounts, effective June 1, 2017.\nOn April 15, 2015, Spire Missouri applied to the MoPSC for a new authorization of long-term financing in the amount of $550.0. On February 10, 2016, the MoPSC issued an order, by a 3-2 vote, authorizing Spire Missouri financing authority of $300.0 for long-term financings placed any time before September 30, 2018. Spire Missouri filed an application for rehearing, which was denied on March 9, 2016. On March 31, 2016, Spire Missouri filed an appeal with Missouri's Western District Court of Appeals concerning this matter. The parties filed briefs and oral arguments were heard on November 17, 2016. On May 30, 2017, Missouri's Western District Court of Appeals issued a decision upholding the MoPSC's February 10, 2016 Order granting Spire Missouri $300.0 in long-term financing authority. On July 5, 2017, the Court denied Spire Missouri's request to transfer the case to the Missouri Supreme Court, and on October 5, 2017, the Missouri Supreme Court declined to hear Spire Missouri's direct appeal. On March 20, 2017, Spire Missouri entered into a bond purchase agreement for $170.0 that was funded on September 15, 2017, and applied against the $300.0 authorization.\nOn April 11, 2017, both Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West filed for a general rate case, and did so concurrently as agreed to in GM-2013-0254, as part of the acquisition of Spire Missouri West by Spire Missouri in fiscal 2013. The request for Spire Missouri East represents a net rate increase of $25.5. With the $32.6 already being billed in ISRS, the total base rate increase request was $58.1. Spire Missouri West's request represents a net rate increase of $34.0. With the $16.4 already being billed in ISRS, the total base rate increase request was $50.4. The rates were premised upon a 10.35% return on equity and the details of the filing can be found in GR-2017-0215 and GR-2017-0216 for Spire Missouri East and Spire Missouri West, respectively. An evidentiary hearing has been set for December 4 through 15, 2017, with a MoPSC decision expected by February 2018. Missouri statutes require new rates to be effective within 11 months of the filing, or by March 8, 2018.\nSpire Alabama\nSpire Alabama is subject to regulation by the APSC which established the RSE rate-setting process in 1983. Spire Alabama's current RSE order has a term extending beyond September 30, 2018, unless the APSC enters an order to the contrary in a manner consistent with law. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, whether physical or economic, of the nature of force majeure and including a change in control, the APSC and Spire Alabama will consult in good faith with respect to modifications, if any. Effective January 1, 2014, Spire Alabama's allowed range of return on average common equity is 10.5% to 10.95% with an adjusting point of 10.8%. Spire Alabama is eligible to receive a performance-based adjustment of 5 basis points to the return on equity adjusting point, based on meeting certain customer satisfaction criteria. Under RSE, the APSC conducts quarterly reviews to determine whether Spire Alabama's return on average common equity at the end of the rate year will be within the allowed range of return. Reductions in rates can be made quarterly to bring the projected return within the allowed range;\nincreases, however, are allowed only once each rate year, effective December 1, and cannot exceed 4% of prior-year revenues. The RSE reduction for the July 31, 2016 quarterly point of test was $4.8 and went into effect October 1, 2016, and for the quarterly point of test at September 30, 2016, Spire Alabama recorded a $2.7 RSE reduction effective December 1, 2016. As part of the annual update for RSE, on November 30, 2016, Spire Alabama filed a reduction for rate year 2017 of $2.5 that also became effective December 1, 2016. There was no RSE reduction for the January 31, 2017, April 30, 2017 and July 31, 2017 points of test. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Alabama recorded a $2.7 RSE reduction to operating revenues to bring the expected rate of return on average common equity at the end of the year to within the allowed range of return.\nThe inflation-based CCM, established by the APSC, allows for annual increases to O&M expense. The CCM range is Spire Alabama's 2007 actual rate year O&M expense inflation-adjusted using the June Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) each rate year plus or minus 1.75% (Index Range). If rate year O&M expense falls within the Index Range, no adjustment is required. If rate year O&M expense exceeds the Index Range, three-quarters of the difference is returned to customers through future rate adjustments. To the extent rate year O&M is less than the Index Range, Spire Alabama benefits by one-half of the difference through future rate adjustments. Certain items that fluctuate based on situations demonstrated to be beyond Spire Alabama's control may be excluded from the CCM calculation. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Alabama recorded a CCM benefit of $10.7 for rate year 2017, which will be reflected in rates effective December 1, 2017. The CCM benefit was $7.8 for rate year 2016 and $4.7 for rate year 2015.\nOn June 28, 2010, the APSC approved a reduction in depreciation rates, effective June 1, 2010, and a regulatory liability recorded for Spire Alabama. Refunds from such negative salvage liability will be passed back to eligible customers on a declining basis through lower tariff rates through rate year 2019 pursuant to the terms of the Negative Salvage Rebalancing (NSR) rider. The total amount refundable to customers is subject to adjustments over the remaining period for charges made to the Enhanced Stability Reserve (ESR) and other APSC-approved charges. The refunds are due to a re-estimation of future removal costs provided for through the prior depreciation rates. For fiscal 2017, approximately $6.3 of the customer refund was returned to customers. As of September 30, 2017, $12.3 is remaining to be refunded to customers. The NSR pass back for fiscal 2018 is $8.2 and will be reflected in rates effective December 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018.\nThe APSC approved an ESR in 1998, which was subsequently modified and expanded in 2010. As currently approved, the ESR provides deferred treatment and recovery for the following: (1) extraordinary O&M expenses related to environmental response costs; (2) extraordinary O&M expenses related to self-insurance costs that exceed $1.0 per occurrence; (3) extraordinary O&M expenses, other than environmental response costs and self-insurance costs, resulting from a single force majeure event or multiple force majeure events greater than $0.3 and $0.4, respectively, during a rate year; and (4) negative individual large commercial and industrial customer budget revenue variances that exceed $0.4 during a rate year. Charges to the ESR are subject to certain limitations which may disallow deferred treatment and which prescribe the timing of recovery. Funding to the ESR is provided as a reduction to the refundable negative salvage balance over its nine-year term beginning December 1, 2010. Subsequent to the nine-year period and subject to APSC authorization, Spire Alabama expects to be able to recover underfunded ESR balances over a five-year amortization period with an annual limitation of $0.7. Amounts in excess of this limitation are deferred for recovery in future years.\nSpire Alabama has APSC approval for an intercompany revolving credit agreement allowing Spire Alabama to borrow from Spire in a principal amount not to exceed $200.0 at any time outstanding in combination with its bank line of credit, and to loan to Spire in a principal amount not to exceed $25.0 at any time outstanding. Borrowings may be used for the following purposes: (a) meeting increased working capital requirements; (b) financing construction requirements related to additions, extensions, and replacements of the distribution systems; and (c) financing other expenditures that may arise from time to time in the normal course of business.\nOn September 18, 2017, Spire Alabama filed an application with the APSC for authorization to issue and sell $75.0 principal amount of debt and to purchase interest rate derivative instruments for the purpose of locking in favorable interest rates and to include the associated interest charges, issuance costs, fees and any gain or loss resulting from the settlement of such interest rate derivative instruments through rates. The application was approved by the APSC October 3, 2017.\nSpire\nIn addition to the matters described above, the following regulatory matters affect Spire.\nSpire Gulf has similar rate regulation to Spire Alabama. The RSE allowed range of return on average common equity is 10.45% to 10.95% with an adjusting point of 10.7%. The CCM has the same return and similar recovery provisions when expenses exceed or are under a band of +/- 1.50% around the CPI-U inflated O&M per customer expense level from September 30, 2017, excluding expenses for pensions and gas bad debt. Additionally, it has a Cast Iron Main Replacement (CIMR) factor that provides an enhanced return on the pro-rata costs associated with cast iron main replacement for miles over 10 miles per year based on a 75% weighting for the equity content. Spire Gulf also has an ESR for negative revenue variances over $o.1 or a force majeure event expense of $0.1 (or two events that exceed $0.15), a Self Insurance Reserve (SIR) for general liability coverage, and an Environmental Cost Recovery Factor (ECRF) as part of its PGA that recovers 90% of prudently incurred costs for compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations. It also has an APSC-approved intercompany revolving credit agreement with Spire to borrow in a principal amount not to exceed $50.0, and to loan up to $25.0.\nOn September 21, 2017, Spire Gulf filed an application to defer certain pension and post-retirement health plan costs. The application was approved by the APSC October 3, 2017.\nSpire Mississippi utilizes a formula rate-making process under the Rate Stabilization Adjustment (RSA) Rider. It is based on a formulaically derived return on equity, and is updated on an annual basis if the equity return on an end of period rate base is beyond the allowed return on equity by 1.0%, with 75% of any shortfall back to the midpoint being put into a rate increase and 50% of any excess back to the midpoint resulting in a rate decrease. Updates are made based on known and measurable adjustments to historic costs from 12-months ended June 30, submitted September 15 for an effective date of November 1, unless disputed by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff, with any disputes to be resolved by the MSPSC by January 15 of the following year. Spire Mississippi had approved December 3, 2015 a Supplemental Growth Rider (SGR) for a 3-year period to provide enhanced returns of a 12.0% return on equity for a period of 10 years on certain system expansion projects.\nIn July 2016, the proposed project of Spire STL Pipeline LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire, was accepted into the pre-filing process at the FERC. The proposal outlined the plan to build, own, operate, and maintain a pipeline interconnecting with the Rockies Express pipeline to deliver natural gas to the St. Louis, Missouri area. As an interstate project, the Spire STL Pipeline is being reviewed for siting and permitting by the FERC, which is the lead agency for other federal, state, and local permitting authorities. In January 2017, Spire submitted an application with the FERC requesting issuance of a certificate of convenience and necessity authorizing it to construct, own, and operate an interstate pipeline. Several parties have filed interventions and comments regarding the Spire STL Pipeline project. The company is monitoring these closely and has responded where appropriate. In April 2017, Spire STL Pipeline filed an amended certificate application to adjust the preferred route to include a new six-mile segment rather than an existing line, offering a number of benefits including eliminating potential supply disruption risk for Spire Missouri during construction, eliminating uncertainty regarding upgrade costs, and reducing long-term integrity management costs. In its Environmental Assessment issued on September 29, 2017, the FERC concluded that approval of the Spire STL Pipeline, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Spire anticipates the FERC will deliver a Final Order by the end of calendar year 2017.\nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThe Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have evaluated or are in the process of evaluating the impact that recently issued accounting standards will have on their financial position or results of operations upon adoption. For disclosures related to the adoption of new accounting standards, see the New Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nINFLATION\nThe accompanying financial statements reflect the historical costs of events and transactions, regardless of the purchasing power of the dollar at the time. Due to the capital-intensive nature of the businesses of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, the most significant impact of inflation is on the depreciation of utility plant. Rate regulation, to which the Utilities are subject, allows recovery through its rates of only the historical cost of utility plant as depreciation. The Utilities expect to incur significant capital expenditures in future years, primarily related to the planned increased replacements of distribution plant. The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama believe that any higher costs experienced upon replacement of existing facilities will be recovered through the normal regulatory process.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nCASH FLOWS\nThe Company's short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when the Utilities borrow money to cover the lag between when they purchase natural gas and when their customers pay for that gas. Changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas (including cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri's use of natural gas derivative instruments), variations in the timing of collections of gas cost under the Utilities' PGA clauses and GSA riders, the seasonality of accounts receivable balances, and the utilization of storage gas inventories cause short-term cash requirements to vary during the year and from year to year, and may cause significant variations in the Company's cash provided by or used in operating activities.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $39.9 from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The change is primarily due to fluctuations in working capital, as mentioned above, largely driven by the relative weather conditions and gas prices during the periods. Cash was provided by increases in accounts payable, net income, depreciation, and deferred income taxes. These benefits were more than offset by a net decrease in advance customer billings and net increases in accounts receivable and natural gas inventory values.\nThe Company used $179.2 less cash in investing activities in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016 but $134.8 more than in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 included $317.7 net cash used for the acquisition of Spire EnergySouth, while fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2015 included only smaller acquisition settlements. Capital expenditures increased $144.8 from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the higher level of infrastructure upgrades across both Missouri and Alabama, as well as $16.0 from the addition of EnergySouth and $25.5 for the Spire STL Pipeline project. Spire estimates its capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 will be approximately $485.0, including approximately $415.0 for the Utilities. The increase in investment reflects the continued commitment to infrastructure upgrades at the Utilities and the beginning of the construction phase of the Spire STL Pipeline.\nCash provided by financing activities was $128.5 lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016. This change primarily reflects the effect of a $26.2 net issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017 compared with a $165.0 net issuance the previous year, while short-term borrowings continued to increase, reflecting the Company's growing operations. Stock issuances in fiscal 2017, which included the conversion of equity units issued in 2014, provided $9.7 more cash than last year, which included the offering to help fund the Spire EnergySouth acquisition. These net cash inflows were partially offset by continued increases in dividend payments and other financing activities this year. In fiscal 2015, the net issuances of long-term debt and common stock were not significant. In the first half of fiscal 2018, Spire Alabama plans to issue long-term notes totaling $75.0. Spire Missouri expects to refinance $100.0 of bonds due in August 2018.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nBank deposits were used to support working capital needs of the business. Spire had no temporary cash investments as of September 30, 2017 or 2016. Due to lower yields available to Spire on short-term investments, the Company elected to provide a portion of Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's short-term funding through intercompany lending during the past fiscal year.\nShort-term Debt\nThe Utilities' short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during the colder months, while the Company's needs are less seasonal. These short-term cash requirements can be met through the sale of commercial paper or through the use of a revolving credit facility.\nOn December 14, 2016, Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama entered into a new syndicated revolving credit facility pursuant to a loan agreement with 11 banks, expiring December 14, 2021. The largest portion provided by a single bank under the line is 12.3%. The loan agreement replaced Spire's and Spire Missouri's existing loan agreements dated as of September 3, 2013 and amended September 3, 2014, which were set to expire on September 3, 2019, and Spire Alabama's existing loan agreement dated September 2, 2014, which was set to expire September 2, 2019. All three previous agreements were terminated on December 14, 2016.\nThe loan agreement has an aggregate credit commitment of $975.0, including sublimits of $300.0 for Spire, $475.0 for Spire Missouri, and $200.0 for Spire Alabama. These sublimits may be reallocated from time to time among the three borrowers within the $975.0 aggregate commitment. Spire may use its line to provide for the funding needs of various subsidiaries. Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama expect to use the loan agreement for general corporate purposes, including short-term borrowings and letters of credit. The agreement also contains financial covenants limiting each borrower's consolidated total debt, including short-term debt, to no more than 70% of its total capitalization. As defined in the line of credit, on September 30, 2017, total debt was 56% of total capitalization for the consolidated Company, 50% for Spire Missouri, and 33% for Spire Alabama. There were no borrowings against this credit facility as of September 30, 2017.\nOn December 21, 2016, Spire established a commercial paper program (Program) pursuant to which Spire may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (Notes). Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $975.0. The Notes may have maturities of up to 365 days from date of issue. The net proceeds of the issuances of the Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including to provide working capital for both utility and non-utility subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2017, Notes outstanding under the Program totaled $477.3.\nInformation about Spire's consolidated short-term borrowings is presented in the following table. Based on average short-term borrowings for the year ended September 30, 2017, an increase in the average interest rate of 100 basis points would decrease Spire's pre-tax earnings and cash flows by approximately $4.9 on an annual basis, portions of which may be offset through the application of PGA or GSA carrying costs.\n\n 1 Spire Short-term Borrowings includes bank line borrowings of Spire Inc. (excluding its subsidiaries) and, since January 1, 2017, commercial paper. Of Spire's $477.3 borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2017, $440.0 was used to provide funding to its subsidiaries, including Spire Missouri ($203.0), Spire Alabama ($169.9), Spire EnergySouth and subsidiaries ($12.9), Spire STL Pipeline LLC ($26.6), and others ($27.6).  2 The commercial paper program for Spire Missouri terminated February 2, 2017.\nLong-term Debt and Equity\nAt September 30, 2017, including the current portion but excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, Spire had long-term debt totaling $2,112.0, of which $980.0 was issued by Spire Missouri, $250.0 was issued by Spire Alabama, and $67.0 was issued by other subsidiaries. All long-term debt bears fixed rates and is subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases and decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities' regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemption of long-term debt typically would be deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities and amortized over a future period.\nOf the Company's $2,112.0 long-term debt (including the current portion), $25.0 has no call options, $1,037.0 has make-whole call options, $5.0 is callable currently, and $1,045.0 is callable at par one to six months prior to maturity.\nMaturities of long-term debt for Spire on a consolidated basis, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama for the five fiscal years subsequent to September 30, 2017 are as follows:\n\nSpire's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's short-term credit facilities and long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants and default provisions. As of September 30, 2017, there were no events of default under these covenants.\nThe Company's, Spire Missouri's and Spire Alabama's access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs, may depend on the credit rating of the entity that is accessing the capital markets. The credit ratings of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama remain at investment grade, but are subject to review and change by the rating agencies.\nIt is management's view that the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have adequate access to capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources, both internal and external, to meet anticipated capital requirements, which primarily include capital expenditures, interest payments on long-term debt, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, short-term seasonal needs, and dividends.\nOn March 10, 2017, Spire redeemed in full at par its $250.0 floating rate notes due August 15, 2017, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn March 15, 2017, Spire completed the issuance and sale of $100.0 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 15, 2027. The notes bear interest at the rate of 3.93% per annum, payable semi-annually. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the notes for the repayment of other debt.\nIn 2014, Spire issued 2.875 million equity units as a portion of the Spire Alabama acquisition financing. The equity units were originally issued at $50 per unit pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (Purchase Contract) dated as of June 11, 2014 between Spire and U.S. Bank National Association, as purchase contract agent, collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary. These units consisted of $143.8 aggregate principal amount of 2014 Series A 2.00% remarketable junior subordinated notes due 2022 (the Junior Notes) and the Purchase Contract obligating the holder to purchase common shares at a future settlement date (anticipated to be three years in the future and prior to the Junior Notes maturity).\nThe equity unit investments were effectively replaced as planned in a series of transactions outlined below:\n \u2022 On February 22, 2017, the selling securityholders (as defined below) agreed to purchase the Junior Notes in connection with the remarketing of the junior subordinated notes that comprised a component of the equity units. \n \u2022 On the same day, Spire entered two related agreements: (1) a Securities Purchase and Registration Rights Agreement (the SPRRA), among Spire and the several purchasers named therein (the selling securityholders), obligating the selling securityholders to sell the Junior Notes to Spire in exchange for $143.8 aggregate principal amount of Spire's 3.543% Senior Notes due 2024 (the Senior Notes) and a cash payment, and (2) an underwriting agreement with the selling securityholders and the several underwriters named therein in connection with the public offering of $150.0 aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes consisting of $6.2 principal amount of the Senior Notes issued and sold by Spire and $143.8 principal amount of the Senior Notes sold by the selling securityholders. The SPRRA granted the selling securityholders the right to offer the Senior Notes to the public in secondary public offerings. \n \u2022 The public offering was completed on February 27, 2017. Spire used its net proceeds from its sale of the Senior Notes to repay short-term debt. Spire did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes by the selling securityholders. \n \u2022 On April 3, 2017, Spire settled the Purchase Contracts underlying its 2.875 million equity units by issuing 2,504,684 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $57.3921 per share. Fractional shares were settled in cash at $67.50 per share. The purchase price was funded with the proceeds of the Junior Notes. Under the contract term, the equity units were converted to common stock at the rate of 0.8712, with a corresponding adjustment to purchase price. Spire received net cash proceeds of approximately $142.0, which it used to repay short-term debt incurred the previous month to redeem the floating rate notes.  On September 15, 2017, Spire Missouri issued and sold in a private placement $50.0 in aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due September 15, 2032, $70.0 in aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due September 15, 2047 and $50.0 in aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due September 15, 2057. Spire Missouri used the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. The 2032 bonds, 2047 bonds and 2057 bonds bear interest at a rate per annum of 3.68%, 4.23% and 4.38%, respectively, payable semi-annually on the 15th day of March and September of each year.\nSpire Missouri has authority from the MoPSC to issue debt securities and preferred stock, including on a private placement basis, as well as to issue common stock, receive paid-in-capital, and enter into capital lease agreements, all for a total of up to $300.0 for financings placed any time before September 30, 2018. During the year ended September 30, 2017, Spire Missouri issued $170.0 in securities under this authorization, so as of that date, $130.0 remains available to be issued.\nSpire has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the issuance and sale of up to 250,000 shares of common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan. There were 244,130 and 239,945 at September 30, 2017 and November 10, 2017, respectively, remaining available for issuance under this Form S-3. Spire also has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of equity and debt securities. Spire Missouri has a shelf registration on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for issuance of first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt, and preferred stock, which expires on September 22, 2019.\nIncluding the current portion of long-term debt, the Company's capitalization at September 30, 2017 consisted of 48.7% of common stock equity and 51.3% long-term debt, compared to 46.1% of common stock equity and 53.9% of long-term debt at September 30, 2016.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAs of September 30, 2017, Spire had contractual obligations with payments due as summarized below:\n\n (a) Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt. Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate and outstanding principal for each instrument with the terms ending at each instrument's stated maturity. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Financial Statements. \n (b) Lease obligations are primarily for office space, vehicles, and power operated equipment. Additional payments will be incurred if renewal options are exercised under the provisions of certain agreements. \n (c) These purchase obligations represent the minimum payments required under existing natural gas transportation and storage contracts and natural gas supply agreements in the Gas Utility and Gas Marketing segments. These amounts reflect fixed obligations as well as obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using September 30, 2017 forward market prices. Each of the Utilities generally recovers costs related to its purchases, transportation, and storage of natural gas through the operation of its PGA clause or GSA rider, subject to prudence review by the appropriate regional public service commission. Variations in the timing of collections of gas costs from customers may affect short-term cash requirements. Additional contractual commitments are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season. \n (d) These purchase obligations primarily reflect miscellaneous agreements for the purchase of materials and the procurement of services necessary for normal operations. \n (e) Long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits, totaling $11.0, have been excluded from the table above because the timing of future cash outflows, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. Also, commitments related to pension and postretirement benefit plans have been excluded from the table above. The Company expects to contribute $35.5 to its qualified, trusteed pension plans and $0.5 to its non-qualified pension plans during fiscal 2018. With regard to the postretirement benefits, the Company anticipates it will contribute $7.2 to the qualified trusts and $0.2 directly to participants from Spire Missouri funds during fiscal 2018. For further discussion of the Company's pension and postretirement benefit plans, refer to Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements. \nMARKET RISK\nCommodity Price Risk\nGas Utility\nThe Utilities' commodity price risk, which arises from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, is primarily managed through the operation of the Missouri Utilities' PGA clauses and Spire Alabama's GSA rider. The PGA clauses and GSA rider allows the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC and APSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies, as well as gas inventory carrying costs. Spire Missouri is allowed the flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months. Spire Missouri is able to mitigate, to some extent, changes in commodity prices through the use of physical storage supplies and regional supply diversity. The Utilities also have risk management policies that allow for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing its price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. These policies prohibit speculation. As of September 30, 2017, Spire Missouri had active natural gas derivative positions, but Spire Alabama did not. Costs and cost reduction, including carrying costs, associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to customers through the operation of the PGA clauses or GSA rider. Accordingly, the Utilities do not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments. However, the timing of recovery for cash payments related to margin requirements may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. For more information about the Utilities' natural gas derivative instruments, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nGas Marketing\nIn the course of its business, Spire's non-regulated gas marketing subsidiary, Spire Marketing, enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and natural gas index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments. In accordance with the risk management policy, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed price commitments. This risk is currently managed either by closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed-prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to lock in margins. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, Spire Marketing's unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spire's financial position or results of operations.\nAs mentioned above, Spire Marketing uses natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the NYMEX and ICE to manage the commodity price risk associated with its fixed-price natural gas purchase and sale commitments. These derivative instruments may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases or sales. Such accounting treatment, if elected, generally permits a substantial portion of the gain or loss to be deferred from recognition in earnings until the period that the associated forecasted purchase or sale is recognized in earnings. To the extent a hedge is effective, gains or losses on the derivatives will be offset by changes in the value of the hedged forecasted transactions. Information about the fair values of Spire Marketing's exchange-traded/cleared natural gas derivative instruments is presented below:\n\n\nCertain of Spire Marketing's physical natural gas derivative contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales, as permitted by GAAP. This election permits the Company to account for the contract in the period the natural gas is delivered. Contracts not designated as normal purchases or normal sales, including those designated as trading activities, are accounted for as derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the periods prior to settlement.\nBelow is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for physical natural gas contracts accounted for as derivatives, none of which will settle beyond fiscal 2020:\n\nFor further details related to Spire Marketing's derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nSpire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with energy producers, utility companies, and pipelines. These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. To the extent possible, Spire Marketing enters into netting arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate exposure to credit risk. It is also exposed to credit risk associated with its derivative contracts designated as normal purchases and normal sales. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations. For more information on these concentrations of credit risk, including how Spire Marketing manages these risks, see Note 11, Concentrations of Credit Risk, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk associated with its long-term and short-term debt issuances. Based on average short-term borrowings during fiscal 2017, an increase of 100 basis points in the underlying average interest rate for short-term debt would have caused an increase in interest expense of approximately $4.9 on an annual basis. Portions of such increases may be offset through the application of PGA carrying costs. At September 30, 2017, Spire had no variable rate long-term debt outstanding but had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling $2,112.0, which includes $67.0 of fixed-rate long-term debt assumed through the acquisition of Spire EnergySouth. Spire Missouri had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling $980.0 and Spire Alabama had fixed rate long-term debt of $250.0, both included in Spire's total long-term debt. While these long-term debt issues are fixed-rate, they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities' regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemptions of long-term debt would typically be deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and amortized over a future period.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2016, Spire entered into five-year interest rate swap transactions with a fixed interest rate of 1.776% and a notional amount of $105.0 to protect itself against adverse movement in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company entered into seven-year swap transactions with an average fixed interest rate of 1.501% and a notional amount of $120.0 to hedge additional debt expected to be issued in fiscal 2017. All of these hedge positions were settled during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, resulting in a gain of $14.1 which will be amortized over the hedged periods. Also during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Spire entered into a ten-year interest rate swap with a fixed interest rate of 2.658% and a notional amount of $60.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future interest rate payments. The Company recorded a $0.9 mark-to-market loss on this swap for the year ended September 30, 2017. Refer to Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional details on these interest rate swap transactions.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nThe Utilities own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Company's, Spire Missouri's, or Spire Alabama's financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations, and their interpretations change, however, the Utilities may be required to incur additional costs. For information relative to environmental matters, see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAt September 30, 2017, the Company had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements, other than operating leases and letters of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business.

Condition and Results of Operations provides a detailed examination of Spire Inc.'s finances, including its subsidiaries, Spire Missouri Inc. and Spire Alabama Inc. The report covers Spire's two main business segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing.\n\nIn the Gas Utility segment, Spire's earnings mainly come from the regulated activities of its utility subsidiaries\u2014operating chiefly during the heating season (November through April).
