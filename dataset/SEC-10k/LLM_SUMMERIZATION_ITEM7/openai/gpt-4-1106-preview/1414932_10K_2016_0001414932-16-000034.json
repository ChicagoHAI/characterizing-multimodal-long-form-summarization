We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code, for tax purposes.\nWe generally lend to and invest in small and mid-sized companies, primarily in connection with investments by private equity sponsors. We define small and mid-sized companies as those with annual EBITDA between $10 million and $120 million. Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio's total return by generating current income from our debt investments, and to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from our equity investments.\nWe are externally managed by the Investment Adviser, a subsidiary of FSAM, a publicly traded alternative asset manager, pursuant to an investment advisory agreement. FSC CT, a subsidiary of the Investment Adviser, also provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for the fair presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements have been made. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We are an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies, or ASC 946.\nInvestment Valuation\nWe are required to report our investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The fair value is deemed to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nWe value our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.\nHierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. Generally, it is expected that all of our investment securities will be valued using Level 3 inputs. This includes investment securities that are valued using \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments are generally classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions.\nFinancial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, our Investment Adviser's capital markets group obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by independent pricing services for all of our senior secured debt investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing services use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations.\nOur Investment Adviser evaluates the prices obtained from independent pricing services based on available market information and company specific data that could affect the credit quality and/or fair value of the investment. Investments for which market quotations are readily available may be valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, our Investment Adviser looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Our Investment Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe any such market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. Examples of these events could include cases when a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale or in the event of a \"fire sale\" by a distressed seller. In these instances, we value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available (as discussed below).\nIf the quotation provided by the pricing service is based on only one or two market sources, we perform additional procedures to corroborate such information, which may include the bond yield approach discussed below and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit quality and market trends affecting the portfolio company.\nWe perform detailed valuations of our debt and equity investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are deemed not to represent fair value of the investments. We typically use two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value, or EV, of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA. EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. We may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is typically performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other alternative methods such as an asset liquidation model, expected recovery model or a recent observable or pending transaction may be utilized to estimate EV. The second valuation technique is a bond yield approach, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. To determine fair value using a bond yield approach, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the bond yield approach, we consider the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, we depend on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.\nWe estimate the fair value of privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions including, but not limited to, the current stock price (by analyzing the portfolio company's operating performance and financial condition and general market conditions), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nOur Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by our Investment Adviser's valuation team in conjunction with the Investment Adviser's portfolio management and capital markets teams;\n</td> </tr>\n</table> \u2022Preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with principals of our Investment Adviser;\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Separately, independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors prepare valuations of our investments, on a selected basis, for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment, and submit the reports to us and provide such reports to our Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Investment Adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuations with the portfolio managers of the Investment Adviser and our Investment Adviser responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between our Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors makes a recommendation to our Board of Directors regarding the fair value of the investments in our portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available in good faith.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The fair value of our investments at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has authorized the engagement of independent valuation firms to provide valuation assistance. We will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter. As of September 30, 2016, 89.8% of our portfolio at fair value was valued by independent valuation firms. The percentage of our portfolio valued by independent valuation firms may vary from period to period based on the\navailability of market quotations for our portfolio investments during the respective periods. However, our Board of Directors is ultimately and solely responsible for the valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nThe percentages of our portfolio, at fair value, valued by independent valuation firms as of the end of each period during the current and two preceding fiscal years were as follows:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, approximately 92.0% and 92.9%, respectively, of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies valued at prices equal to fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest income, adjusted for accretion of original issue discount, or OID, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. In connection with our investment, we sometimes receive nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the particular portfolio company. When we receive nominal cost equity, we allocate our cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. Distributions of income from portfolio companies are generally recorded as dividend income on the ex-dividend date.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were five investments on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.\nFee Income\nWe receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of business, including servicing, advisory, amendment, structuring and prepayment fees, which are classified as fee income and recognized as they are earned.\nWe have also structured exit fees across certain of our portfolio investments to be received upon the future exit of those investments. Exit fees are payable upon the exit of a debt security. These fees are to be paid to us upon the sooner to occur of (i) a sale of the borrower or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, (ii) the maturity date of the loan or (iii) the date when full prepayment of the loan occurs. The receipt of such fees is contingent upon the occurrence of one of the events listed above for each of the investments. A percentage of these fees is included in net investment income over the life of the loan. As of September 30, 2016, we had structured $2.8 million in aggregate exit fees across three portfolio investments upon the future exit of those investments.\nPIK Interest\nOur loans may contain contractual PIK interest provisions. The PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We generally cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. Our decision to cease accruing PIK interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; our assessment of the portfolio company's business development success, including product development, profitability and the portfolio company's overall adherence to its\nbusiness plan; information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. Based on this and other information, we determine whether to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security when it is determined that PIK interest is no longer collectible. Our determination to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security is generally made well before our full write-down of such loan or debt security. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements and, as a result, increases the cost basis of these investments for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser.\nFor a discussion of risks we are subject to as a result of our use of PIK interest in connection with our investments, see \"Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure - We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we are required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes before or without receiving cash representing such income,\" \"- We may in the future choose to pay distributions partly in our own stock, in which case you may be subject to tax in excess of the cash you receive\" and \"- Our incentive fee may induce our Investment Adviser to make speculative investments\" in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments both in our Consolidated Financial Statements and for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser.\nTo maintain our status as a RIC, PIK income must be paid out to our stockholders as distributions, even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never collect the cash relating to the PIK interest. Accumulated PIK interest was $62.6 million, or 2.9%, of the fair value of our portfolio of investments as of September 30, 2016 and $50.7 million, or 2.1%, as of September 30, 2015. The net increases in loan balances as a result of contractual PIK arrangements are separately identified in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nPortfolio Composition\nOur investments principally consist of loans, purchased equity investments and equity grants in privately-held companies and SLF JV I. Our loans are typically secured by a first, second or subordinated lien on the assets of the portfolio company and generally have terms of up to seven years (but an expected average life of between three and four years). We are currently focusing our origination efforts on a prudent mix of senior secured and subordinated loans which we believe will provide attractive risk-adjusted returns while maintaining adequate credit protection. The mix may change over time based on market conditions and management's view of where the best risk- adjusted returns are available.\nA summary of the composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total investments is shown in the following tables:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

employ a ranking system to assess and monitor the credit risk of our investment portfolio. We rank all investments on a scale from 1 to 4. The system is intended to reflect the performance of the borrower's business, the collateral coverage of the loan, and other factors considered relevant to making a credit judgment. We have determined that there should be an individual ranking assigned to each tranche of securities in the same portfolio company where appropriate. This may arise when the perceived risk of loss on the investment varies significantly between tranches due to their respective seniority in the capital structure.\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investment Ranking 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations and/or capital gains are expected.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investment Ranking 2 is used for investments that are performing substantially within our expectations, and whose risks\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nremain materially consistent with the potential risks at the time of the original or restructured investment.

As of September 30, 2016, we had modified the payment terms of our investments in 16 portfolio companies. Such modified terms may include increased PIK interest provisions and reduced cash interest rates.

On July 1, 2014, SLF JV I began investing in senior secured loans of middle market companies and other corporate debt securities. We co-invest in these securities with Kemper through our investment in SLF JV I. SLF JV I is managed by a four person board of directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by Kemper. SLF JV I is capitalized pro rata with subordinated notes and LLC equity interests as transactions are completed. The subordinated notes mature on May 2, 2021. All portfolio decisions and investment decisions in respect of SLF JV I must be approved by the SLF JV I investment committee, which consists of one representative from us and one representative of Kemper (with approval from a representative of each required). As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we and Kemper owned, in the aggregate, 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of each of the outstanding subordinated notes and LLC equity interests.\nSLF JV I has a $200.0 million Deutsche Bank facility with a maturity date of July 1, 2019. Borrowings under the Deutsche Bank facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum. $100.0 million and $188.6 million was outstanding under this facility as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.\nSLF JV I also has a $200.0 million Credit Suisse facility, bringing SLF JV I's total debt capacity to $400.0 million. The Credit Suisse facility has a maturity date of July 7, 2023 and borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum. $67.0 million and $53.0 million was outstanding under this facility as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.\nBorrowings under the Deutsche Bank facility and Credit Suisse facility are secured by all of the assets of the respective special purpose financing vehicles of SLF JV I.\nWe have determined that SLF JV I is an investment company under ASC 946, however, in accordance with such guidance, we will generally not consolidate our investment in a company other than a wholly-owned investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to us. Accordingly, we do not consolidate our noncontrolling interest in SLF JV I.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, SLF JV I had total assets of $338.5 million and $419.0 million, respectively. Our investment in SLF JV I consisted of LLC equity interests of $13.7 million and subordinated notes of $129.0 million, at fair value as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2015, our investment consisted of LLC equity interests of $12.2 million and subordinated notes of $128.9 million, at fair value. The subordinated notes are junior in right of payment to the repayment of temporary contributions made by us to fund investments of SLF JV I that are repaid when Kemper makes its capital contributions. SLF JV I's portfolio consisted of middle market and other corporate debt securities of 37 and 34 \"eligible portfolio companies\" (as defined in the Section 2(a)(46) of the 1940 Act) as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The portfolio companies in SLF JV I are in industries similar to those in which we may invest directly.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, SLF JV I had total capital commitments of $200.0 million, $175.0 million of which was from us and the remaining $25.0 million from Kemper. Approximately $183.9 million and $164.9 million was funded as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, relating to these commitments, of which $160.9 million and $144.3 million, respectively, was from us. As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we had commitments to fund subordinated notes to SLF JV I of $157.5 million, of which $12.7 million and $27.6 million was unfunded, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we had commitments to fund LLC equity interests in SLF JV I of $17.5 million, of which $1.4 million and $3.1 million was unfunded, respectively.\nBelow is a summary of SLF JV I's portfolio, followed by a listing of the individual loans in SLF JV I's portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured loans (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$324,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$395,193\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate on senior secured loans (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.84%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.99%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of borrowers in SLF JV I\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Largest exposure to a single borrower (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$19,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$30,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total of five largest loan exposures to borrowers (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$93,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$109,959\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n(1) At principal amount.\n(2) Computed using the annual interest rate on accruing senior secured loans.\nSLF JV I Portfolio as of September 30, 2016\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Company (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Industry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Interest Rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AccentCare, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Healthcare services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First Lien\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9/3/2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR+5.75% (1% floor)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AdVenture Interactive, Corp.

However, the determination of such fair value is not included in our Board of Directors' valuation process described elsewhere herein.\n(3) This investment was held by both us and SLF JV I at September 30, 2015.\n(4) The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for all floating rate loans is indexed to LIBOR and an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. For each of these loans, we have provided the applicable margin over LIBOR based on each respective credit agreement.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of the subordinated notes held by us was $144.8 million and $129.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016 and $129.9 million and $128.9 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2015. The subordinated notes bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 8.0% per annum, and we earned interest income of $12.0 million and $6.9 million on our investments in these notes for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The cost and fair value of the LLC equity interests held by us was $16.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016, and $14.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2015. We earned dividend income of $5.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively, for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 with respect to our LLC equity interests. The LLC equity interests are dividend producing to the extent SLF JV I has residual income to be distributed on a quarterly basis. The total investment income earned on SLF JV I represented a 11.3% and 15.4% weighted average annualized return on our total investment as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.\nBelow is certain summarized financial information for SLF JV I as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 and for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Balance Sheet Information:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in loans at fair value (cost September 30, 2016: $327,720; cost September 30, 2015: $392,978)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>315,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables from secured financing arrangements at fair value (cost September 30, 2016: $10,014; cost September 30, 2015: $10,021)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>338,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior credit facilities payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>241,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payables from unsettled transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes payable at fair value (proceeds September 30, 2016: $165,533 and September 30, 2015: $148,433)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>405,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Members' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities and members' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>338,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended September 30, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Statements of Operations Information:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,251\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,771\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n(1) There are no management fees or incentive fees charged at SLF JV I.\nSLF JV I has elected to fair value the subordinated notes issued to us and Kemper under ASC 825 - Financial Instruments, or ASC 825. The subordinated notes are valued by calculating the net present value of the future expected cash flow streams using an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate model.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, we sold $99.4 million of senior secured debt investments at fair value to SLF JV I in exchange for $92.8 million cash consideration, $5.9 million of subordinated notes and $0.7 million of LLC equity interests in SLF JV I. We recognized a $0.9 million realized loss on these transactions.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2015, we sold $310.4 million of senior secured debt investments to SLF JV I at fair value in exchange for $256.1 million cash consideration, $48.9 million of subordinated notes and $5.4 million of LLC equity interests in SLF JV I. We recognized a $0.5 million realized loss on these transactions.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results and Operations\nOut-of-Period Adjustments\nWe previously identified accounting errors from fiscal years ended 2012 through 2015 related to revenue recognition and consolidation. The revenue recognition errors were the result of certain fees which were historically recognized on the deal closing date, but should have been amortized over the life of the loan since the fees did not represent a separately identifiable revenue contract. These errors were partially offset by the overpayment of Part I Incentive Fees paid to the Investment Adviser. There were also errors resulting from not historically consolidating wholly-owned holding companies that should have been consolidated (First Star holding companies). We assessed the materiality of the errors on our prior quarterly and annual financial statements, assessing materiality both quantitatively and qualitatively, in accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 99 and SAB 108 and concluded that the errors were not material to any of the previously issued financial statements. However, we recorded a cumulative out-of-period adjustment for the three months ended December 31, 2014 to correct these errors prior to October 1, 2014. These errors did not impact the financial information for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the out-of-period adjustment.\nResults of Operations\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees, and other investment income and total expenses. Net realized gain (loss) on investments and secured borrowings is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and secured borrowings and their stated costs. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio and secured borrowings during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation (depreciation) when gains or losses are realized.\nComparison of Years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015\nTotal Investment Income\nTotal investment income includes interest on our investments, fee income and other investment income. Fee income consists of the monthly servicing fees, advisory fees, structuring fees, exit fees and prepayment fees that we receive in connection with our debt investments. These fees are recognized as earned. Other investment income consists primarily of dividend income received from certain of our equity investments.\nTotal investment income for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $247.9 million and $265.5 million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2016, this amount primarily consisted of $211.2 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $14.0 million of PIK interest) and $22.7 million of fee income. For the year ended September 30, 2015, this amount primarily consisted of $229.3 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $13.4 million of PIK interest) and $22.3 million of fee income.\nTotal investment income for the year ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2015, decreased primarily due to lower interest income from a decrease in the size of our investment portfolio and additional investments on which we stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.\nExpenses\nNet expenses (expenses net of base management fee waivers and insurance recoveries) for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $141.1 million and $150.5 million, respectively. Net expenses decreased for the years ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the years ended September 30, 2015, by $9.4 million, or 6.2%, due primarily to a $9.9 million decrease in base management fees, which was attributable to the permanent fee reduction that we agreed to with our investment adviser effective January 1, 2016, a $6.5 million decrease in Part I incentive fees, which was attributable to lower pre-incentive fee net investment income for the year-over-year period, and a $2.0 million decrease in interest expense, which was attributable to the repayment of our convertible notes on April 1, 2016, partially offset by a $9.9 million increase in professional fees related to litigation and proxy-related matters.\nNet Investment Income\nAs a result of the $17.6 million decrease in total investment income and the $9.4 million decrease in net expenses, net investment income for the year ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $8.2 million, or 7.1%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2015.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Secured Borrowings\nRealized gain (loss) is the difference between the net proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and secured borrowings and their stated costs. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, we recorded investment realization events, including the following:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In October 2015, we received a cash payment of $23.3 million from Affordable Care, Inc. in full satisfaction of all obligations under the loan agreement.

This consisted of $147.0 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments, $0.6 million of net unrealized depreciation on equity investments and $0.1 million of net unrealized appreciation on secured borrowings, offset by $99.7 million of net reclassifications to realized losses (resulting in unrealized appreciation).\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2015, we recorded net unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings of $71.0 million.

For the year ended September 30, 2015, this amount primarily consisted of $229.3 million of interest income from\nportfolio investments (which included $13.4 million of PIK interest) and $22.3 million of fee income. For the year ended September 30,\n2014, this amount primarily consisted of $236.8 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $24.1 million of\nPIK interest) and $52.8 million of fee income.\nThe decrease in our total investment income for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2014, was primarily attributable to a decrease in fee income earned on new investments.\nExpenses\nNet expenses (expenses net of base management fee waivers) for the years ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014\nwere $150.5 million and $151.4 million, respectively. Net expenses decreased for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to\nthe year ended September 30, 2014, by $0.8 million, or 0.6%. This was due primarily to an increase of $5.2 million in interest expense, which was attributable to a 10.7% increase in weighted average debt outstanding for the year-over-year period, offset by a decrease of $6.9 million in Part I Incentive fees.\nNet Investment Income\nAs a result of the $28.5 million decrease in total investment income and the $0.8 million decrease in net expenses, net investment\nincome for the year ended September 30, 2015 reflected a $27.6 million, or 19.4%, decrease compared to the year ended September 30,\n2014.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Secured Borrowings\nRealized gain (loss) is the difference between the net proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and secured borrowings and their stated costs.

This consisted of $91.2 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments and $0.2 million of net unrealized depreciation on equity investments, offset by $19.7 million of net reclassifications to realized losses (resulting in unrealized appreciation) and $0.7 million of net unrealized depreciation on secured borrowings.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2014, we recorded net unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings of $32.2 million. This consisted of $31.9 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments, $0.1 million of net unrealized appreciation on secured borrowings and $3.4 million of net reclassifications to realized gains (resulting in unrealized depreciation), partially offset by $3.1 million of net unrealized appreciation on equity investments.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nWe have a number of alternatives available to fund our investment portfolio and our operations, including raising equity, increasing debt and funding from operational cash flow. Additionally, to generate liquidity we may reduce investment size by syndicating a portion of any given transaction. We intend to fund our future distribution obligations through operating cash flow or with funds obtained through future equity and debt offerings or credit facilities, as we deem appropriate.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $20.5 million. During that period, we received $164.8 million of net cash from operating activities, primarily from $818.2 million of principal payments, PIK payments and sale proceeds received and the cash activities related to $106.7 million of net investment income, partially offset by funding $735.5 million of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, net cash used by financing activities was $185.2 million, primarily consisting of $100.3 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders, $37.6 million of repurchases of common stock under stock repurchase program, $11.7 million of repayments of SBA debentures payable, $6.4 million of repurchases of common stock under our DRIP and $2.9 million of repayments of secured borrowings, partially offset by $89.0 million of net borrowings under our credit facilities (including borrowings to repay the $115.0 million Convertible Notes at maturity).\nFor the year ended September 30, 2015, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $51.6 million. During that period, we received $146.2 million of net cash from operating activities, primarily from $1.4 billion of principal payments, PIK\npayments and sale proceeds received and cash activities related to $114.9 million of net investment income, partially offset by funding $1.4 billion of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, net cash used by financing activities was $94.5 million, primarily consisting of $114.7 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders, $62.8 million of repayments of secured borrowings, $20.0 million of repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program (including treasury shares) and $6.0 million of repurchases of common stock under our DRIP, partially offset by $109.9 million of net borrowings under our credit facilities.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had $130.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (including $12.4 million of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $2.2 billion, $15.6 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $213.3 million of SBA debentures payable, $516.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, $410.6 million of unsecured notes payable, $18.4 million of secured borrowings and unfunded commitments of $215.7 million.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we had $143.5 million in cash and cash equivalents (including $5.1 million of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $2.4 billion, $15.7 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $225.0 million of SBA debentures payable, $427.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, $115.0 million of unsecured convertible notes payable, $410.3 million of unsecured notes payable, $21.2 million of secured borrowings and unfunded commitments of $305.3 million.\nOther Sources of Liquidity\nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, including interest earned, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time issue securities pursuant to a shelf registration statement or otherwise pursuant to private offerings. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful. In the future, we may also securitize a portion of our investments in first and second lien senior loans or unsecured debt or other assets. To securitize loans, we would likely create a wholly-owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We would then sell interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers and we would retain all or a portion of the equity in the subsidiary. Our primary use of funds is investments in our targeted asset classes and cash distributions to holders of our common stock.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, our plans to raise capital may not be successful. In this regard, because our common stock has at times traded at a price below our then-current net asset value per share (which has primarily been the case for the past year) and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital.\nIn addition, we intend to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income as dividends to our stockholders each taxable year in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code. See \"Regulated Investment Company Status and Distributions\" below. Consequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings. In addition, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value.\nAs a business development company, under the 1940 Act, we generally are not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 50% of the value of our assets). This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. We received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA, from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage ratio we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with this asset coverage requirement, as modified by our exemptive relief. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing. To fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future, we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources, including the equity markets and the securitization or other debt-related markets, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may from time to time be required to refinance previously issued debt securities upon their maturities. For example, we repaid in full our unsecured convertible notes on their maturity date of April 1, 2016. In order to fund this repayment, we utilized cash on hand and borrowings under our ING revolving credit facility.\nSignificant Capital Transactions\nThe following table reflects the distributions per

program authorizing us to repurchase up to $100 million in the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock through November 30, 2016. During the year ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 7,004,139 shares of our common stock for $37.6 million, net of commissions.\nOn November 28, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $12.5 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock through November 28, 2017. Common stock repurchases under the program are to be made in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at times, and in such amounts, as we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including our performance, capital availability, general economic and market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by us. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nBorrowings\nSBIC Subsidiaries\nOn February 3, 2010, the Company's consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners IV, L.P., or FSMP IV, received a license, effective February 1, 2010, from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. On May 15, 2012, our consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners V, L.P., or FSMP V, received a license, effective May 10, 2012, from the SBA to operate as an SBIC. SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses.\nThe SBIC licenses allow the SBIC subsidiaries to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a 10-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities.\nSBA regulations currently limit the amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that an SBIC may issue to $150 million when it has at least $75 million in regulatory capital. Affiliated SBICs are permitted to issue up to a combined maximum amount of $350 million of debentures when they have at least $175 million in regulatory capital.\nAs of September 30, 2016, FSMP IV had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $138.3 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a fair value of $131.0 million. As of September 30, 2015, FSMP IV had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $150.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a fair value of $137.4 million. As of September 30, 2016, these debentures bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 3.625% (excluding the SBA annual charge), as follows:\nTable 304: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate Fix Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debenture\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed\nInterest\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SBA\nAnnual\nCharge\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.215\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.285\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of September 30, 2016 and 2015, FSMP V had $37.5 million in regulatory capital and $75.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a fair value of $67.5 million and $65.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2015, these debentures bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 2.835% (excluding the SBA annual charge), as follows:\nTable 305: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate Fix Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debenture\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed\nInterest\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SBA\nAnnual Charge\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.351\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.804\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of September 30, 2016, the $213.3 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures held by the SBIC Subsidiaries carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.348% (excluding the SBA annual charge).\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded aggregate interest expense of $9.5 million, $9.3 million and $8.6 million, respectively, related to the SBA-guaranteed debentures of the SBIC subsidiaries.\nThe SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to repurchase their capital stock. SBA regulations also include restrictions on a \"change of control\" or transfer of an SBIC and require that SBICs invest idle funds in accordance with SBA regulations. In addition, the SBIC Subsidiaries may also be limited in their ability to make distributions to the Company if they do not have sufficient capital, in accordance with SBA regulations.\nThe SBIC subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. Receipt of an SBIC license does not assure that our SBIC subsidiaries will\nreceive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding and is further dependent upon our SBIC subsidiaries continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies.\nThe SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to our SBIC subsidiaries' assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate our SBIC subsidiaries or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by the SBIC subsidiaries upon an event of default.\nWe have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the Company's 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This allows us increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us, as of September 30, 2016, to borrow up to $213.3 million more than we would otherwise be able to under the 1940 Act absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.\nAs of September 30, 2016, except for assets that were funded through our SBIC subsidiaries and our investment in SLF JV I, substantially all of our assets were pledged as collateral under the ING facility or the Sumitomo facility.\nWe and our SBIC subsidiaries are also subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to our borrowings. For a discussion of such requirements, see \"Item 1. Business - Regulation - Business Development Company Regulations\" and \"- Small Business Investment Company Regulations\" in this Form 10-K.\nING Facility\nOn May 27, 2010, we entered into the ING facility pursuant to a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, or ING Credit Agreement, with certain lenders party thereto from time to time and ING Capital LLC, as administrative agent. The ING facility provides that we may use the proceeds and letters of credit under the facility for general corporate purposes, including acquiring and funding leveraged loans, mezzanine loans, high-yield securities, convertible securities, preferred stock, common stock and other investments. The ING facility allows us to request letters of credit from ING Capital LLC, as the issuing bank.\nAs of September 30, 2016, the ING facility permitted up to $710 million of borrowings with an accordion feature allowing for future expansion of the facility up to a total of $800 million, and borrowings under the facility bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (1-, 2-, 3- or 6-month, at our option) plus 2.25% per annum, with no LIBOR floor, assuming we maintain our current credit rating. Unless extended, the period during which we may make and reinvest borrowings under the facility will expire on August 6, 2017, and the maturity date of the facility is August 6, 2018.\nThe ING facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, as well as the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, FSFC Holdings, Inc., or Holdings, and our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Fund of Funds LLC, or Fund of Funds, subject to certain exclusions for, among other things, equity interests in our SBIC subsidiaries and equity interests in Funding II (as defined below) as set forth in a Guarantee, Pledge and Security Agreement, or the ING Security Agreement, entered into in connection with the ING Credit Agreement, among Holdings, ING Capital LLC, as collateral agent, and us. Fund of Funds and Holdings were formed to hold certain of our portfolio companies for tax purposes and have no other operations.\nPursuant to the ING Security Agreement, Holdings and Fund of Funds guaranteed the obligations under the ING Security Agreement, including our obligations to the lenders and the administrative agent under the ING Credit Agreement. Additionally, we pledged our entire equity interest in Holdings and Holdings pledged its entire equity interest in Fund of Funds to the collateral agent pursuant to the terms of the ING Security Agreement. None of our SBIC subsidiaries, Fifth Street Funding, LLC or Fifth Street Funding II, LLC is party to the ING facility and their respective assets have not been pledged in connection therewith.\nThe ING Credit Agreement and related agreements governing the ING facility required Holdings, Fund of Funds and us to, among other things, (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well as each of our portfolio companies' businesses, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) agree to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The ING facility documents also include usual and customary default provisions such as the failure to make timely payments under the facility, the occurrence of a change in control, and the failure by us to materially perform under the ING Credit Agreement and related agreements governing the facility, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility. Any such non-compliance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the ING facility.\nEach loan or letter of credit originated under the ING facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We cannot be assured that we will be able to borrow funds under the ING facility at any particular time or at all.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had $472.5 million of borrowings outstanding under the ING facility, which had a fair value of $472.5 million. Our borrowings under the ING facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 2.781% for the year ended September 30, 2016. For the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $15.1 million, $13.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively, related to the ING facility.\nSumitomo Facility\nOn September 16, 2011, Fifth Street Funding II, LLC, a consolidated wholly-owned bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiary, or Funding II, entered into a Loan and Servicing Agreement, or, as subsequently amended, the Sumitomo Agreement, with respect to the Sumitomo facility, with SMBC, an affiliate of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc., as administrative agent, and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto, in the amount of $200 million.\nAs of September 30, 2016, the Sumitomo facility permitted up to $125 million of borrowings (subject to collateral requirements), and borrowings under the facility bore interest at a rate of either (i) LIBOR (1-month) plus 2.00% per annum, with no LIBOR floor, if the borrowings under the Sumitomo facility are greater than 35% of the aggregate available borrowings under the Sumitomo facility or (ii) LIBOR (1-month) plus 2.25% per annum, if the borrowings under the Sumitomo Facility are less than or equal to 35% of the aggregate available borrowings under the Sumitomo facility. Unless extended, the period during which we may make and reinvest borrowings under the facility will expire on September 16, 2017, and the maturity date of the facility is September 16, 2021.\nIn connection with the Sumitomo facility, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Funding II, pursuant to which we will sell to Funding II certain loan assets we have originated or acquired, or will originate or acquire.\nThe Sumitomo Agreement and related agreements governing the Sumitomo facility required both Funding II and us to, among other things, (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well as each of our businesses, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) comply with various covenants, servicing procedures, limitations on acquiring and disposing of assets, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities, including a prepayment penalty in certain cases. The Sumitomo facility agreements also include usual and customary default provisions such as the failure to make timely payments under the facility, a change in control of Funding II, and the failure by Funding II or us to materially perform under the Sumitomo Agreement and related agreements governing the Sumitomo facility, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility. Any such non-compliance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Funding II was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the Sumitomo facility and has no other operations. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Sumitomo facility.\nThe Sumitomo facility is secured by all of the assets of Funding II. Each loan origination under the Sumitomo facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We cannot be assured that Funding II will be able to borrow funds under the Sumitomo facility at any particular time or at all.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had $43.8 million of borrowings outstanding under the Sumitomo facility, which had a fair value of $43.8 million. Our borrowings under the Sumitomo facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 2.432% for the year ended September 30, 2016. For the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $1.9 million, $1.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to the Sumitomo facility.\nThe Sumitomo facility does not require us to comply with significant financial covenants. The following table describes significant financial covenants with which we must comply under the ING facility on a quarterly basis:\nTable 306: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Covenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Target Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reported Value (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net assets shall not be less than the greater of (a) 40% of total assets and (b) $825 million plus 50% of the aggregate net proceeds of all sales of equity interests after August 6, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$990 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,184 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Asset coverage ratio shall not be less than 2.10:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.10:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.19:1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest coverage ratio shall not be less than 2.50:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.50:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.04:1\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________\n(1) As contractually required, we report financial covenants based on the last filed quarterly or annual report, in this case our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.

Tannenbaum, our former Chief Executive Officer. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated April 12, 2011 or, the Indenture, between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, or the Trustee.\nThe Convertible Notes matured on April 1, 2016, or Maturity Date and we repaid in full the $115.0 million of outstanding Convertible Notes on the Maturity Date using cash on hand and borrowings under the ING facility.\nThe Convertible Notes bore interest at a rate of 5.375% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Convertible Notes were our unsecured obligations and ranked senior in right of payment to our indebtedness that was expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.\nOn or after January 1, 2016 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders could have converted their Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion, we would have been obligated to deliver shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate that was subject to periodic adjustment.\nWe could not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. No sinking fund was provided for the Convertible Notes. In addition, if certain corporate events occurred in respect to us, holders of the Convertible Notes could have required us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the required repurchase date.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $3.4 million, $6.8 million and $6.8 million related to the Convertible Notes.\n2019 Notes\nOn February 26, 2014, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% 2019 Notes for net proceeds of $244.4 million after deducting original issue discount of $1.4 million, underwriting commissions and discounts of $3.7 million and offering costs of $0.5 million. The original issue discount on these notes is amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the notes.\nThe 2019 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the supplemental indenture, dated February 26, 2014, or collectively, the 2019 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2019 Notes are our general unsecured obligations that rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated. The 2019 Notes effectively rank junior to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 2019 Notes rank structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.\nInterest on the 2019 Notes is paid semi-annually on March 1 and September 1, at a rate of 4.875% per annum. The 2019 Notes mature on March 1, 2019 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option prior to maturity.\nThe 2019 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2019 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2019 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2019 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, holders of the 2019 Notes can require us to repurchase the 2019 Notes at 100% of their principal amount upon the occurrence of certain change of control events as described in the 2019 Notes Indenture. The 2019 Notes were issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we did not repurchase any of the 2019 Notes in the open market.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $13.3 million, $13.4 million and $7.8 million, respectively, related to the 2019 Notes.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $250.0 million of 2019 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of $256.9 million.\n2024 Notes\nOn October 18, 2012, we issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% 2024 Notes for net proceeds of $72.5 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $2.2 million and offering costs of $0.3 million.\nThe 2024 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated October 18, 2012, or collectively, the 2024 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2024 Notes are our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.\nInterest on the 2024 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 at a rate of 5.875% per annum. The 2024 Notes mature on October 30, 2024 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after October 30, 2017. The 2024 Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol \"FSCE\" with a par value of $25.00 per note.\nThe 2024 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and with the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2024 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2024 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2024 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Any 2024 Notes repurchased by us may, at our option, be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, but may not be reissued or resold by us. Any 2024 Notes surrendered for cancellation will be promptly canceled and no longer outstanding under the 2024 Notes Indenture. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we did not repurchase any of the 2024 Notes in the open market.\nFor each of the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $4.6 million related to the 2024 Notes.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $75.0 million of 2024 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of $76.7 million.\n2028 Notes\nIn April and May 2013, we issued $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% 2028 Notes, for net proceeds of $83.4 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $2.6 million and offering costs of $0.3 million.\nThe 2028 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the second supplemental indenture, dated April 4, 2013, or collectively, the 2028 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2028 Notes are our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of\npayment to the 2028 Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.\nInterest on the 2028 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 at a rate of 6.125% per annum. The 2028 Notes mature on April 30, 2028 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after April 30, 2018. The 2028 Notes are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol \"FSCFL\" with a par value of $25.00 per note.\nThe 2028 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2028 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2028 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2028 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Any 2028 Notes repurchased by us may, at our option, be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, but may not be reissued or resold by us. Any 2028 Notes surrendered for cancellation will be promptly canceled and no longer outstanding under the 2028 Notes Indenture. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we did not repurchase any of the 2028 Notes in the open market.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $5.5 million related to the 2028 Notes.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $86.3 million 2028 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of $88.7 million.\nSecured Borrowings\nWe follow the guidance in ASC 860 when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. Such guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a \"participating interest,\" as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are carried at fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2016, secured borrowings at fair value totaled $18.4 million and the fair value of the loan that is associated with these secured borrowings was $52.1 million. These secured borrowings were the result of the completion of partial loan sales totaling $22.8 million of a senior secured debt investment during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 that did not meet the definition of a participating interest. As a result, sale treatment was not allowed and these partial loan sales were treated as secured borrowings. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, there were $2.9 million and $62.8 million of repayments on secured borrowings, respectively.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $1.5 million, $1.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, related to the secured borrowings.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $18.9 million of secured borrowings outstanding, which had a fair value of $18.4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2016, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $215.7 million of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of $191.7 million to provide debt financing to certain of our portfolio companies, $14.1 million to provide debt and equity financing to SLF JV I and $9.9 million related to unfunded limited partnership interests. As of September 30, 2015, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $305.3 million of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of $260.2 million to provide debt financing to certain of our portfolio companies, $30.7 million to provide debt and equity financing to SLF JV I and $14.4 million related to unfunded limited partnership interests. Such commitments are subject to our portfolio companies' satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. We believe that our assets will provide adequate cover to satisfy all of our unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2016.\nA summary of the composition of unfunded commitments (consisting of revolvers, term loans with delayed draw components, SLF JV I subordinated notes and LLC interests, and limited partnership interests) as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 is\nshown in the

Subchapter M of the Code. As long as we continue to qualify as a RIC, we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed as dividends, to stockholders on a timely basis.\nTaxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized. Distributions declared and paid by us in a taxable year may differ from taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of taxable income derived from the current taxable year or the distribution of taxable income derived from the prior taxable year carried forward into and distributed in the current taxable year. Distributions also may include returns of capital.\nTo maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute, with respect to each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company net taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any), determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. As a RIC, we are also subject to a federal excise tax, based on distribution requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis (e.g., calendar year 2014). We anticipate timely distribution of our taxable income in accordance with tax rules. We did not incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar years 2014 and 2015 and do not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for the calendar year 2016. We may incur a federal excise tax in future years.\nWe intend to distribute to our stockholders between 90% and 100% of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income). However, we are partially dependent on our SBIC subsidiaries for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirements. Our SBIC subsidiaries may be limited by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to enable us to maintain our status as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA's restrictions for our SBIC subsidiaries to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC status. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. Also, the covenants under the Sumitomo facility could, under certain circumstances, restrict Funding and Funding II from making distributions to us and, as a result, hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. Similarly, the covenants contained in the ING facility may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders, and, as a result, could hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal and taxable year fall below\nthe total amount of our dividend distributions for that fiscal and taxable year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our credit facilities and debt instruments. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our taxable income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.\nA RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to certain limitations regarding the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these guidelines.\nWe may generate qualified interest income that may be exempt from United States withholding tax on foreign accounts. A regulated RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified interest income and short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. The following table, which may be subject to change as we finalize our annual tax filings, lists the percentage of qualified interest income and qualified short-term capital gains for the three months ended December 31, 2015 March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016.\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Qualified Interest Income\n</td> <td>Qualified Short-Term Capital Gains\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCumulative qualified interest income for the year ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $85.0 million or 79.71% of total taxable distributions.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have entered into an investment advisory agreement with our Investment Adviser. Messrs. Berman, Dimitrov, Owens and Sandeep K. Khorana, each an interested member of our Board of Directors, have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in our Investment Adviser. The Investment Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, that is partially and indirectly owned by FSAM. As of September 30, 2016, fees payable to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the investment advisory agreement equaled (a) a base management fee of 1.75% of the value of our gross assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes and excludes cash and cash equivalents, and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and the fee for any partial month or quarter is appropriately prorated. The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals 20% of our \"Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income\" for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a preferred return, or \"hurdle,\" and a \"catch up\" feature. The catch-up\u201d provision is intended to provide our investment adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. The second part is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the investment advisory agreement) and equals 20% of our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fee. The investment advisory agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than 60 days' written notice to the other. During the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we incurred fees of $63.6 million, $80.2 million and $87.2 million, respectively, under the investment advisory agreement. While under no obligation to do so, for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Investment Adviser voluntarily and irrevocably waived a portion of the base management fee relating to partial loan sales that did not qualify for true sale accounting, which resulted a waiver of $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nPrior to December 31, 2015, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2% of our gross assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes but excludes any cash and cash equivalents held at the end of each quarter.\nOn January 20, 2016, we announced that our Investment Adviser has agreed to an amendment to the investment advisory agreement to permanently reduce the base management fee. Beginning January 1, 2016, the base management fee on total gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was reduced from 2% to 1.75%. The other commercial terms of our existing investment advisory arrangement with our Investment Adviser remained unchanged.\nOn July 14, 2015, we announced that our Investment Adviser voluntarily agreed to a revised base management fee arrangement, or the Revised Management Fee, for the period commencing on July 1, 2015 and remaining in effect until January 1, 2017, or the Waiver Period.\nThe Revised Management Fee is intended to provide for a reduction in the base management fee payable by us our Investment Adviser during the Waiver Period. Neither the prior waiver of base management fees nor the Revised Management Fee in any way implies that our Investment Adviser will agree to waive management or incentive fees in any future period. The Revised Management Fee will be calculated quarterly and will be equal to our gross assets, including assets acquired with borrowed funds, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by 0.25 multiplied by the sum of (x) and (y), expressed as a percentage, where (x) is equal to 2% multiplied by the Baseline NAV Percentage, and (y) is equal to 1% multiplied by the Incremental NAV Percentage. The \"Baseline NAV Percentage\" is the percentage derived by dividing our net asset value as of March 31, 2015 (i.e., $1,407,774,000), or the Baseline NAV, by the net asset value at the beginning of the fiscal quarter for which the fee is being calculated, or the New NAV. The Incremental NAV Percentage\u201d is the percentage derived by dividing the New NAV in excess of the Baseline NAV by the New NAV.\nThe Revised Management Fee modifies the base management fee payable to our Investment Adviser pursuant to our investment advisory agreement with our Investment Adviser and results in a blended annual base management fee rate that will not be less than 1%, or greater than 1.75%. The initial computation of the Revised Management Fee will occur at the end of the quarter following the quarter in which we issue or sell shares of our common stock, including new shares issued as dividends or pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan, but excluding non-ordinary course transactions as outlined below. Prior to that time, the annual base management fee rate will remain at 1.75%. Moreover, if any recalculation of the base management fee rate would otherwise result in an increase of the blended rate used, the blended rate in effect immediately prior to such recalculation would remain in effect until such time, if any, as a recalculation following an equity issuance would result in a lower fee rate.\nPursuant to the administration agreement with FSC CT, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of our investment adviser, FSC CT furnishes us with the facilities, including our principal executive offices, and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, including equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services at such facilities. In addition, FSC CT will assist us in connection with the determination and publishing of our net asset value, the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders. We pay FSC CT its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by FSC CT in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including a portion of the rent at market rates and the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than 60 days' written notice to the other. During the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we incurred expenses of $4.0 million, $6.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively, under the administration agreement.\nWe have also entered into a license agreement with Fifth Street Capital LLC pursuant to which Fifth Street Capital LLC has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name \"Fifth Street.\" Under this agreement, we will have a right to use the \"Fifth Street\" name, for so long as Fifth Street Management LLC or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we will have no legal right to the \"Fifth Street\" name. Fifth Street Capital LLC is controlled by Mr. Tannenbaum, our Investment Adviser's chief executive officer.\nAs of September 30, 2016, FSAM held 8,399,520 shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 5.9% of our common stock outstanding.\nRecent Developments\nOn October 18, 2016, our Board of Directors declared the following distributions:\nTable 318: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> $0.06 per share, payable on December 30, 2016 to stockholders of record on December 15, 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 319: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> $0.06 per share, payable on January 31, 2017 to stockholders of record on January 13, 2017; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 320: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> $0.06 per share, payable on February 28, 2017 to stockholders of record on February 15, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> On November 28, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $12.5 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock through November 28, 2017. Common stock repurchases under the program are to be made in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at times, and in such amounts, as we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including our performance, capital availability, general economic and market conditions,\nregulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by us. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nFor a discussion of the developments in the litigation to which we are a party, see Part II - Other Information - Item 1.

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code, for tax purposes.\nWe generally lend to and invest in small and mid-sized companies, primarily in connection with investments by private equity sponsors. We define small and mid-sized companies as those with annual EBITDA between $10 million and $120 million. Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio's total return by generating current income from our debt investments, and to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from our equity investments.\nWe are externally managed by the Investment Adviser, a subsidiary of FSAM, a publicly traded alternative asset manager, pursuant to an investment advisory agreement. FSC CT, a subsidiary of the Investment Adviser, also provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for the fair presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements have been made. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We are an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies, or ASC 946.\nInvestment Valuation\nWe are required to report our investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The fair value is deemed to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nWe value our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.\nHierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. \n \u2022 Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. \n \u2022 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. Generally, it is expected that all of our investment securities will be valued using Level 3 inputs. This includes investment securities that are valued using \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments are generally classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions.\nFinancial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, our Investment Adviser's capital markets group obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by independent pricing services for all of our senior secured debt investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing services use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations.\nOur Investment Adviser evaluates the prices obtained from independent pricing services based on available market information and company specific data that could affect the credit quality and/or fair value of the investment. Investments for which market quotations are readily available may be valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, our Investment Adviser looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Our Investment Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe any such market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. Examples of these events could include cases when a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale or in the event of a \"fire sale\" by a distressed seller. In these instances, we value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available (as discussed below).\nIf the quotation provided by the pricing service is based on only one or two market sources, we perform additional procedures to corroborate such information, which may include the bond yield approach discussed below and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit quality and market trends affecting the portfolio company.\nWe perform detailed valuations of our debt and equity investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are deemed not to represent fair value of the investments. We typically use two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value, or EV, of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA. EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. We may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is typically performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other alternative methods such as an asset liquidation model, expected recovery model or a recent observable or pending transaction may be utilized to estimate EV. The second valuation technique is a bond yield approach, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. To determine fair value using a bond yield approach, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the bond yield approach, we consider the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, we depend on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.\nWe estimate the fair value of privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions including, but not limited to, the current stock price (by analyzing the portfolio company's operating performance and financial condition and general market conditions), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nOur Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments:\n \u2022 The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by our Investment Adviser's valuation team in conjunction with the Investment Adviser's portfolio management and capital markets teams;  \u2022Preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with principals of our Investment Adviser;\n \u2022 Separately, independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors prepare valuations of our investments, on a selected basis, for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment, and submit the reports to us and provide such reports to our Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors; \n \u2022 The Investment Adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors; \n \u2022 The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuations with the portfolio managers of the Investment Adviser and our Investment Adviser responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between our Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee; \n \u2022 The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors makes a recommendation to our Board of Directors regarding the fair value of the investments in our portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available; and \n \u2022 Our Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available in good faith.  The fair value of our investments at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has authorized the engagement of independent valuation firms to provide valuation assistance. We will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter. As of September 30, 2016, 89.8% of our portfolio at fair value was valued by independent valuation firms. The percentage of our portfolio valued by independent valuation firms may vary from period to period based on the\navailability of market quotations for our portfolio investments during the respective periods. However, our Board of Directors is ultimately and solely responsible for the valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nThe percentages of our portfolio, at fair value, valued by independent valuation firms as of the end of each period during the current and two preceding fiscal years were as follows:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, approximately 92.0% and 92.9%, respectively, of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies valued at prices equal to fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest income, adjusted for accretion of original issue discount, or OID, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. In connection with our investment, we sometimes receive nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the particular portfolio company. When we receive nominal cost equity, we allocate our cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. Distributions of income from portfolio companies are generally recorded as dividend income on the ex-dividend date.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were five investments on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.\nFee Income\nWe receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of business, including servicing, advisory, amendment, structuring and prepayment fees, which are classified as fee income and recognized as they are earned.\nWe have also structured exit fees across certain of our portfolio investments to be received upon the future exit of those investments. Exit fees are payable upon the exit of a debt security. These fees are to be paid to us upon the sooner to occur of (i) a sale of the borrower or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, (ii) the maturity date of the loan or (iii) the date when full prepayment of the loan occurs. The receipt of such fees is contingent upon the occurrence of one of the events listed above for each of the investments. A percentage of these fees is included in net investment income over the life of the loan. As of September 30, 2016, we had structured $2.8 million in aggregate exit fees across three portfolio investments upon the future exit of those investments.\nPIK Interest\nOur loans may contain contractual PIK interest provisions. The PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We generally cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. Our decision to cease accruing PIK interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; our assessment of the portfolio company's business development success, including product development, profitability and the portfolio company's overall adherence to its\nbusiness plan; information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. Based on this and other information, we determine whether to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security when it is determined that PIK interest is no longer collectible. Our determination to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security is generally made well before our full write-down of such loan or debt security. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements and, as a result, increases the cost basis of these investments for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser.\nFor a discussion of risks we are subject to as a result of our use of PIK interest in connection with our investments, see \"Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure - We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we are required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes before or without receiving cash representing such income,\" \"- We may in the future choose to pay distributions partly in our own stock, in which case you may be subject to tax in excess of the cash you receive\" and \"- Our incentive fee may induce our Investment Adviser to make speculative investments\" in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments both in our Consolidated Financial Statements and for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser.\nTo maintain our status as a RIC, PIK income must be paid out to our stockholders as distributions, even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never collect the cash relating to the PIK interest. Accumulated PIK interest was $62.6 million, or 2.9%, of the fair value of our portfolio of investments as of September 30, 2016 and $50.7 million, or 2.1%, as of September 30, 2015. The net increases in loan balances as a result of contractual PIK arrangements are separately identified in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nPortfolio Composition\nOur investments principally consist of loans, purchased equity investments and equity grants in privately-held companies and SLF JV I. Our loans are typically secured by a first, second or subordinated lien on the assets of the portfolio company and generally have terms of up to seven years (but an expected average life of between three and four years). We are currently focusing our origination efforts on a prudent mix of senior secured and subordinated loans which we believe will provide attractive risk-adjusted returns while maintaining adequate credit protection. The mix may change over time based on market conditions and management's view of where the best risk- adjusted returns are available.\nA summary of the composition of our investment portfolio at cost

employ a ranking system to assess and monitor the credit risk of our investment portfolio. We rank all investments on a scale from 1 to 4. The system is intended to reflect the performance of the borrower's business, the collateral coverage of the loan, and other factors considered relevant to making a credit judgment. We have determined that there should be an individual ranking assigned to each tranche of securities in the same portfolio company where appropriate. This may arise when the perceived risk of loss on the investment varies significantly between tranches due to their respective seniority in the capital structure.\n \u2022 Investment Ranking 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations and/or capital gains are expected. \n \u2022 Investment Ranking 2 is used for investments that are performing substantially within our expectations, and whose risks \nremain materially consistent with the potential risks at the time of the original or restructured investment. All new investments are initially ranked 2.\n \u2022 Investment Ranking 3 is used for investments that are performing below our expectations and for which risk has materially increased since the original or restructured investment. The portfolio company may be out of compliance with debt covenants and may require closer monitoring. To the extent that the underlying agreement has a PIK interest provision, investments with a ranking of 3 are generally those on which we are not accruing PIK interest. \n \u2022 Investment Ranking 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below our expectations and for which risk has increased substantially since the original or restructured investment. Investments with a ranking of 4 are those for which some loss of principal is expected and are generally those on which we are not accruing cash interest.

We may from time to time modify the payment terms of our investments, either in response to current economic conditions and their impact on certain of our portfolio companies or in accordance with tier pricing provisions in certain loan agreements. As of September 30, 2016, we had modified the payment terms of our investments in 16 portfolio companies. Such modified terms may include increased PIK interest provisions and reduced cash interest rates. These modifications, and any future modifications to our loan agreements, may limit the amount of interest income that we recognize from the modified investments, which may, in turn, limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nLoans and Debt Securities on Non-Accrual Status\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were five investments on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.

On July 1, 2014, SLF JV I began investing in senior secured loans of middle market companies and other corporate debt securities. We co-invest in these securities with Kemper through our investment in SLF JV I. SLF JV I is managed by a four person board of directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by Kemper. SLF JV I is capitalized pro rata with subordinated notes and LLC equity interests as transactions are completed. The subordinated notes mature on May 2, 2021. All portfolio decisions and investment decisions in respect of SLF JV I must be approved by the SLF JV I investment committee, which consists of one representative from us and one representative of Kemper (with approval from a representative of each required). As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we and Kemper owned, in the aggregate, 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of each of the outstanding subordinated notes and LLC equity interests.\nSLF JV I has a $200.0 million Deutsche Bank facility with a maturity date of July 1, 2019. Borrowings under the Deutsche Bank facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum. $100.0 million and $188.6 million was outstanding under this facility as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.\nSLF JV I also has a $200.0 million Credit Suisse facility, bringing SLF JV I's total debt capacity to $400.0 million. The Credit Suisse facility has a maturity date of July 7, 2023 and borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum. $67.0 million and $53.0 million was outstanding under this facility as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.\nBorrowings under the Deutsche Bank facility and Credit Suisse facility are secured by all of the assets of the respective special purpose financing vehicles of SLF JV I.\nWe have determined that SLF JV I is an investment company under ASC 946, however, in accordance with such guidance, we will generally not consolidate our investment in a company other than a wholly-owned investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to us. Accordingly, we do not consolidate our noncontrolling interest in SLF JV I.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, SLF JV I had total assets of $338.5 million and $419.0 million, respectively. Our investment in SLF JV I consisted of LLC equity interests of $13.7 million and subordinated notes of $129.0 million, at fair value as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2015, our investment consisted of LLC equity interests of $12.2 million and subordinated notes of $128.9 million, at fair value. The subordinated notes are junior in right of payment to the repayment of temporary contributions made by us to fund investments of SLF JV I that are repaid when Kemper makes its capital contributions. SLF JV I's portfolio consisted of middle market and other corporate debt securities of 37 and 34 \"eligible portfolio companies\" (as defined in the Section 2(a)(46) of the 1940 Act) as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The portfolio companies in SLF JV I are in industries similar to those in which we may invest directly.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, SLF JV I had total capital commitments of $200.0 million, $175.0 million of which was from us and the remaining $25.0 million from Kemper. Approximately $183.9 million and $164.9 million was funded as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, relating to these commitments, of which $160.9 million and $144.3 million, respectively, was from us. As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we had commitments to fund subordinated notes to SLF JV I of $157.5 million, of which $12.7 million and $27.6 million was unfunded, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we had commitments to fund LLC equity interests in SLF JV I of $17.5 million, of which $1.4 million and $3.1 million was unfunded, respectively.\nBelow is a summary of SLF JV I's portfolio, followed by a listing of the individual loans in SLF JV I's portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured loans (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$324,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$395,193\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate on senior secured loans (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.84%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.99%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of borrowers in SLF JV I\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Largest exposure to a single borrower (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$19,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$30,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total of five largest loan exposures to borrowers (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$93,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$109,959\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n(1) At principal amount.\n(2) Computed using the annual interest rate on accruing senior secured loans.\nSLF JV I Portfolio as of September 30, 2016\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Company (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Industry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Interest Rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AccentCare, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Healthcare services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First Lien\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9/3/2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR+5.75% (1% floor)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AdVenture Interactive, Corp.

All interest rates are payable in cash, unless otherwise noted.\n(2) Represents the fair value determined utilizing a similar process as us in accordance with ASC 820. However, the determination of such fair value is not included in our Board of Directors' valuation process described elsewhere herein.\n(3) This investment was held by both us and SLF JV I at September 30, 2015.\n(4) The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for all floating rate loans is indexed to LIBOR and an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. For each of these loans, we have provided the applicable margin over LIBOR based on each respective credit agreement.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of the subordinated notes held by us was $144.8 million and $129.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016 and $129.9 million and $128.9 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2015. The subordinated notes bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 8.0% per annum, and we earned interest income of $12.0 million and $6.9 million on our investments in these notes for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The cost and fair value of the LLC equity interests held by us was $16.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016, and $14.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2015.

The subordinated notes are valued by calculating the net present value of the future expected cash flow streams using an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate model.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, we sold $99.4 million of senior secured debt investments at fair value to SLF JV I in exchange for $92.8 million cash consideration, $5.9 million of subordinated notes and $0.7 million of LLC equity interests in SLF JV I. We recognized a $0.9 million realized loss on these transactions.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2015, we sold $310.4 million of senior secured debt investments to SLF JV I at fair value in exchange for $256.1 million cash consideration, $48.9 million of subordinated notes and $5.4 million of LLC equity interests in SLF JV I. We recognized a $0.5 million realized loss on these transactions.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results and Operations\nOut-of-Period Adjustments\nWe previously identified accounting errors from fiscal years ended 2012 through 2015 related to revenue recognition and consolidation. The revenue recognition errors were the result of certain fees which were historically recognized on the deal closing date, but should have been amortized over the life of the loan since the fees did not represent a separately identifiable revenue contract. These errors were partially offset by the overpayment of Part I Incentive Fees paid to the Investment Adviser. There were also errors resulting from not historically consolidating wholly-owned holding companies that should have been consolidated (First Star holding companies). We assessed the materiality of the errors on our prior quarterly and annual financial statements, assessing materiality both quantitatively and qualitatively, in accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 99 and SAB 108 and concluded that the errors were not material to any of the previously issued financial statements. However, we recorded a cumulative out-of-period adjustment for the three months ended December 31, 2014 to correct these errors prior to October 1, 2014. These errors did not impact the financial information for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the out-of-period adjustment.\nResults of Operations\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees, and other investment income and total expenses. Net realized gain (loss) on investments and secured borrowings is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and secured borrowings and their stated costs. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio and secured borrowings during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation (depreciation) when gains or losses are realized.\nComparison of Years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015\nTotal Investment Income\nTotal investment income includes interest on our investments, fee income and other investment income. Fee income consists of the monthly servicing fees, advisory fees, structuring fees, exit fees and prepayment fees that we receive in connection with our debt investments. These fees are recognized as earned. Other investment income consists primarily of dividend income received from certain of our equity investments.\nTotal investment income for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $247.9 million and $265.5 million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2016, this amount primarily consisted of $211.2 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $14.0 million of PIK interest) and $22.7 million of fee income. For the year ended September 30, 2015, this amount primarily consisted of $229.3 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $13.4 million of PIK interest) and $22.3 million of fee income.\nTotal investment income for the year ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2015, decreased primarily due to lower interest income from a decrease in the size of our investment portfolio and additional investments on which we stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.\nExpenses\nNet expenses (expenses net of base management fee waivers and insurance recoveries) for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $141.1 million and $150.5 million, respectively. Net expenses decreased for the years ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the years ended September 30, 2015, by $9.4 million, or 6.2%, due primarily to a $9.9 million decrease in base management fees, which was attributable to the permanent fee reduction that we agreed to with our investment adviser effective January 1, 2016, a $6.5 million decrease in Part I incentive fees, which was attributable to lower pre-incentive fee net investment income for the year-over-year period, and a $2.0 million decrease in interest expense, which was attributable to the repayment of our convertible notes on April 1, 2016, partially offset by a $9.9 million increase in professional fees related to litigation and proxy-related matters.\nNet Investment Income\nAs a result of the $17.6 million decrease in total investment income and the $9.4 million decrease in net expenses, net investment income for the year ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $8.2 million, or 7.1%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2015.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Secured Borrowings\nRealized gain (loss) is the difference between the net proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and secured borrowings and their stated costs. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, we recorded investment realization events, including the following:\n \u2022 In October 2015, we received a cash payment of $23.3 million from Affordable Care, Inc. in full satisfaction of all obligations under the loan agreement.

For the year ended September 30,\n2014, this amount primarily consisted of $236.8 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $24.1 million of\nPIK interest) and $52.8 million of fee income.\nThe decrease in our total investment income for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2014, was primarily attributable to a decrease in fee income earned on new investments.\nExpenses\nNet expenses (expenses net of base management fee waivers) for the years ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014\nwere $150.5 million and $151.4 million, respectively.

This was due primarily to an increase of $5.2 million in interest expense, which was attributable to a 10.7% increase in weighted average debt outstanding for the year-over-year period, offset by a decrease of $6.9 million in Part I Incentive fees.\nNet Investment Income\nAs a result of the $28.5 million decrease in total investment income and the $0.8 million decrease in net expenses, net investment\nincome for the year ended September 30, 2015 reflected a $27.6 million, or 19.4%, decrease compared to the year ended September 30,\n2014.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Secured Borrowings\nRealized gain (loss) is the difference between the net proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and secured borrowings and their stated costs.

Additionally, to generate liquidity we may reduce investment size by syndicating a portion of any given transaction. We intend to fund our future distribution obligations through operating cash flow or with funds obtained through future equity and debt offerings or credit facilities, as we deem appropriate.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $20.5 million. During that period, we received $164.8 million of net cash from operating activities, primarily from $818.2 million of principal payments, PIK payments and sale proceeds received and the cash activities related to $106.7 million of net investment income, partially offset by funding $735.5 million of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, net cash used by financing activities was $185.2 million, primarily consisting of $100.3 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders, $37.6 million of repurchases of common stock under stock repurchase program, $11.7 million of repayments of SBA debentures payable, $6.4 million of repurchases of common stock under our DRIP and $2.9 million of repayments of secured borrowings, partially offset by $89.0 million of net borrowings under our credit facilities (including borrowings to repay the $115.0 million Convertible Notes at maturity).\nFor the year ended September 30, 2015, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $51.6 million. During that period, we received $146.2 million of net cash from operating activities, primarily from $1.4 billion of principal payments, PIK\npayments and sale proceeds received and cash activities related to $114.9 million of net investment income, partially offset by funding $1.4 billion of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, net cash used by financing activities was $94.5 million, primarily consisting of $114.7 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders, $62.8 million of repayments of secured borrowings, $20.0 million of repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program (including treasury shares) and $6.0 million of repurchases of common stock under our DRIP, partially offset by $109.9 million of net borrowings under our credit facilities.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had $130.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (including $12.4 million of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $2.2 billion, $15.6 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $213.3 million of SBA debentures payable, $516.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, $410.6 million of unsecured notes payable, $18.4 million of secured borrowings and unfunded commitments of $215.7 million.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we had $143.5 million in cash and cash equivalents (including $5.1 million of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $2.4 billion, $15.7 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $225.0 million of SBA debentures payable, $427.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, $115.0 million of unsecured convertible notes payable, $410.3 million of unsecured notes payable, $21.2 million of secured borrowings and unfunded commitments of $305.3 million.\nOther Sources of Liquidity\nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, including interest earned, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time issue securities pursuant to a shelf registration statement or otherwise pursuant to private offerings. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful. In the future, we may also securitize a portion of our investments in first and second lien senior loans or unsecured debt or other assets. To securitize loans, we would likely create a wholly-owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We would then sell interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers and we would retain all or a portion of the equity in the subsidiary. Our primary use of funds is investments in our targeted asset classes and cash distributions to holders of our common stock.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, our plans to raise capital may not be successful. In this regard, because our common stock has at times traded at a price below our then-current net asset value per share (which has primarily been the case for the past year) and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital.\nIn addition, we intend to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income as dividends to our stockholders each taxable year in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code. See \"Regulated Investment Company Status and Distributions\" below. Consequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings. In addition, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value.\nAs a business development company, under the 1940 Act, we generally are not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 50% of the value of our assets). This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. We received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA, from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage ratio we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with this asset coverage requirement, as modified by our exemptive relief. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing. To fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future, we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources, including the equity markets and the securitization or other debt-related markets, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may from time to time be required to refinance previously issued debt securities upon their maturities. For example, we repaid in full our unsecured convertible notes on their maturity date of April 1, 2016. In order to fund this repayment, we utilized cash on hand and borrowings under our ING revolving credit facility.\nSignificant Capital Transactions\nThe following table reflects the distributions per

open market and distributed. \nOn November 30, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $100 million in the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock through November 30, 2016. During the year ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 7,004,139 shares of our common stock for $37.6 million, net of commissions.\nOn November 28, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $12.5 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock through November 28, 2017. Common stock repurchases under the program are to be made in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at times, and in such amounts, as we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including our performance, capital availability, general economic and market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by us. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nBorrowings\nSBIC Subsidiaries\nOn February 3, 2010, the Company's consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners IV, L.P., or FSMP IV, received a license, effective February 1, 2010, from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. On May 15, 2012, our consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners V, L.P., or FSMP V, received a license, effective May 10, 2012, from the SBA to operate as an SBIC. SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses.\nThe SBIC licenses allow the SBIC subsidiaries to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a 10-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities.\nSBA regulations currently limit the amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that an SBIC may issue to $150 million when it has at least $75 million in regulatory capital. Affiliated SBICs are permitted to issue up to a combined maximum amount of $350 million of debentures when they have at least $175 million in regulatory capital.\nAs of September 30, 2016, FSMP IV had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $138.3 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a fair value of $131.0 million. As of September 30, 2015, FSMP IV had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $150.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a fair value of $137.4 million. As of September 30, 2016, these debentures bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 3.625% (excluding the SBA annual charge), as follows:\nTable 304: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate Fix Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debenture\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed\nInterest\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SBA\nAnnual\nCharge\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.215\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.285\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of September 30, 2016 and 2015, FSMP V had $37.5 million in regulatory capital and $75.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a fair value of $67.5 million and $65.0 million, respectively.

SBA regulations also include restrictions on a \"change of control\" or transfer of an SBIC and require that SBICs invest idle funds in accordance with SBA regulations. In addition, the SBIC Subsidiaries may also be limited in their ability to make distributions to the Company if they do not have sufficient capital, in accordance with SBA regulations.\nThe SBIC subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. Receipt of an SBIC license does not assure that our SBIC subsidiaries will\nreceive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding and is further dependent upon our SBIC subsidiaries continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies.\nThe SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to our SBIC subsidiaries' assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate our SBIC subsidiaries or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by the SBIC subsidiaries upon an event of default.\nWe have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the Company's 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This allows us increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us, as of September 30, 2016, to borrow up to $213.3 million more than we would otherwise be able to under the 1940 Act absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.\nAs of September 30, 2016, except for assets that were funded through our SBIC subsidiaries and our investment in SLF JV I, substantially all of our assets were pledged as collateral under the ING facility or the Sumitomo facility.\nWe and our SBIC subsidiaries are also subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to our borrowings. For a discussion of such requirements, see \"Item 1. Business - Regulation - Business Development Company Regulations\" and \"- Small Business Investment Company Regulations\" in this Form 10-K.\nING Facility\nOn May 27, 2010, we entered into the ING facility pursuant to a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, or ING Credit Agreement, with certain lenders party thereto from time to time and ING Capital LLC, as administrative agent. The ING facility provides that we may use the proceeds and letters of credit under the facility for general corporate purposes, including acquiring and funding leveraged loans, mezzanine loans, high-yield securities, convertible securities, preferred stock, common stock and other investments. The ING facility allows us to request letters of credit from ING Capital LLC, as the issuing bank.\nAs of September 30, 2016, the ING facility permitted up to $710 million of borrowings with an accordion feature allowing for future expansion of the facility up to a total of $800 million, and borrowings under the facility bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (1-, 2-, 3- or 6-month, at our option) plus 2.25% per annum, with no LIBOR floor, assuming we maintain our current credit rating. Unless extended, the period during which we may make and reinvest borrowings under the facility will expire on August 6, 2017, and the maturity date of the facility is August 6, 2018.\nThe ING facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, as well as the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, FSFC Holdings, Inc., or Holdings, and our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Fund of Funds LLC, or Fund of Funds, subject to certain exclusions for, among other things, equity interests in our SBIC subsidiaries and equity interests in Funding II (as defined below) as set forth in a Guarantee, Pledge and Security Agreement, or the ING Security Agreement, entered into in connection with the ING Credit Agreement, among Holdings, ING Capital LLC, as collateral agent, and us. Fund of Funds and Holdings were formed to hold certain of our portfolio companies for tax purposes and have no other operations.\nPursuant to the ING Security Agreement, Holdings and Fund of Funds guaranteed the obligations under the ING Security Agreement, including our obligations to the lenders and the administrative agent under the ING Credit Agreement. Additionally, we pledged our entire equity interest in Holdings and Holdings pledged its entire equity interest in Fund of Funds to the collateral agent pursuant to the terms of the ING Security Agreement. None of our SBIC subsidiaries, Fifth Street Funding, LLC or Fifth Street Funding II, LLC is party to the ING facility and their respective assets have not been pledged in connection therewith.\nThe ING Credit Agreement and related agreements governing the ING facility required Holdings, Fund of Funds and us to, among other things, (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well as each of our portfolio companies' businesses, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) agree to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The ING facility documents also include usual and customary default provisions such as the failure to make timely payments under the facility, the occurrence of a change in control, and the failure by us to materially perform under the ING Credit Agreement and related agreements governing the facility, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility. Any such non-compliance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the ING facility.\nEach loan or letter of credit originated under the ING facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We cannot be assured that we will be able to borrow funds under the ING facility at any particular time or at all.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had $472.5 million of borrowings outstanding under the ING facility, which had a fair value of $472.5 million. Our borrowings under the ING facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 2.781% for the year ended September 30, 2016. For the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $15.1 million, $13.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively, related to the ING facility.\nSumitomo Facility\nOn September 16, 2011, Fifth Street Funding II, LLC, a consolidated wholly-owned bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiary, or Funding II, entered into a Loan and Servicing Agreement, or, as subsequently amended, the Sumitomo Agreement, with respect to the Sumitomo facility, with SMBC, an affiliate of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc., as administrative agent, and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto, in the amount of $200 million.\nAs of September 30, 2016, the Sumitomo facility permitted up to $125 million of borrowings (subject to collateral requirements), and borrowings under the facility bore interest at a rate of either (i) LIBOR (1-month) plus 2.00% per annum, with no LIBOR floor, if the borrowings under the Sumitomo facility are greater than 35% of the aggregate available borrowings under the Sumitomo facility or (ii) LIBOR (1-month) plus 2.25% per annum, if the borrowings under the Sumitomo Facility are less than or equal to 35% of the aggregate available borrowings under the Sumitomo facility. Unless extended, the period during which we may make and reinvest borrowings under the facility will expire on September 16, 2017, and the maturity date of the facility is September 16, 2021.\nIn connection with the Sumitomo facility, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Funding II, pursuant to which we will sell to Funding II certain loan assets we have originated or acquired, or will originate or acquire.\nThe Sumitomo Agreement and related agreements governing the Sumitomo facility required both Funding II and us to, among other things, (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well as each of our businesses, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) comply with various covenants, servicing procedures, limitations on acquiring and disposing of assets, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities, including a prepayment penalty in certain cases. The Sumitomo facility agreements also include usual and customary default provisions such as the failure to make timely payments under the facility, a change in control of Funding II, and the failure by Funding II or us to materially perform under the Sumitomo Agreement and related agreements governing the Sumitomo facility, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility. Any such non-compliance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Funding II was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the Sumitomo facility and has no other operations. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Sumitomo facility.\nThe Sumitomo facility is secured by all of the assets of Funding II. Each loan origination under the Sumitomo facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We cannot be assured that Funding II will be able to borrow funds under the Sumitomo facility at any particular time or at all.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had $43.8 million of borrowings outstanding under the Sumitomo facility, which had a fair value of $43.8 million. Our borrowings under the Sumitomo facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 2.432% for the year ended September 30, 2016. For the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $1.9 million, $1.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to the Sumitomo facility.\nThe Sumitomo facility does not require us to comply with significant financial covenants. The following table describes significant financial covenants with which we must comply under the ING facility on a quarterly basis:\nTable 306: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Covenant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Target Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reported Value (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net assets shall not be less than the greater of (a) 40% of total assets and (b) $825 million plus 50% of the aggregate net proceeds of all sales of equity interests after August 6, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$990 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,184 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Asset coverage ratio shall not be less than 2.10:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.10:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.19:1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest coverage ratio shall not be less than 2.50:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.50:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.04:1\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________\n(1) As contractually required, we report financial covenants based on the last filed quarterly or annual report, in this case our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.

Tannenbaum, our former Chief Executive Officer. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated April 12, 2011 or, the Indenture, between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, or the Trustee.\nThe Convertible Notes matured on April 1, 2016, or Maturity Date and we repaid in full the $115.0 million of outstanding Convertible Notes on the Maturity Date using cash on hand and borrowings under the ING facility.\nThe Convertible Notes bore interest at a rate of 5.375% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Convertible Notes were our unsecured obligations and ranked senior in right of payment to our indebtedness that was expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.\nOn or after January 1, 2016 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders could have converted their Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion, we would have been obligated to deliver shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate that was subject to periodic adjustment.\nWe could not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. No sinking fund was provided for the Convertible Notes. In addition, if certain corporate events occurred in respect to us, holders of the Convertible Notes could have required us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the required repurchase date.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $3.4 million, $6.8 million and $6.8 million related to the Convertible Notes.\n2019 Notes\nOn February 26, 2014, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% 2019 Notes for net proceeds of $244.4 million after deducting original issue discount of $1.4 million, underwriting commissions and discounts of $3.7 million and offering costs of $0.5 million. The original issue discount on these notes is amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the notes.\nThe 2019 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the supplemental indenture, dated February 26, 2014, or collectively, the 2019 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2019 Notes are our general unsecured obligations that rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated. The 2019 Notes effectively rank junior to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 2019 Notes rank structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.\nInterest on the 2019 Notes is paid semi-annually on March 1 and September 1, at a rate of 4.875% per annum. The 2019 Notes mature on March 1, 2019 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option prior to maturity.\nThe 2019 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2019 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2019 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2019 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, holders of the 2019 Notes can require us to repurchase the 2019 Notes at 100% of their principal amount upon the occurrence of certain change of control events as described in the 2019 Notes Indenture. The 2019 Notes were issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we did not repurchase any of the 2019 Notes in the open market.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $13.3 million, $13.4 million and $7.8 million, respectively, related to the 2019 Notes.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $250.0 million of 2019 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of $256.9 million.\n2024 Notes\nOn October 18, 2012, we issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% 2024 Notes for net proceeds of $72.5 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $2.2 million and offering costs of $0.3 million.\nThe 2024 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated October 18, 2012, or collectively, the 2024 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2024 Notes are our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.\nInterest on the 2024 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 at a rate of 5.875% per annum. The 2024 Notes mature on October 30, 2024 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after October 30, 2017. The 2024 Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol \"FSCE\" with a par value of $25.00 per note.\nThe 2024 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and with the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2024 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2024 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2024 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Any 2024 Notes repurchased by us may, at our option, be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, but may not be reissued or resold by us. Any 2024 Notes surrendered for cancellation will be promptly canceled and no longer outstanding under the 2024 Notes Indenture. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we did not repurchase any of the 2024 Notes in the open market.\nFor each of the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $4.6 million related to the 2024 Notes.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $75.0 million of 2024 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of $76.7 million.\n2028 Notes\nIn April and May 2013, we issued $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% 2028 Notes, for net proceeds of $83.4 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $2.6 million and offering costs of $0.3 million.\nThe 2028 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the second supplemental indenture, dated April 4, 2013, or collectively, the 2028 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2028 Notes are our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of\npayment to the 2028 Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.\nInterest on the 2028 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 at a rate of 6.125% per annum. The 2028 Notes mature on April 30, 2028 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after April 30, 2018. The 2028 Notes are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol \"FSCFL\" with a par value of $25.00 per note.\nThe 2028 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2028 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2028 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2028 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Any 2028 Notes repurchased by us may, at our option, be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, but may not be reissued or resold by us. Any 2028 Notes surrendered for cancellation will be promptly canceled and no longer outstanding under the 2028 Notes Indenture. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we did not repurchase any of the 2028 Notes in the open market.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $5.5 million related to the 2028 Notes.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $86.3 million 2028 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of $88.7 million.\nSecured Borrowings\nWe follow the guidance in ASC 860 when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. Such guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a \"participating interest,\" as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are carried at fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2016, secured borrowings at fair value totaled $18.4 million and the fair value of the loan that is associated with these secured borrowings was $52.1 million. These secured borrowings were the result of the completion of partial loan sales totaling $22.8 million of a senior secured debt investment during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 that did not meet the definition of a participating interest. As a result, sale treatment was not allowed and these partial loan sales were treated as secured borrowings. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, there were $2.9 million and $62.8 million of repayments on secured borrowings, respectively.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $1.5 million, $1.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, related to the secured borrowings.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $18.9 million of secured borrowings outstanding, which had a fair value of $18.4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2016, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $215.7 million of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of $191.7 million to provide debt financing to certain of our portfolio companies, $14.1 million to provide debt and equity financing to SLF JV I and $9.9 million related to unfunded limited partnership interests. As of September 30, 2015, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $305.3 million of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of $260.2 million to provide debt financing to certain of our portfolio companies, $30.7 million to provide debt and equity financing to SLF JV I and $14.4 million related to unfunded limited partnership interests. Such commitments are subject to our portfolio companies' satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. We believe that our assets will provide adequate cover to satisfy all of our unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2016.\nA summary of the composition of unfunded commitments (consisting of revolvers, term loans with delayed draw components, SLF JV I subordinated notes and LLC interests, and limited partnership interests) as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 is\nshown in the

Subchapter M of the Code. As long as we continue to qualify as a RIC, we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed as dividends, to stockholders on a timely basis.\nTaxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized. Distributions declared and paid by us in a taxable year may differ from taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of taxable income derived from the current taxable year or the distribution of taxable income derived from the prior taxable year carried forward into and distributed in the current taxable year. Distributions also may include returns of capital.\nTo maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute, with respect to each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company net taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any), determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. As a RIC, we are also subject to a federal excise tax, based on distribution requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis (e.g., calendar year 2014). We anticipate timely distribution of our taxable income in accordance with tax rules. We did not incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar years 2014 and 2015 and do not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for the calendar year 2016. We may incur a federal excise tax in future years.\nWe intend to distribute to our stockholders between 90% and 100% of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income). However, we are partially dependent on our SBIC subsidiaries for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirements. Our SBIC subsidiaries may be limited by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to enable us to maintain our status as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA's restrictions for our SBIC subsidiaries to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC status. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. Also, the covenants under the Sumitomo facility could, under certain circumstances, restrict Funding and Funding II from making distributions to us and, as a result, hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. Similarly, the covenants contained in the ING facility may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders, and, as a result, could hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal and taxable year fall below\nthe total amount of our dividend distributions for that fiscal and taxable year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our credit facilities and debt instruments. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our taxable income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.\nA RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to certain limitations regarding the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these guidelines.\nWe may generate qualified interest income that may be exempt from United States withholding tax on foreign accounts. A regulated RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified interest income and short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. The following table, which may be subject to change as we finalize our annual tax filings, lists the percentage of qualified interest income and qualified short-term capital gains for the three months ended December 31, 2015 March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016.\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Qualified Interest Income\n</td> <td>Qualified Short-Term Capital Gains\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCumulative qualified interest income for the year ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $85.0 million or 79.71% of total taxable distributions.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have entered into an investment advisory agreement with our Investment Adviser. Messrs. Berman, Dimitrov, Owens and Sandeep K. Khorana, each an interested member of our Board of Directors, have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in our Investment Adviser. The Investment Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, that is partially and indirectly owned by FSAM. As of September 30, 2016, fees payable to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the investment advisory agreement equaled (a) a base management fee of 1.75% of the value of our gross assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes and excludes cash and cash equivalents, and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and the fee for any partial month or quarter is appropriately prorated. The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals 20% of our \"Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income\" for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a preferred return, or \"hurdle,\" and a \"catch up\" feature. The catch-up\u201d provision is intended to provide our investment adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. The second part is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the investment advisory agreement) and equals 20% of our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fee. The investment advisory agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than 60 days' written notice to the other. During the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we incurred fees of $63.6 million, $80.2 million and $87.2 million, respectively, under the investment advisory agreement. While under no obligation to do so, for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Investment Adviser voluntarily and irrevocably waived a portion of the base management fee relating to partial loan sales that did not qualify for true sale accounting, which resulted a waiver of $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nPrior to December 31, 2015, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2% of our gross assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes but excludes any cash and cash equivalents held at the end of each quarter.\nOn January 20, 2016, we announced that our Investment Adviser has agreed to an amendment to the investment advisory agreement to permanently reduce the base management fee. Beginning January 1, 2016, the base management fee on total gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was reduced from 2% to 1.75%. The other commercial terms of our existing investment advisory arrangement with our Investment Adviser remained unchanged.\nOn July 14, 2015, we announced that our Investment Adviser voluntarily agreed to a revised base management fee arrangement, or the Revised Management Fee, for the period commencing on July 1, 2015 and remaining in effect until January 1, 2017, or the Waiver Period.\nThe Revised Management Fee is intended to provide for a reduction in the base management fee payable by us our Investment Adviser during the Waiver Period. Neither the prior waiver of base management fees nor the Revised Management Fee in any way implies that our Investment Adviser will agree to waive management or incentive fees in any future period. The Revised Management Fee will be calculated quarterly and will be equal to our gross assets, including assets acquired with borrowed funds, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by 0.25 multiplied by the sum of (x) and (y), expressed as a percentage, where (x) is equal to 2% multiplied by the Baseline NAV Percentage, and (y) is equal to 1% multiplied by the Incremental NAV Percentage. The \"Baseline NAV Percentage\" is the percentage derived by dividing our net asset value as of March 31, 2015 (i.e., $1,407,774,000), or the Baseline NAV, by the net asset value at the beginning of the fiscal quarter for which the fee is being calculated, or the New NAV. The Incremental NAV Percentage\u201d is the percentage derived by dividing the New NAV in excess of the Baseline NAV by the New NAV.\nThe Revised Management Fee modifies the base management fee payable to our Investment Adviser pursuant to our investment advisory agreement with our Investment Adviser and results in a blended annual base management fee rate that will not be less than 1%, or greater than 1.75%. The initial computation of the Revised Management Fee will occur at the end of the quarter following the quarter in which we issue or sell shares of our common stock, including new shares issued as dividends or pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan, but excluding non-ordinary course transactions as outlined below. Prior to that time, the annual base management fee rate will remain at 1.75%. Moreover, if any recalculation of the base management fee rate would otherwise result in an increase of the blended rate used, the blended rate in effect immediately prior to such recalculation would remain in effect until such time, if any, as a recalculation following an equity issuance would result in a lower fee rate.\nPursuant to the administration agreement with FSC CT, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of our investment adviser, FSC CT furnishes us with the facilities, including our principal executive offices, and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, including equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services at such facilities. In addition, FSC CT will assist us in connection with the determination and publishing of our net asset value, the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders. We pay FSC CT its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by FSC CT in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including a portion of the rent at market rates and the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than 60 days' written notice to the other. During the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we incurred expenses of $4.0 million, $6.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively, under the administration agreement.\nWe have also entered into a license agreement with Fifth Street Capital LLC pursuant to which Fifth Street Capital LLC has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name \"Fifth Street.\" Under this agreement, we will have a right to use the \"Fifth Street\" name, for so long as Fifth Street Management LLC or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we will have no legal right to the \"Fifth Street\" name. Fifth Street Capital LLC is controlled by Mr. Tannenbaum, our Investment Adviser's chief executive officer.\nAs of September 30, 2016, FSAM held 8,399,520 shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 5.9% of our common stock outstanding.\nRecent Developments\nOn October 18, 2016, our Board of Directors declared the following distributions:\n \u2022 $0.06 per share, payable on December 30, 2016 to stockholders of record on December 15, 2016; \n \u2022 $0.06 per share, payable on January 31, 2017 to stockholders of record on January 13, 2017; and \n \u2022 $0.06 per share, payable on February 28, 2017 to stockholders of record on February 15, 2017.  On November 28, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $12.5 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock through November 28, 2017. Common stock repurchases under the program are to be made in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at times, and in such amounts, as we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including our performance, capital availability, general economic and market conditions,\nregulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by us. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nFor a discussion of the developments in the litigation to which we are a party, see Part II - Other Information - Item 1.

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code, for tax purposes.\nWe generally lend to and invest in small and mid-sized companies, primarily in connection with investments by private equity sponsors. We define small and mid-sized companies as those with annual EBITDA between $10 million and $120 million. Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio's total return by generating current income from our debt investments, and to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from our equity investments.\nWe are externally managed by the Investment Adviser, a subsidiary of FSAM, a publicly traded alternative asset manager, pursuant to an investment advisory agreement. FSC CT, a subsidiary of the Investment Adviser, also provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for the fair presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements have been made. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We are an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies, or ASC 946.\nInvestment Valuation\nWe are required to report our investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The fair value is deemed to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nWe value our investments in accordance with FASB ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.\nHierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. \n \u2022 Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. \n \u2022 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. Generally, it is expected that all of our investment securities will be valued using Level 3 inputs. This includes investment securities that are valued using \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments are generally classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions.\nFinancial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, our Investment Adviser's capital markets group obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by independent pricing services for all of our senior secured debt investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing services use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations.\nOur Investment Adviser evaluates the prices obtained from independent pricing services based on available market information and company specific data that could affect the credit quality and/or fair value of the investment. Investments for which market quotations are readily available may be valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, our Investment Adviser looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Our Investment Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe any such market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. Examples of these events could include cases when a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale or in the event of a \"fire sale\" by a distressed seller. In these instances, we value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available (as discussed below).\nIf the quotation provided by the pricing service is based on only one or two market sources, we perform additional procedures to corroborate such information, which may include the bond yield approach discussed below and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit quality and market trends affecting the portfolio company.\nWe perform detailed valuations of our debt and equity investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are deemed not to represent fair value of the investments. We typically use two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value, or EV, of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA. EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. We may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is typically performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other alternative methods such as an asset liquidation model, expected recovery model or a recent observable or pending transaction may be utilized to estimate EV. The second valuation technique is a bond yield approach, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. To determine fair value using a bond yield approach, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the bond yield approach, we consider the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, we depend on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.\nWe estimate the fair value of privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions including, but not limited to, the current stock price (by analyzing the portfolio company's operating performance and financial condition and general market conditions), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nOur Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments:\n \u2022 The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by our Investment Adviser's valuation team in conjunction with the Investment Adviser's portfolio management and capital markets teams;  \u2022Preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with principals of our Investment Adviser;\n \u2022 Separately, independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors prepare valuations of our investments, on a selected basis, for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment, and submit the reports to us and provide such reports to our Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors; \n \u2022 The Investment Adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors; \n \u2022 The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuations with the portfolio managers of the Investment Adviser and our Investment Adviser responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between our Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee; \n \u2022 The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors makes a recommendation to our Board of Directors regarding the fair value of the investments in our portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available; and \n \u2022 Our Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available in good faith.  The fair value of our investments at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has authorized the engagement of independent valuation firms to provide valuation assistance. We will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter. As of September 30, 2016, 89.8% of our portfolio at fair value was valued by independent valuation firms. The percentage of our portfolio valued by independent valuation firms may vary from period to period based on the\navailability of market quotations for our portfolio investments during the respective periods. However, our Board of Directors is ultimately and solely responsible for the valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nThe percentages of our portfolio, at fair value, valued by independent valuation firms as of the end of each period during the current and two preceding fiscal years were as follows:\n\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, approximately 92.0% and 92.9%, respectively, of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies valued at prices equal to fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest income, adjusted for accretion of original issue discount, or OID, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. In connection with our investment, we sometimes receive nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the particular portfolio company. When we receive nominal cost equity, we allocate our cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. Distributions of income from portfolio companies are generally recorded as dividend income on the ex-dividend date.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were five investments on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.\nFee Income\nWe receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of business, including servicing, advisory, amendment, structuring and prepayment fees, which are classified as fee income and recognized as they are earned.\nWe have also structured exit fees across certain of our portfolio investments to be received upon the future exit of those investments. Exit fees are payable upon the exit of a debt security. These fees are to be paid to us upon the sooner to occur of (i) a sale of the borrower or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, (ii) the maturity date of the loan or (iii) the date when full prepayment of the loan occurs. The receipt of such fees is contingent upon the occurrence of one of the events listed above for each of the investments. A percentage of these fees is included in net investment income over the life of the loan. As of September 30, 2016, we had structured $2.8 million in aggregate exit fees across three portfolio investments upon the future exit of those investments.\nPIK Interest\nOur loans may contain contractual PIK interest provisions. The PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We generally cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. Our decision to cease accruing PIK interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; our assessment of the portfolio company's business development success, including product development, profitability and the portfolio company's overall adherence to its\nbusiness plan; information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. Based on this and other information, we determine whether to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security when it is determined that PIK interest is no longer collectible. Our determination to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security is generally made well before our full write-down of such loan or debt security. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements and, as a result, increases the cost basis of these investments for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser.\nFor a discussion of risks we are subject to as a result of our use of PIK interest in connection with our investments, see \"Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure - We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we are required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes before or without receiving cash representing such income,\" \"- We may in the future choose to pay distributions partly in our own stock, in which case you may be subject to tax in excess of the cash you receive\" and \"- Our incentive fee may induce our Investment Adviser to make speculative investments\" in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments both in our Consolidated Financial Statements and for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser.\nTo maintain our status as a RIC, PIK income must be paid out to our stockholders as distributions, even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never collect the cash relating to the PIK interest. Accumulated PIK interest was $62.6 million, or 2.9%, of the fair value of our portfolio of investments as of September 30, 2016 and $50.7 million, or 2.1%, as of September 30, 2015. The net increases in loan balances as a result of contractual PIK arrangements are separately identified in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nPortfolio Composition\nOur investments principally consist of loans, purchased equity investments and equity grants in privately-held companies and SLF JV I. Our loans are typically secured by a first, second or subordinated lien on the assets of the portfolio company and generally have terms of up to seven years (but an expected average life of between three and four years). We are currently focusing our origination efforts on a prudent mix of senior secured and subordinated loans which we believe will provide attractive risk-adjusted returns while maintaining adequate credit protection. The mix may change over time based on market conditions and management's view of where the best risk- adjusted returns are available.\nA summary of the composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total investments is shown in the following tables:\n\n\nThe industry composition of our portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total investments was as follows:\n\n\nPortfolio Asset Quality\nWe employ a ranking system to assess and monitor the credit risk of our investment portfolio. We rank all investments on a scale from 1 to 4. The system is intended to reflect the performance of the borrower's business, the collateral coverage of the loan, and other factors considered relevant to making a credit judgment. We have determined that there should be an individual ranking assigned to each tranche of securities in the same portfolio company where appropriate. This may arise when the perceived risk of loss on the investment varies significantly between tranches due to their respective seniority in the capital structure.\n \u2022 Investment Ranking 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations and/or capital gains are expected. \n \u2022 Investment Ranking 2 is used for investments that are performing substantially within our expectations, and whose risks \nremain materially consistent with the potential risks at the time of the original or restructured investment. All new investments are initially ranked 2.\n \u2022 Investment Ranking 3 is used for investments that are performing below our expectations and for which risk has materially increased since the original or restructured investment. The portfolio company may be out of compliance with debt covenants and may require closer monitoring. To the extent that the underlying agreement has a PIK interest provision, investments with a ranking of 3 are generally those on which we are not accruing PIK interest. \n \u2022 Investment Ranking 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below our expectations and for which risk has increased substantially since the original or restructured investment. Investments with a ranking of 4 are those for which some loss of principal is expected and are generally those on which we are not accruing cash interest.  The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 4 investment ranking scale at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:\n\n__________________\n (1) Due to operating performance this ratio is not measurable and, as a result, is excluded from the total portfolio calculation.  We may from time to time modify the payment terms of our investments, either in response to current economic conditions and their impact on certain of our portfolio companies or in accordance with tier pricing provisions in certain loan agreements. As of September 30, 2016, we had modified the payment terms of our investments in 16 portfolio companies. Such modified terms may include increased PIK interest provisions and reduced cash interest rates. These modifications, and any future modifications to our loan agreements, may limit the amount of interest income that we recognize from the modified investments, which may, in turn, limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nLoans and Debt Securities on Non-Accrual Status\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were five investments on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income. As of September 30, 2015, there were four investments on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income. As of September 30, 2014, there was one investment on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.\nThe percentages of our debt investments at cost and fair value by accrual status as of September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 were as follows:\n\n___________________\n (1) PIK non-accrual status is inclusive of other non-cash income, where applicable. Cash non-accrual status is inclusive of PIK and other non-cash income, where applicable. \nThe non-accrual status of our portfolio investments as of September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 was as follows:\n\n__________________\n (1) PIK non-accrual status is inclusive of other non-cash income, where applicable. Cash non-accrual status is inclusive of PIK and other non-cash income, where applicable. \n (2) In October 2014, we restructured our investment in Miche Bag, LLC. As part of the restructuring, we received debt and equity securities in the restructured entity, Miche Group, LLC, which we no longer hold at September 30, 2016. \n (3) We no longer hold this investment at September 30, 2016 \n (4) In March 2016, we restructured our investment in CCCG, LLC. As part of the restructuring, we exchanged cash and our debt securities for debt and equity securities in a newly restructured entity, Express Group Holdings LLC. \nIncome non-accrual amounts for the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 are presented in the following table. Income non-accrual amounts may include amounts for investments that were no longer held at the end of the period.\n\nSenior Loan Fund JV I, LLC\nIn May 2014, we entered into a limited liability company, or LLC, agreement with Kemper to form SLF JV I. On July 1, 2014, SLF JV I began investing in senior secured loans of middle market companies and other corporate debt securities. We co-invest in these securities with Kemper through our investment in SLF JV I. SLF JV I is managed by a four person board of directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by Kemper. SLF JV I is capitalized pro rata with subordinated notes and LLC equity interests as transactions are completed. The subordinated notes mature on May 2, 2021. All portfolio decisions and investment decisions in respect of SLF JV I must be approved by the SLF JV I investment committee, which consists of one representative from us and one representative of Kemper (with approval from a representative of each required). As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we and Kemper owned, in the aggregate, 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of each of the outstanding subordinated notes and LLC equity interests.\nSLF JV I has a $200.0 million Deutsche Bank facility with a maturity date of July 1, 2019. Borrowings under the Deutsche Bank facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum. $100.0 million and $188.6 million was outstanding under this facility as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.\nSLF JV I also has a $200.0 million Credit Suisse facility, bringing SLF JV I's total debt capacity to $400.0 million. The Credit Suisse facility has a maturity date of July 7, 2023 and borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum. $67.0 million and $53.0 million was outstanding under this facility as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.\nBorrowings under the Deutsche Bank facility and Credit Suisse facility are secured by all of the assets of the respective special purpose financing vehicles of SLF JV I.\nWe have determined that SLF JV I is an investment company under ASC 946, however, in accordance with such guidance, we will generally not consolidate our investment in a company other than a wholly-owned investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to us. Accordingly, we do not consolidate our noncontrolling interest in SLF JV I.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, SLF JV I had total assets of $338.5 million and $419.0 million, respectively. Our investment in SLF JV I consisted of LLC equity interests of $13.7 million and subordinated notes of $129.0 million, at fair value as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2015, our investment consisted of LLC equity interests of $12.2 million and subordinated notes of $128.9 million, at fair value. The subordinated notes are junior in right of payment to the repayment of temporary contributions made by us to fund investments of SLF JV I that are repaid when Kemper makes its capital contributions. SLF JV I's portfolio consisted of middle market and other corporate debt securities of 37 and 34 \"eligible portfolio companies\" (as defined in the Section 2(a)(46) of the 1940 Act) as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The portfolio companies in SLF JV I are in industries similar to those in which we may invest directly.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, SLF JV I had total capital commitments of $200.0 million, $175.0 million of which was from us and the remaining $25.0 million from Kemper.

We recognized a $0.5 million realized loss on these transactions.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results and Operations\nOut-of-Period Adjustments\nWe previously identified accounting errors from fiscal years ended 2012 through 2015 related to revenue recognition and consolidation. The revenue recognition errors were the result of certain fees which were historically recognized on the deal closing date, but should have been amortized over the life of the loan since the fees did not represent a separately identifiable revenue contract. These errors were partially offset by the overpayment of Part I Incentive Fees paid to the Investment Adviser. There were also errors resulting from not historically consolidating wholly-owned holding companies that should have been consolidated (First Star holding companies). We assessed the materiality of the errors on our prior quarterly and annual financial statements, assessing materiality both quantitatively and qualitatively, in accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 99 and SAB 108 and concluded that the errors were not material to any of the previously issued financial statements. However, we recorded a cumulative out-of-period adjustment for the three months ended December 31, 2014 to correct these errors prior to October 1, 2014. These errors did not impact the financial information for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the out-of-period adjustment.\nResults of Operations\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees, and other investment income and total expenses. Net realized gain (loss) on investments and secured borrowings is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and secured borrowings and their stated costs. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio and secured borrowings during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation (depreciation) when gains or losses are realized.\nComparison of Years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015\nTotal Investment Income\nTotal investment income includes interest on our investments, fee income and other investment income. Fee income consists of the monthly servicing fees, advisory fees, structuring fees, exit fees and prepayment fees that we receive in connection with our debt investments. These fees are recognized as earned. Other investment income consists primarily of dividend income received from certain of our equity investments.\nTotal investment income for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $247.9 million and $265.5 million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2016, this amount primarily consisted of $211.2 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $14.0 million of PIK interest) and $22.7 million of fee income. For the year ended September 30, 2015, this amount primarily consisted of $229.3 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $13.4 million of PIK interest) and $22.3 million of fee income.\nTotal investment income for the year ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2015, decreased primarily due to lower interest income from a decrease in the size of our investment portfolio and additional investments on which we stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.\nExpenses\nNet expenses (expenses net of base management fee waivers and insurance recoveries) for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $141.1 million and $150.5 million, respectively. Net expenses decreased for the years ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the years ended September 30, 2015, by $9.4 million, or 6.2%, due primarily to a $9.9 million decrease in base management fees, which was attributable to the permanent fee reduction that we agreed to with our investment adviser effective January 1, 2016, a $6.5 million decrease in Part I incentive fees, which was attributable to lower pre-incentive fee net investment income for the year-over-year period, and a $2.0 million decrease in interest expense, which was attributable to the repayment of our convertible notes on April 1, 2016, partially offset by a $9.9 million increase in professional fees related to litigation and proxy-related matters.\nNet Investment Income\nAs a result of the $17.6 million decrease in total investment income and the $9.4 million decrease in net expenses, net investment income for the year ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $8.2 million, or 7.1%, compared to the year ended September 30, 2015.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Secured Borrowings\nRealized gain (loss) is the difference between the net proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and secured borrowings and their stated costs. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, we recorded investment realization events, including the following:\n \u2022 In October 2015, we received a cash payment of $23.3 million from Affordable Care, Inc. in full satisfaction of all obligations under the loan agreement.

This consisted of $91.2 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments and $0.2 million of net unrealized depreciation on equity investments, offset by $19.7 million of net reclassifications to realized losses (resulting in unrealized appreciation) and $0.7 million of net unrealized depreciation on secured borrowings.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2014, we recorded net unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings of $32.2 million. This consisted of $31.9 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments, $0.1 million of net unrealized appreciation on secured borrowings and $3.4 million of net reclassifications to realized gains (resulting in unrealized depreciation), partially offset by $3.1 million of net unrealized appreciation on equity investments.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nWe have a number of alternatives available to fund our investment portfolio and our operations, including raising equity, increasing debt and funding from operational cash flow. Additionally, to generate liquidity we may reduce investment size by syndicating a portion of any given transaction. We intend to fund our future distribution obligations through operating cash flow or with funds obtained through future equity and debt offerings or credit facilities, as we deem appropriate.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $20.5 million. During that period, we received $164.8 million of net cash from operating activities, primarily from $818.2 million of principal payments, PIK payments and sale proceeds received and the cash activities related to $106.7 million of net investment income, partially offset by funding $735.5 million of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, net cash used by financing activities was $185.2 million, primarily consisting of $100.3 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders, $37.6 million of repurchases of common stock under stock repurchase program, $11.7 million of repayments of SBA debentures payable, $6.4 million of repurchases of common stock under our DRIP and $2.9 million of repayments of secured borrowings, partially offset by $89.0 million of net borrowings under our credit facilities (including borrowings to repay the $115.0 million Convertible Notes at maturity).\nFor the year ended September 30, 2015, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $51.6 million. During that period, we received $146.2 million of net cash from operating activities, primarily from $1.4 billion of principal payments, PIK\npayments and sale proceeds received and cash activities related to $114.9 million of net investment income, partially offset by funding $1.4 billion of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, net cash used by financing activities was $94.5 million, primarily consisting of $114.7 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders, $62.8 million of repayments of secured borrowings, $20.0 million of repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program (including treasury shares) and $6.0 million of repurchases of common stock under our DRIP, partially offset by $109.9 million of net borrowings under our credit facilities.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had $130.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (including $12.4 million of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $2.2 billion, $15.6 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $213.3 million of SBA debentures payable, $516.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, $410.6 million of unsecured notes payable, $18.4 million of secured borrowings and unfunded commitments of $215.7 million.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we had $143.5 million in cash and cash equivalents (including $5.1 million of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $2.4 billion, $15.7 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $225.0 million of SBA debentures payable, $427.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, $115.0 million of unsecured convertible notes payable, $410.3 million of unsecured notes payable, $21.2 million of secured borrowings and unfunded commitments of $305.3 million.\nOther Sources of Liquidity\nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, including interest earned, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time issue securities pursuant to a shelf registration statement or otherwise pursuant to private offerings. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful. In the future, we may also securitize a portion of our investments in first and second lien senior loans or unsecured debt or other assets. To securitize loans, we would likely create a wholly-owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We would then sell interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers and we would retain all or a portion of the equity in the subsidiary. Our primary use of funds is investments in our targeted asset classes and cash distributions to holders of our common stock.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, our plans to raise capital may not be successful. In this regard, because our common stock has at times traded at a price below our then-current net asset value per share (which has primarily been the case for the past year) and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital.\nIn addition, we intend to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income as dividends to our stockholders each taxable year in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code. See \"Regulated Investment Company Status and Distributions\" below. Consequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings. In addition, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value.\nAs a business development company, under the 1940 Act, we generally are not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 50% of the value of our assets). This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. We received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA, from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage ratio we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with this asset coverage requirement, as modified by our exemptive relief. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing. To fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future, we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources, including the equity markets and the securitization or other debt-related markets, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may from time to time be required to refinance previously issued debt securities upon their maturities. For example, we repaid in full our unsecured convertible notes on their maturity date of April 1, 2016. In order to fund this repayment, we utilized cash on hand and borrowings under our ING revolving credit facility.\nSignificant Capital Transactions\nThe following table reflects the distributions per share that our Board of Directors has declared, including shares issued under our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, on our common stock since October 1, 2014:\n\n______________\n (1) Shares were purchased on the open market and distributed. \nOn November 30, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $100 million in the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock through November 30, 2016. During the year ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 7,004,139 shares of our common stock for $37.6 million, net of commissions.\nOn November 28, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $12.5 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock through November 28, 2017. Common stock repurchases under the program are to be made in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at times, and in such amounts, as we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including our performance, capital availability, general economic and market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by us. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nBorrowings\nSBIC Subsidiaries\nOn February 3, 2010, the Company's consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners IV, L.P., or FSMP IV, received a license, effective February 1, 2010, from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. On May 15, 2012, our consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners V, L.P., or FSMP V, received a license, effective May 10, 2012, from the SBA to operate as an SBIC. SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses.\nThe SBIC licenses allow the SBIC subsidiaries to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a 10-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities.\nSBA regulations currently limit the amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that an SBIC may issue to $150 million when it has at least $75 million in regulatory capital. Affiliated SBICs are permitted to issue up to a combined maximum amount of $350 million of debentures when they have at least $175 million in regulatory capital.\nAs of September 30, 2016, FSMP IV had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $138.3 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a fair value of $131.0 million. As of September 30, 2015, FSMP IV had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $150.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a fair value of $137.4 million. As of September 30, 2016, these debentures bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 3.625% (excluding the SBA annual charge), as follows:\n\nAs of September 30, 2016 and 2015, FSMP V had $37.5 million in regulatory capital and $75.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a fair value of $67.5 million and $65.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2015, these debentures bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 2.835% (excluding the SBA annual charge), as follows:\n\nAs of September 30, 2016, the $213.3 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures held by the SBIC Subsidiaries carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.348% (excluding the SBA annual charge).\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded aggregate interest expense of $9.5 million, $9.3 million and $8.6 million, respectively, related to the SBA-guaranteed debentures of the SBIC subsidiaries.\nThe SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to repurchase their capital stock. SBA regulations also include restrictions on a \"change of control\" or transfer of an SBIC and require that SBICs invest idle funds in accordance with SBA regulations. In addition, the SBIC Subsidiaries may also be limited in their ability to make distributions to the Company if they do not have sufficient capital, in accordance with SBA regulations.\nThe SBIC subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. Receipt of an SBIC license does not assure that our SBIC subsidiaries will\nreceive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding and is further dependent upon our SBIC subsidiaries continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies.\nThe SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to our SBIC subsidiaries' assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate our SBIC subsidiaries or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by the SBIC subsidiaries upon an event of default.\nWe have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the Company's 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This allows us increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us, as of September 30, 2016, to borrow up to $213.3 million more than we would otherwise be able to under the 1940 Act absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.\nAs of September 30, 2016, except for assets that were funded through our SBIC subsidiaries and our investment in SLF JV I, substantially all of our assets were pledged as collateral under the ING facility or the Sumitomo facility.\nWe and our SBIC subsidiaries are also subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to our borrowings. For a discussion of such requirements, see \"Item 1. Business - Regulation - Business Development Company Regulations\" and \"- Small Business Investment Company Regulations\" in this Form 10-K.\nING Facility\nOn May 27, 2010, we entered into the ING facility pursuant to a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, or ING Credit Agreement, with certain lenders party thereto from time to time and ING Capital LLC, as administrative agent. The ING facility provides that we may use the proceeds and letters of credit under the facility for general corporate purposes, including acquiring and funding leveraged loans, mezzanine loans, high-yield securities, convertible securities, preferred stock, common stock and other investments. The ING facility allows us to request letters of credit from ING Capital LLC, as the issuing bank.\nAs of September 30, 2016, the ING facility permitted up to $710 million of borrowings with an accordion feature allowing for future expansion of the facility up to a total of $800 million, and borrowings under the facility bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (1-, 2-, 3- or 6-month, at our option) plus 2.25% per annum, with no LIBOR floor, assuming we maintain our current credit rating. Unless extended, the period during which we may make and reinvest borrowings under the facility will expire on August 6, 2017, and the maturity date of the facility is August 6, 2018.\nThe ING facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, as well as the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, FSFC Holdings, Inc., or Holdings, and our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Fund of Funds LLC, or Fund of Funds, subject to certain exclusions for, among other things, equity interests in our SBIC subsidiaries and equity interests in Funding II (as defined below) as set forth in a Guarantee, Pledge and Security Agreement, or the ING Security Agreement, entered into in connection with the ING Credit Agreement, among Holdings, ING Capital LLC, as collateral agent, and us. Fund of Funds and Holdings were formed to hold certain of our portfolio companies for tax purposes and have no other operations.\nPursuant to the ING Security Agreement, Holdings and Fund of Funds guaranteed the obligations under the ING Security Agreement, including our obligations to the lenders and the administrative agent under the ING Credit Agreement. Additionally, we pledged our entire equity interest in Holdings and Holdings pledged its entire equity interest in Fund of Funds to the collateral agent pursuant to the terms of the ING Security Agreement. None of our SBIC subsidiaries, Fifth Street Funding, LLC or Fifth Street Funding II, LLC is party to the ING facility and their respective assets have not been pledged in connection therewith.\nThe ING Credit Agreement and related agreements governing the ING facility required Holdings, Fund of Funds and us to, among other things, (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well as each of our portfolio companies' businesses, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) agree to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The ING facility documents also include usual and customary default provisions such as the failure to make timely payments under the facility, the occurrence of a change in control, and the failure by us to materially perform under the ING Credit Agreement and related agreements governing the facility, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility. Any such non-compliance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the ING facility.\nEach loan or letter of credit originated under the ING facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We cannot be assured that we will be able to borrow funds under the ING facility at any particular time or at all.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had $472.5 million of borrowings outstanding under the ING facility, which had a fair value of $472.5 million. Our borrowings under the ING facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 2.781% for the year ended September 30, 2016. For the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $15.1 million, $13.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively, related to the ING facility.\nSumitomo Facility\nOn September 16, 2011, Fifth Street Funding II, LLC, a consolidated wholly-owned bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiary, or Funding II, entered into a Loan and Servicing Agreement, or, as subsequently amended, the Sumitomo Agreement, with respect to the Sumitomo facility, with SMBC, an affiliate of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc., as administrative agent, and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto, in the amount of $200 million.\nAs of September 30, 2016, the Sumitomo facility permitted up to $125 million of borrowings (subject to collateral requirements), and borrowings under the facility bore interest at a rate of either (i) LIBOR (1-month) plus 2.00% per annum, with no LIBOR floor, if the borrowings under the Sumitomo facility are greater than 35% of the aggregate available borrowings under the Sumitomo facility or (ii) LIBOR (1-month) plus 2.25% per annum, if the borrowings under the Sumitomo Facility are less than or equal to 35% of the aggregate available borrowings under the Sumitomo facility. Unless extended, the period during which we may make and reinvest borrowings under the facility will expire on September 16, 2017, and the maturity date of the facility is September 16, 2021.\nIn connection with the Sumitomo facility, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Funding II, pursuant to which we will sell to Funding II certain loan assets we have originated or acquired, or will originate or acquire.\nThe Sumitomo Agreement and related agreements governing the Sumitomo facility required both Funding II and us to, among other things, (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well as each of our businesses, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) comply with various covenants, servicing procedures, limitations on acquiring and disposing of assets, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities, including a prepayment penalty in certain cases. The Sumitomo facility agreements also include usual and customary default provisions such as the failure to make timely payments under the facility, a change in control of Funding II, and the failure by Funding II or us to materially perform under the Sumitomo Agreement and related agreements governing the Sumitomo facility, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility. Any such non-compliance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Funding II was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the Sumitomo facility and has no other operations. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Sumitomo facility.\nThe Sumitomo facility is secured by all of the assets of Funding II. Each loan origination under the Sumitomo facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We cannot be assured that Funding II will be able to borrow funds under the Sumitomo facility at any particular time or at all.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had $43.8 million of borrowings outstanding under the Sumitomo facility, which had a fair value of $43.8 million. Our borrowings under the Sumitomo facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 2.432% for the year ended September 30, 2016. For the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $1.9 million, $1.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to the Sumitomo facility.\nThe Sumitomo facility does not require us to comply with significant financial covenants. The following table describes significant financial covenants with which we must comply under the ING facility on a quarterly basis:\n\n___________\n(1) As contractually required, we report financial covenants based on the last filed quarterly or annual report, in this case our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. We were also in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities based on the financial information contained in this Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2016.\nThe following table reflects material credit facility and SBA debenture transactions that have occurred since October 1, 2014 (amounts available are as of September 30, 2016):\n\n_______________\n (1) Availability to increase upon our decision to further collateralize the facility \n (2) Weighted average interest rate of locked debentures (excludes the SBA annual charge) \n (3) 1-month \n (4) 1-, 2-, 3- or 6-month LIBOR, at our option \n (5) LIBOR +2.0% when the facility is drawn more than 35%. Otherwise, LIBOR +2.25%  Convertible Notes\nOn April 12, 2011, we issued $152 million of convertible notes, or the Convertible Notes, including $2 million issued to Leonard M. Tannenbaum, our former Chief Executive Officer. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated April 12, 2011 or, the Indenture, between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, or the Trustee.\nThe Convertible Notes matured on April 1, 2016, or Maturity Date and we repaid in full the $115.0 million of outstanding Convertible Notes on the Maturity Date using cash on hand and borrowings under the ING facility.\nThe Convertible Notes bore interest at a rate of 5.375% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Convertible Notes were our unsecured obligations and ranked senior in right of payment to our indebtedness that was expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.\nOn or after January 1, 2016 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders could have converted their Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion, we would have been obligated to deliver shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate that was subject to periodic adjustment.\nWe could not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. No sinking fund was provided for the Convertible Notes. In addition, if certain corporate events occurred in respect to us, holders of the Convertible Notes could have required us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the required repurchase date.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $3.4 million, $6.8 million and $6.8 million related to the Convertible Notes.\n2019 Notes\nOn February 26, 2014, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% 2019 Notes for net proceeds of $244.4 million after deducting original issue discount of $1.4 million, underwriting commissions and discounts of $3.7 million and offering costs of $0.5 million. The original issue discount on these notes is amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the notes.\nThe 2019 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the supplemental indenture, dated February 26, 2014, or collectively, the 2019 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2019 Notes are our general unsecured obligations that rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated. The 2019 Notes effectively rank junior to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 2019 Notes rank structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.\nInterest on the 2019 Notes is paid semi-annually on March 1 and September 1, at a rate of 4.875% per annum. The 2019 Notes mature on March 1, 2019 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option prior to maturity.\nThe 2019 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2019 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2019 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2019 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, holders of the 2019 Notes can require us to repurchase the 2019 Notes at 100% of their principal amount upon the occurrence of certain change of control events as described in the 2019 Notes Indenture. The 2019 Notes were issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we did not repurchase any of the 2019 Notes in the open market.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $13.3 million, $13.4 million and $7.8 million, respectively, related to the 2019 Notes.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $250.0 million of 2019 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of $256.9 million.\n2024 Notes\nOn October 18, 2012, we issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% 2024 Notes for net proceeds of $72.5 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $2.2 million and offering costs of $0.3 million.\nThe 2024 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated October 18, 2012, or collectively, the 2024 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2024 Notes are our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.\nInterest on the 2024 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 at a rate of 5.875% per annum. The 2024 Notes mature on October 30, 2024 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after October 30, 2017. The 2024 Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol \"FSCE\" with a par value of $25.00 per note.\nThe 2024 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and with the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2024 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2024 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2024 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Any 2024 Notes repurchased by us may, at our option, be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, but may not be reissued or resold by us. Any 2024 Notes surrendered for cancellation will be promptly canceled and no longer outstanding under the 2024 Notes Indenture. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we did not repurchase any of the 2024 Notes in the open market.\nFor each of the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $4.6 million related to the 2024 Notes.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $75.0 million of 2024 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of $76.7 million.\n2028 Notes\nIn April and May 2013, we issued $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% 2028 Notes, for net proceeds of $83.4 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $2.6 million and offering costs of $0.3 million.\nThe 2028 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the second supplemental indenture, dated April 4, 2013, or collectively, the 2028 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2028 Notes are our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of\npayment to the 2028 Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.\nInterest on the 2028 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 at a rate of 6.125% per annum. The 2028 Notes mature on April 30, 2028 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after April 30, 2018. The 2028 Notes are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol \"FSCFL\" with a par value of $25.00 per note.\nThe 2028 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2028 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2028 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2028 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Any 2028 Notes repurchased by us may, at our option, be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, but may not be reissued or resold by us. Any 2028 Notes surrendered for cancellation will be promptly canceled and no longer outstanding under the 2028 Notes Indenture. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we did not repurchase any of the 2028 Notes in the open market.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $5.5 million related to the 2028 Notes.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $86.3 million 2028 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of $88.7 million.\nSecured Borrowings\nWe follow the guidance in ASC 860 when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. Such guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a \"participating interest,\" as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are carried at fair value.\nAs of September 30, 2016, secured borrowings at fair value totaled $18.4 million and the fair value of the loan that is associated with these secured borrowings was $52.1 million. These secured borrowings were the result of the completion of partial loan sales totaling $22.8 million of a senior secured debt investment during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 that did not meet the definition of a participating interest. As a result, sale treatment was not allowed and these partial loan sales were treated as secured borrowings. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, there were $2.9 million and $62.8 million of repayments on secured borrowings, respectively.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we recorded interest expense of $1.5 million, $1.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, related to the secured borrowings.\nAs of September 30, 2016, there were $18.9 million of secured borrowings outstanding, which had a fair value of $18.4 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2016, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $215.7 million of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of $191.7 million to provide debt financing to certain of our portfolio companies, $14.1 million to provide debt and equity financing to SLF JV I and $9.9 million related to unfunded limited partnership interests. As of September 30, 2015, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $305.3 million of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of $260.2 million to provide debt financing to certain of our portfolio companies, $30.7 million to provide debt and equity financing to SLF JV I and $14.4 million related to unfunded limited partnership interests. Such commitments are subject to our portfolio companies' satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. We believe that our assets will provide adequate cover to satisfy all of our unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2016.\nA summary of the composition of unfunded commitments (consisting of revolvers, term loans with delayed draw components, SLF JV I subordinated notes and LLC interests, and limited partnership interests) as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 is\nshown in the table below: \n\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table reflects information pertaining to our debt outstanding under the SBA debentures, the ING facility, the Sumitomo facility, our Convertible Notes, our 2019 Notes, our 2024 Notes, our 2028 Notes and our secured borrowings:\n\nThe following table reflects our contractual obligations arising from the SBA debentures, the ING facility, the Sumitomo facility, our secured borrowings, our 2019 Notes, our 2024 Notes and our 2028 Notes:\n\nRegulated Investment Company Status and Distributions\nWe elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As long as we continue to qualify as a RIC, we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed as dividends, to stockholders on a timely basis.\nTaxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized. Distributions declared and paid by us in a taxable year may differ from taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of taxable income derived from the current taxable year or the distribution of taxable income derived from the prior taxable year carried forward into and distributed in the current taxable year. Distributions also may include returns of capital.\nTo maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute, with respect to each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company net taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any), determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. As a RIC, we are also subject to a federal excise tax, based on distribution requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis (e.g., calendar year 2014). We anticipate timely distribution of our taxable income in accordance with tax rules. We did not incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar years 2014 and 2015 and do not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for the calendar year 2016. We may incur a federal excise tax in future years.\nWe intend to distribute to our stockholders between 90% and 100% of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income). However, we are partially dependent on our SBIC subsidiaries for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirements. Our SBIC subsidiaries may be limited by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to enable us to maintain our status as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA's restrictions for our SBIC subsidiaries to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC status. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. Also, the covenants under the Sumitomo facility could, under certain circumstances, restrict Funding and Funding II from making distributions to us and, as a result, hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. Similarly, the covenants contained in the ING facility may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders, and, as a result, could hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal and taxable year fall below\nthe total amount of our dividend distributions for that fiscal and taxable year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our credit facilities and debt instruments. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our taxable income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.\nA RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to certain limitations regarding the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these guidelines.\nWe may generate qualified interest income that may be exempt from United States withholding tax on foreign accounts. A regulated RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified interest income and short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. The following table, which may be subject to change as we finalize our annual tax filings, lists the percentage of qualified interest income and qualified short-term capital gains for the three months ended December 31, 2015 March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016.\n\nCumulative qualified interest income for the year ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $85.0 million or 79.71% of total taxable distributions.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have entered into an investment advisory agreement with our Investment Adviser. Messrs. Berman, Dimitrov, Owens and Sandeep K. Khorana, each an interested member of our Board of Directors, have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in our Investment Adviser. The Investment Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, that is partially and indirectly owned by FSAM. As of September 30, 2016, fees payable to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the investment advisory agreement equaled (a) a base management fee of 1.75% of the value of our gross assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes and excludes cash and cash equivalents, and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and the fee for any partial month or quarter is appropriately prorated. The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals 20% of our \"Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income\" for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a preferred return, or \"hurdle,\" and a \"catch up\" feature. The catch-up\u201d provision is intended to provide our investment adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. The second part is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the investment advisory agreement) and equals 20% of our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fee. The investment advisory agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than 60 days' written notice to the other. During the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we incurred fees of $63.6 million, $80.2 million and $87.2 million, respectively, under the investment advisory agreement. While under no obligation to do so, for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Investment Adviser voluntarily and irrevocably waived a portion of the base management fee relating to partial loan sales that did not qualify for true sale accounting, which resulted a waiver of $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nPrior to December 31, 2015, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2% of our gross assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes but excludes any cash and cash equivalents held at the end of each quarter.\nOn January 20, 2016, we announced that our Investment Adviser has agreed to an amendment to the investment advisory agreement to permanently reduce the base management fee. Beginning January 1, 2016, the base management fee on total gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was reduced from 2% to 1.75%. The other commercial terms of our existing investment advisory arrangement with our Investment Adviser remained unchanged.\nOn July 14, 2015, we announced that our Investment Adviser voluntarily agreed to a revised base management fee arrangement, or the Revised Management Fee, for the period commencing on July 1, 2015 and remaining in effect until January 1, 2017, or the Waiver Period.\nThe Revised Management Fee is intended to provide for a reduction in the base management fee payable by us our Investment Adviser during the Waiver Period. Neither the prior waiver of base management fees nor the Revised Management Fee in any way implies that our Investment Adviser will agree to waive management or incentive fees in any future period. The Revised Management Fee will be calculated quarterly and will be equal to our gross assets, including assets acquired with borrowed funds, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by 0.25 multiplied by the sum of (x) and (y), expressed as a percentage, where (x) is equal to 2% multiplied by the Baseline NAV Percentage, and (y) is equal to 1% multiplied by the Incremental NAV Percentage. The \"Baseline NAV Percentage\" is the percentage derived by dividing our net asset value as of March 31, 2015 (i.e., $1,407,774,000), or the Baseline NAV, by the net asset value at the beginning of the fiscal quarter for which the fee is being calculated, or the New NAV. The Incremental NAV Percentage\u201d is the percentage derived by dividing the New NAV in excess of the Baseline NAV by the New NAV.\nThe Revised Management Fee modifies the base management fee payable to our Investment Adviser pursuant to our investment advisory agreement with our Investment Adviser and results in a blended annual base management fee rate that will not be less than 1%, or greater than 1.75%. The initial computation of the Revised Management Fee will occur at the end of the quarter following the quarter in which we issue or sell shares of our common stock, including new shares issued as dividends or pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan, but excluding non-ordinary course transactions as outlined below. Prior to that time, the annual base management fee rate will remain at 1.75%. Moreover, if any recalculation of the base management fee rate would otherwise result in an increase of the blended rate used, the blended rate in effect immediately prior to such recalculation would remain in effect until such time, if any, as a recalculation following an equity issuance would result in a lower fee rate.\nPursuant to the administration agreement with FSC CT, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of our investment adviser, FSC CT furnishes us with the facilities, including our principal executive offices, and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, including equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services at such facilities. In addition, FSC CT will assist us in connection with the determination and publishing of our net asset value, the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders. We pay FSC CT its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by FSC CT in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including a portion of the rent at market rates and the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than 60 days' written notice to the other. During the years ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we incurred expenses of $4.0 million, $6.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively, under the administration agreement.\nWe have also entered into a license agreement with Fifth Street Capital LLC pursuant to which Fifth Street Capital LLC has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name \"Fifth Street.\" Under this agreement, we will have a right to use the \"Fifth Street\" name, for so long as Fifth Street Management LLC or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser.

Operations (MD&A) section of an annual financial report (Form 10-K) for Fifth Street Finance Corp. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and covers various financial aspects of the company for the periods ending September 30, 2016, and 2015.\n\nKey points discussed in the report include:\n\n1. **Forward-Looking Statements**: The report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ due to various factors which are broadly classified into changes in economic, financial markets, and political environment; disruptions caused by terrorism or natural disasters; changes in regulations and conditions in the operating areas, especially affecting business development companies (BDCs), small business investment companies (SBICs), and regulated investment companies (RICs); and outcomes of litigation.\n\n2. **Financial Overview**: Fifth Street Finance Corp is a specialty finance company operating as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company, electing to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and qualified to be treated as a RIC for tax purposes. It invests in small and mid-sized companies, generating returns through current income from debt investments and capital appreciation from equity investments, managed by an external advisor.\n\n3. **Critical Accounting Policies**: Financial statements have been prepared following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and consider fair value measurement disclosures as significant, requiring management judgment and estimation.\n\n4. **Investment Valuation Process**: Investments are reported at fair value, determined quarterly by the Board of Directors with the assistance of independent valuation firms for investments without readily available market values, using techniques such as enterprise value calculations, discounted cash flow analysis, and, where appropriate, other methods such as comparable transactions, asset liquidation, or market quotations.\n\n5. **Results of Operations**: The report discusses the company's performance in terms of net investment income, realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments, and the impact on net asset value. For the years ending September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, there was a focus on a decrease in total investment income, changes to expenses, and fluctuations in realized and unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments.\n\n6. **Fund Sources, Liquidity, and Capital Resources**: The company outlines its cash flow sources, including operations, future borrowings, and equity offerings.
