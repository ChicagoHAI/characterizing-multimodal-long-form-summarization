Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results together with the section captioned Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a life sciences company dedicated to improving life through the application of our pioneering, proprietary ARCUS genome editing platform. We leverage ARCUS in the development of our product candidates, which are designed to treat human diseases and create healthy and sustainable food and agricultural solutions. We are actively developing product candidates in three innovative areas: allogeneic CAR T cell immunotherapy, in vivo gene correction, and food. We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory, or R/R, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, or R/R B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or B-ALL. PBCAR0191 is our first gene-edited allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, T cell therapy candidate targeting CD19 and is being developed in collaboration with Les Laboratoires Servier, or Servier. We have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR0191 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of ALL. Made from donor-derived T cells modified using our ARCUS genome editing technology, PBCAR0191 recognizes the well characterized tumor cell surface protein CD19, an important and validated target in several B-cell cancers, and is designed to avoid graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD, a significant complication associated with donor-derived, cell-based therapies. We believe that this trial, which is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of PBCAR0191 at increasing dose levels, as well as to evaluate anti-tumor activity, is the first U.S.-based clinical trial to evaluate an allogeneic CAR T therapy for R/R NHL. Furthermore, we believe that our proprietary, one-step engineering process for producing allogeneic CAR T cells with a potentially optimized cell phenotype, at large scale in a cost-effective manner, will enable us to overcome the fundamental clinical and manufacturing challenges that have limited the CAR T field to date.\nIn December 2019, we announced initial data from this ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with R/R NHL and R/R B-ALL. A total of nine adult patients were reported in these initial Phase 1 trial results, including six with NHL (three treated at Dose Level 1 (3x105 cells/kg), or DL1, and three treated at Dose Level 2 (1x106 cells/kg), or DL2), and three with B-ALL (all treated at DL2). These data indicated no serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities. In the NHL cohort, four of six patients demonstrated an objective tumor response by Lugano criteria at day 28, for an overall objective response rate of 67%, including three partial responses and one complete response. In the ALL cohort, one of three patients achieved a complete response at day 28 following treatment with PBCAR0191. As of December 31, 2019, dosing of patients at Dose Level 3 (3x106 cells/kg) was underway. Based on the data observed at DL1 and DL2, we filed a protocol amendment for this trial with the FDA in December 2019. The amended trial design is intended to specifically address key clinical questions. These include assessing the impact of higher total doses of cells on clinical activity and/or the impact of modified lymphodepletion on the ability to achieve durable clinical benefit with associated CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Following feedback from the FDA in late January 2020, the protocol amendment is now being implemented.\nIn September 2019, the FDA accepted our investigational new drug, or IND, application for our second allogeneic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR20A, for which we expect to commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in the first quarter of 2020. PBCAR20A is wholly owned by us and targets the validated tumor cell surface target CD20. It will be investigated in subjects with NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL. A subset of the NHL patients will have the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, and we have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR20A from the FDA for the treatment of this disease. Based on the adverse events observed to date with PBCAR0191, the FDA has agreed to allow us to commence dosing with PBCAR20A directly at Dose Level 2, which we expect to accelerate the timing for our expected completion of the trial.\nIn January 2020, the FDA accepted our IND application for our third allogeneic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR269A, for which we expect to commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in 2020. PBCAR269A is wholly owned by us and is designed to target the validated tumor cell surface target BCMA. It will be investigated in subjects with R/R multiple myeloma and we have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for this indication.\nAlso in January 2020, we announced that we expect to advance a program targeting the rare genetic disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1, or PH1 as our lead wholly owned in vivo gene correction program. PH1 affects approximately 1-3 people per million in the United States and is caused by loss of function mutations in the AGXT gene, leading to the accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys. Patients suffer from painful kidney stones which may ultimately lead to renal failure. Using ARCUS, we are developing a potential therapeutic approach to the treatment of PH1 that involves knocking out a gene called HAO1 which acts upstream of AGXT. Suppressing HAO1 has been shown in preclinical models by us to prevent the formation of calcium oxalate. We therefore believe that a one-time administration of an ARCUS nuclease targeting HAO1 may be a viable strategy for a durable treatment of PH1 patients. In preclinical studies we have demonstrated in a mouse model of PH1 that administration of an ARCUS nuclease targeting HAO1 resulted in approximately 70% reduction in urine calcium oxalate levels. We have also demonstrated that ARCUS efficiently knocked out the HAO1 gene in non-human primates. We plan to select a clinical candidate for this program during 2020.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we opened our Manufacturing Center for Advanced Therapeutics, or MCAT, which we believe is the first in-house current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facility dedicated to genome-edited, off-the-shelf CAR T cell therapy product candidates in the United States. MCAT will enable in-house production of three different drug substances: allogeneic CAR T cells, messenger RNA (including formulations development) and adeno-associated viral vectors. We are currently using this new manufacturing center to create clinical trial material to be used in our BCMA targeting allogeneic CAR T clinical trials beginning in 2020. We believe MCAT confers a number of strategic advantages including cost benefits, control of our manufacturing process and strategic flexibility as we execute our clinical trials. In the longer term, we believe MCAT has the potential to be a commercial launch facility.\nSince our formation in 2006, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing ARCUS, conducting research and development activities, recruiting skilled personnel, developing manufacturing processes, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our IPO, the sale of our convertible preferred stock and upfront payments from licensing arrangements.\nOn April 1, 2019, we completed our IPO of 9,085,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 1,185,000 additional shares of common stock, at an offering price of $16.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $130.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. To date, we have generated approximately $475.4 million from third parties through a combination of financings including through our IPO, preferred stock and convertible note financings, an upfront payment under the Servier Agreement and additional funding from other strategic alliances and grants.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and have not generated any revenue from the sale of products. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. Our net losses were $92.9 million and $46.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $177.1 million.\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase substantially in connection with the expansion of our product development programs and capabilities. We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public equity, debt financings or other sources, which may include current and new collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will ever generate significant revenue to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of therapeutic and agricultural products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be required to raise additional capital on terms that are unfavorable to us or we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nWe currently conduct our operations through two reportable segments: Therapeutics and Food. Our Therapeutics segment is focused on allogeneic CAR T immunotherapy and in vivo gene correction. Our Food segment focuses on applying ARCUS to develop food and nutrition products through collaboration agreements with consumer-facing companies.\nCollaborations\nGilead\nIn September 2018, we and Gilead entered into a collaboration and license agreement, which we refer to as the Gilead Agreement, to develop genome editing tools using ARCUS to target viral DNA associated with the Hepatitis B virus. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Gilead received an exclusive license to exploit the resulting synthetic nucleases and products that use them to treat the Hepatitis B virus in humans, and we are entitled to receive up to approximately $40.0 million in research funding over an initial three year term and milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $445.0 million, consisting of up to $105.0 million in development milestone payments and up to $340.0 million in commercial milestone payments. We are also entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the high single digit percentages to the mid-teen percentages on worldwide net sales of the products developed through the term of the agreement, subject to customary potential reductions.\nWe recognized $13.3 million and $3.7 million in revenues under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and recorded $1.5 million and $2.3 million in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. We did not receive any milestone payments under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.\nServier\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement, pursuant to which we have agreed to develop allogeneic CAR T cell therapies for up to six unique antigen targets. One target was selected at the agreement's inception. Upon selection of an antigen target under the agreement, we have agreed to perform early-stage research and development on individual T cell modifications for the selected target, develop the resulting therapeutic product candidates through Phase 1 clinical trials and prepare clinical trial material of such product candidates for use in Phase 2 clinical trials.\nWe received an upfront payment of $105.0 million under the Servier Agreement. We have the ability to receive total payments, including the upfront payment, option fees and milestone payments, in the aggregate across all six targets, of up to approximately $1.6 billion. This includes up to $1.5 billion in milestone payments, consisting of up to $401.3 million in development milestone payments and up to $1.1 billion in commercial milestone payments. We are also entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digit percentages to the sub-teen percentages on worldwide net sales, subject to potential customary reductions. We also have the right to participate in the development and commercialization of any licensed products resulting from the collaboration through a 50/50 co-development and co-promotion option in the United States, subject to our payment of an option fee, which is exercisable after Servier's commercial option exercise.\nUnder the Servier Agreement, we recognized $7.3 million and $5.8 million in revenues during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The amount recorded as deferred revenue was $80.9 million and $88.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. No development or sales-based milestones were received for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales in the foreseeable future. We record revenue from collaboration agreements, including amounts related to upfront payments, annual fees for licenses of our intellectual property and research and development funding.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates. These include the following:\nTable 336: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> salaries, benefits and other related costs, including share-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third parties that conduct preclinical research and development activities and clinical trials on our behalf;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and ongoing and future clinical trials, including the costs of contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and our MCAT facility that will manufacture our clinical trial material for use in our preclinical studies and ongoing and potential future clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of outside consultants, including their fees and related travel expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> license payments made for intellectual property used in research and development activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs if specifically identifiable to research activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We track external research and development costs, including the costs of laboratory supplies and services, outsourced research and development, clinical trials, contract manufacturing, laboratory equipment and maintenance and certain other development costs, by product candidate when the program IND application is accepted by the FDA. Internal and external costs associated with infrastructure resources, other research and development costs, facility related costs and depreciation and amortization that are not identifiable to a specific product candidate are included in the platform development, early-stage research and unallocated expenses category in the table below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program for the periods presented:\nTable 343: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and development expenses by product candidate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CD19 external development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,928\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CD20 external development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BCMA external development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Platform development, early-stage research and unallocated expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Laboratory supplies and services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outsourced research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CMOs and research organizations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Laboratory equipment and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licensing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other research and development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (937\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase substantially for the foreseeable future and will comprise a larger percentage of our total expenses as we continue our Phase 1/2a clinical trial for our CD19 product candidate, commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for our CD20 product candidate, commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for our BCMA product candidate, and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of ongoing and future clinical trials of our CD19, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, or any other product candidate we may develop or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our CD19, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, and any other our product candidate we may develop will depend on a variety of factors, including:\nTable 344: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of clinical trials of our CD19, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, as well as of any future clinical trials of other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 345: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the actual probability of success for our product candidates, including their safety and efficacy, early clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 349: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to slower than expected patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, business development, operations and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs that are not specifically attributable to research activities.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our personnel headcount to support our continued research activities and development of product candidates. We also expect to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements; director and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs.\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\nWe elected on issuance to account for the convertible notes payable we issued in March 2019, or the 2019 Notes, at fair value until their settlement. The change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was recognized through the statement of operations. The 2019 Notes settled into 2,921,461 shares of common stock on the closing of our IPO on April 1, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception in 2006, we have generated cumulative federal and state net operating loss and R&D credit carryforwards for which we have not recorded any net tax benefit due to the uncertainty around utilizing these tax attributes within their respective carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2019, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $101.3 million, $101.7 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income. The U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $19.7 million will begin to expire in 2030 while the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards of $81.6 million carry forward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2025. As of December 31, 2019, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $7.2 million, which begin to expire in 2027. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had federal Orphan Drug credits of $1.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2038. As of December 31, 2019, we also have federal contribution carryforwards of $0.1 million, which begin to expire in 2020. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into United States law. The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal tax rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). The federal tax rate change resulted in a reduction in the gross amount of our deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2017, and a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance. As a result, no income tax expense or benefit was recognized as of the enactment date of the TCJA.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, together with the changes in those items in dollars:\nTable 350: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87,204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,912\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39,292\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of convertible note payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,758\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,758\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (182\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (182\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,673\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,548\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (92,877\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (46,037\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (46,840\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $22.2 million, compared to $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The increase of $37.3 million was primarily due to a $31.9 million increase in platform development, early-stage research and unallocated expenses, a $9.4 million and $4.9 million increase in direct research and development expenses related to our CD20 and BCMA programs, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in direct research and development expenses related to our CD19 program of $8.9 million.\nThe increase in direct research and development expenses for our CD20 and BCMA programs was due to increases in lab services and CMO and research organization costs as we prepare to enter planned Phase 1/2a clinical trials in 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in our CD19 expenses primarily due to lower spending on CMO and research organization costs.\nPlatform development, early-stage research and unallocated expenses increased primarily due to a $11.6 million increase in employee-related costs associated with increased headcount to support our technology platform development and manufacturing capabilities, a $7.6 million increase in laboratory supplies and services, a $5.4 million increase in outsourced research and development spending and $2.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $13.3 million was primarily due to an increase of $6.2 million in employee-related costs as we increased our general and administrative headcount, $2.7 million in consulting fees, $2.1 million in increased administrative costs, including insurance, franchise and property taxes, bank fees, and costs related to operating as a public company, and $1.4 million in facility related costs.\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\nWe elected on issuance to account for the 2019 Notes at fair value until their settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $9.8 million of expense as changes in fair value. The 2019 Notes were settled on the closing of the IPO in April 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $2.4 million of interest income generated on our cash and cash equivalent balances was the result of lower interest rates and having higher cash balances invested in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSegment Results\nThe following tables summarize segment revenues and segment operating loss (see Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our segments):\nTable 352: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operational cash expenditures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment operational cash expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allocation of centralized research and development operational\ncash expenditures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total allocation of centralized research and development\noperational cash expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (49,427\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (37,127\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,378\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,666\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (54,805\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (47,793\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe evaluate the operating performance of each segment based on segment operating loss. Segment operating loss is derived by deducting operational cash expenditures, net, from GAAP revenue. Operational cash expenditures are cash disbursements made that are specifically identifiable to the reportable segment (including specifically identifiable research and development and property, equipment and software expenditures). For the year ended December 31, 2018, we allocated centralized research and development expenditures for early stage research, nuclease development and the purchase of general laboratory supplies to the Therapeutics and Food segments based on headcount. In January 2019, the Food segment moved into a new leased facility in Durham, North Carolina. We have determined that the Food segment is no longer deriving benefit from the Company's centralized research and development expenditures, thus all these expenditures were allocated to the Therapeutics segment for the year ended December 31, 2019. The reportable segment and centralized research and development operational cash expenditures include cash disbursements for compensation, laboratory supplies, purchases of property, equipment and software and procuring services from CROs, CMOs and research organizations. We do not allocate general operational expenses or non-cash income statement amounts to our reportable segments.\nTherapeutics Segment\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $20.6 million, compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $11.1 million was primarily the result of a $9.6 million increase in research funding from Gilead and $1.5 million increase in revenue from Servier. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $45.9 million, compared to $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $10.9 million in operational cash expenditures was primarily due to an increase in payments made to service providers for contract manufacturing and clinical trial research, laboratory supplies and services, employee headcount and fixed assets for the build out of our manufacturing capabilities, offset by a decrease in payments made to the University of Pennsylvania, which is early stage research and not considered specific to any one therapeutic area. As a result, these payments were classified as centralized research and development expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2019 as opposed to being classified as Therapeutics operational cash expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2018. Segment operating loss increased $12.3 million from $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the factors discussed above.\nFood Segment\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.6 million, compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $0.2 million was primarily attributable to $0.4 million from a new customer agreement with a collaboration partner entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019 offset by a $0.2 million decrease in revenue from a collaboration partner. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $7.0 million, compared to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $2.1 million was primarily due to a decrease in leasehold improvements, which is attributable to large construction expenditures made in the year ended December 31, 2018 for work done to our leased facility that did not occur in the year ended December 31, 2019, as our Food segment moved into the facility in January 2019. This decrease in spending was offset by increases in laboratory equipment, furniture and fixtures, laboratory supplies, employee headcount and rent. Segment operating loss decreased $5.3 million from $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the factors discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will continue to increase, including in connection with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, contracting with CROs and CMOs, the addition of laboratory equipment to MCAT in support of preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources. We do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales.\nWe have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our IPO, the sale of our convertible preferred stock and upfront payments from collaboration and licensing arrangements. On April 1, 2019, we completed our IPO of 9,085,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 1,185,000 additional shares of common stock, at an offering price of $16.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $130.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. To date, we have generated approximately $475.4 million from third parties through a combination of financings including through our IPO, preferred stock and convertible note financings, an upfront payment under the Servier Agreement and additional funding from other strategic alliances and grants.\nIn May 2019, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the Pacific Western Loan Agreement\u201d) with PWB pursuant to which we may request advances on a revolving line of credit of up to an aggregate principal of $50.0 million (the Revolving Line\u201d). The Pacific Western Loan Agreement was amended (the PWB Amendment\u201d) in December 2019 to allow the Company to maintain a bank account with a non-affiliated bank in the United Kingdom provided that the account balance does not exceed 1.5 million GBP or its U.S. dollar equivalent at any time. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our Revolving Line and were in compliance with its financial covenants.\nCash Flows\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $180.9 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $103.2 million as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the periods presented:\nTable 353: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (71,015\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (51,723\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,666\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,663\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows for the Year ended December 31, 2019\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $71.0 million, driven primarily by our net loss of $92.9 million as we incurred expenses associated with our CD19, CD20, and BCMA programs, platform development and early-stage research, and general and administrative expenses, and a decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $2.4 million, partially offset by net non-cash expenses of $24.2 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $24.7 million, which was attributable to purchases of property, equipment and software.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $173.4 million, consisting of $130.5 million in proceeds from our IPO, net of issuance costs, the net proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 Notes of $39.6 million, and $1.3 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.\nDebt Obligations\nIn March 2019, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $39.6 million of 2019 Notes in a private placement transaction. Upon settlement, the change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was $9.8 million and the accrued interest on the 2019 Notes was $0.2 million. Pursuant to their terms, the 2019 Notes were settled in 2,921,461 shares of our common stock upon the closing of our IPO at a settlement price of $13.60 per share, which is equal to 85% of the IPO price per share.\nIn May 2019, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Pacific Western Bank pursuant to which we may request advances on a $50.0 million revolving line of credit.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $51.7 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $46.0 million as we incurred expenses associated with our CD19 program, platform development and early-stage research and general and administrative expenses. In addition, we had non-cash charges of $4.8 million for depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense. Net cash used in operating activities was also impacted by $10.5 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities, including $7.5 million in prepaid expenses, $3.2 million in deferred revenue, $0.5 million in accounts receivable, $0.7 million in accounts payable and $0.4 million in other current assets and other assets, which were partially offset by changes of $1.8 million in accrued expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $15.7 million, which was attributable to purchases of property, equipment and software of $14.3 million and the acquisition of intellectual property of $1.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $107.8 million, consisting of the net proceeds from the issuance of our Series B convertible preferred stock financing of $109.7 million, net of offering costs, and $0.2 million in proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by $2.1 million in payments for deferred offering costs associated with our initial public offering.\nLoan and Security Agreement\nIn May 2019, we entered into the Pacific Western Loan Agreement pursuant to which we may request advances on a $50.0 million Revolving Line. The maturity date of the Revolving Line is May 15, 2022. The Revolving Line bears interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 1.25% below the prime rate then in effect, or (ii) 4.25% at all times when we maintain a daily balance of cash in our demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million, and the greater of (i) 0.25% above the prime rate then in effect; or (ii) 5.75% at all times when we do not maintain a daily balance of cash in demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million; provided that, we are permitted to maintain a bank account with a non-affiliated bank in the United Kingdom so long as the account balance does not exceed 1.5 million GBP or its U.S. dollar equivalent at any time, pursuant to the PWB Amendment. We are required to pay a fee in an amount equal to 0.50% per annum of the unused portion of the Revolving Line each quarter, or the Unused Fee. The Unused Fee shall be waived for any quarter in which we maintain a daily balance of cash in our demand deposit account at PWB of at least $25.0 million at all times during such quarter. If the Revolving Line is terminated prior to the maturity date, we are required to pay an early termination fee equal to 1.0% of the Revolving Line.\nUnder the terms of the Pacific Western Loan Agreement, we granted PWB a security interest in substantially all of our assets, excluding any of the intellectual property now or hereafter owned, (but including any rights to payment from the sale or licensing of any such intellectual property). We must maintain an aggregate balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand at PWB (or PWB's affiliates) at least equal to any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line and any other outstanding obligations the we have to PWB. The agreement was amended in December 2019 to allow a bank account with a non-affiliated bank in the United Kingdom provided that the account balance does not exceed 1.5 million GBP or its U.S. dollar equivalent at any time.\nThe Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants (affirmative and negative), and includes standard events of default, including in the event of a material adverse change. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, PWB may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as are set forth in the loan and security agreement and increase the interest rate otherwise applicable to the amount outstanding under the Revolving Line by an additional 3.00%.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our Revolving Line, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants, under the Pacific Western Loan Agreement.\nFunding Requirements\nOur operating expenses increased substantially in 2019 and are expected to increase substantially in the future in connection with the initiation of additional human clinical trials and capital expenditures for MCAT.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2021. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical and agricultural products, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 354: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress, costs and results of our clinical development for our CD19, CD20, and BCMA programs as we initiate and progress clinical trials, including CRO costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 355: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress, costs and results of our additional research and preclinical development programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 356: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 357: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of internal process development and manufacturing scale-up activities and contract with CMOs associated with our CD19, CD20, and BCMA programs and other programs we advance through preclinical and clinical development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 358: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 359: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, results and costs of any product candidates that we may derive from ARCUS or any other product candidates we may develop alone or with collaborators;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 360: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 361: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 362: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings, collaboration agreements, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and/or distribution arrangements.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, shareholders' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, product development and research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 363: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total(2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Lease Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 364: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents future minimum lease payments under our operating leases for office and/or lab space at the following locations: 302 East Pettigrew Street, Durham, North Carolina expiring in July 2024, 3054 Cornwallis Road, Durham, North Carolina expiring in April 2026 and 20 TW Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina expiring in August 2027 (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these lease agreements).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 365: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> We have entered into a license agreement with an undisclosed licensee for intellectual property used in our research programs.

As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our Revolving Line. The maturity date of the Revolving Line is May 15, 2022. The Revolving Line bears interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 1.25% below the prime rate then in effect, or (ii) 4.25% at all times when we maintain a daily balance of cash in our demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million, and the greater of (i) 0.25% above the prime rate then in effect; or (ii) 5.75% at all times when we do not maintain a daily balance of cash in demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million.

The unused fee shall be waived for any quarter we maintain a daily balance in our demand deposit accounts of at least $25.0 million. If the Revolving Line is terminated prior to the maturity date, we are required to pay an early termination fee equal to 1.0% of the Revolving Line.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we have entered into the Duke License, under which we are obligated to make aggregate future milestone payments of up to $0.2 million upon the achievement of specified corporate milestones as well as low-single digit percent royalty payments based on future net sales of applicable products and generally mid-teen percent royalties based on sublicensing revenue. See Business-License and Collaboration Agreements\u201d for more information regarding our payment obligations under the Duke License. We have not included future payments under the Duke License in the table above since the payment obligations under the Duke License are contingent upon future events, such as the achievement of specified milestones or generating product sales, and we are unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales.\nWe also enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs, universities and other third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the table above as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research, license, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales. We classify payments received under these agreements as revenues within our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605\u201d). ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nAt contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we evaluate the performance obligations promised in the contract that are based on goods and services that will be transferred to the customer and determine whether those obligations are both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the contract. Goods or services that meet these criteria are considered distinct performance obligations. If both these criteria are not met, the goods and services are combined into a single performance obligation. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and, if so, these options are considered performance obligations. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nWe recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time this is based on the use of an output or input method.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue within current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue - noncurrent. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet received or invoiced are generally recognized as contract assets in the Other line item in our consolidated balance sheets.\nMilestone Payments - If an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nRoyalties - For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor relationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\nSignificant Financing Component - In determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assessed each of our revenue arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nCollaborative Arrangements - We have entered into collaboration agreements, which are within the scope of ASC 606, to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple promises or obligations, which may include: (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaboration partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASU No. 2018-18 Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, are within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement for the licensing of our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform and the research, development, and manufacturing of product for clinical trials and commercialization of products. In September 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Gilead, which we refer to as the Gilead Agreement, to develop genome editing tools using our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform. Both agreements use our genome editing technology for the treatment of certain diseases. Consideration we received, or may receive, under these collaboration and license agreements include upfront nonrefundable payments, research funding payments and payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales.\nUnder the guidance of ASC 606, certain judgments affect revenue recognition. Our primary performance obligations under our agreements consist of research and development services. Measuring the amount of time it takes for us to complete these services includes estimating our total effort to satisfy our performance obligations at the outset of the agreement and then comparing that amount to the actual effort expended for a given accounting period. In certain instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the timing of satisfying these obligations and timing may change due to efforts beyond our control, such as changes in the customer's direction of a particular research program or changes to the contractual terms of an agreement. Accordingly, our estimates may change in the future. Such changes to estimates will result in a change in prospective revenue recognition amounts.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to the following:\nTable 367: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> CROs and other third parties in connection with performing research and development activities, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 368: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 369: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> CMOs and other vendors in connection with product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical supplies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials and CMOs that manufacture product for our research and development activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may cause us to report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other share-based awards granted to our employees, directors, consultants and advisors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards, net of actual forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. As we have limited trading history, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded share price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing a weighted value considering actual history and estimated expected term based on the midpoint of final vest date and expiration date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. The JOBS Act also exempts us from having to provide an auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b).\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results together with the section captioned Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a life sciences company dedicated to improving life through the application of our pioneering, proprietary ARCUS genome editing platform. We leverage ARCUS in the development of our product candidates, which are designed to treat human diseases and create healthy and sustainable food and agricultural solutions. We are actively developing product candidates in three innovative areas: allogeneic CAR T cell immunotherapy, in vivo gene correction, and food. We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory, or R/R, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, or R/R B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or B-ALL. PBCAR0191 is our first gene-edited allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, T cell therapy candidate targeting CD19 and is being developed in collaboration with Les Laboratoires Servier, or Servier. We have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR0191 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of ALL. Made from donor-derived T cells modified using our ARCUS genome editing technology, PBCAR0191 recognizes the well characterized tumor cell surface protein CD19, an important and validated target in several B-cell cancers, and is designed to avoid graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD, a significant complication associated with donor-derived, cell-based therapies. We believe that this trial, which is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of PBCAR0191 at increasing dose levels, as well as to evaluate anti-tumor activity, is the first U.S.-based clinical trial to evaluate an allogeneic CAR T therapy for R/R NHL. Furthermore, we believe that our proprietary, one-step engineering process for producing allogeneic CAR T cells with a potentially optimized cell phenotype, at large scale in a cost-effective manner, will enable us to overcome the fundamental clinical and manufacturing challenges that have limited the CAR T field to date.\nIn December 2019, we announced initial data from this ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with R/R NHL and R/R B-ALL. A total of nine adult patients were reported in these initial Phase 1 trial results, including six with NHL (three treated at Dose Level 1 (3x105 cells/kg), or DL1, and three treated at Dose Level 2 (1x106 cells/kg), or DL2), and three with B-ALL (all treated at DL2). These data indicated no serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities. In the NHL cohort, four of six patients demonstrated an objective tumor response by Lugano criteria at day 28, for an overall objective response rate of 67%, including three partial responses and one complete response. In the ALL cohort, one of three patients achieved a complete response at day 28 following treatment with PBCAR0191. As of December 31, 2019, dosing of patients at Dose Level 3 (3x106 cells/kg) was underway. Based on the data observed at DL1 and DL2, we filed a protocol amendment for this trial with the FDA in December 2019. The amended trial design is intended to specifically address key clinical questions. These include assessing the impact of higher total doses of cells on clinical activity and/or the impact of modified lymphodepletion on the ability to achieve durable clinical benefit with associated CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Following feedback from the FDA in late January 2020, the protocol amendment is now being implemented.\nIn September 2019, the FDA accepted our investigational new drug, or IND, application for our second allogeneic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR20A, for which we expect to commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in the first quarter of 2020. PBCAR20A is wholly owned by us and targets the validated tumor cell surface target CD20. It will be investigated in subjects with NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL. A subset of the NHL patients will have the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, and we have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR20A from the FDA for the treatment of this disease. Based on the adverse events observed to date with PBCAR0191, the FDA has agreed to allow us to commence dosing with PBCAR20A directly at Dose Level 2, which we expect to accelerate the timing for our expected completion of the trial.\nIn January 2020, the FDA accepted our IND application for our third allogeneic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR269A, for which we expect to commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in 2020. PBCAR269A is wholly owned by us and is designed to target the validated tumor cell surface target BCMA. It will be investigated in subjects with R/R multiple myeloma and we have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for this indication.\nAlso in January 2020, we announced that we expect to advance a program targeting the rare genetic disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1, or PH1 as our lead wholly owned in vivo gene correction program. PH1 affects approximately 1-3 people per million in the United States and is caused by loss of function mutations in the AGXT gene, leading to the accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys. Patients suffer from painful kidney stones which may ultimately lead to renal failure. Using ARCUS, we are developing a potential therapeutic approach to the treatment of PH1 that involves knocking out a gene called HAO1 which acts upstream of AGXT. Suppressing HAO1 has been shown in preclinical models by us to prevent the formation of calcium oxalate. We therefore believe that a one-time administration of an ARCUS nuclease targeting HAO1 may be a viable strategy for a durable treatment of PH1 patients. In preclinical studies we have demonstrated in a mouse model of PH1 that administration of an ARCUS nuclease targeting HAO1 resulted in approximately 70% reduction in urine calcium oxalate levels. We have also demonstrated that ARCUS efficiently knocked out the HAO1 gene in non-human primates. We plan to select a clinical candidate for this program during 2020.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we opened our Manufacturing Center for Advanced Therapeutics, or MCAT, which we believe is the first in-house current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facility dedicated to genome-edited, off-the-shelf CAR T cell therapy product candidates in the United States. MCAT will enable in-house production of three different drug substances: allogeneic CAR T cells, messenger RNA (including formulations development) and adeno-associated viral vectors. We are currently using this new manufacturing center to create clinical trial material to be used in our BCMA targeting allogeneic CAR T clinical trials beginning in 2020. We believe MCAT confers a number of strategic advantages including cost benefits, control of our manufacturing process and strategic flexibility as we execute our clinical trials. In the longer term, we believe MCAT has the potential to be a commercial launch facility.\nSince our formation in 2006, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing ARCUS, conducting research and development activities, recruiting skilled personnel, developing manufacturing processes, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our IPO, the sale of our convertible preferred stock and upfront payments from licensing arrangements.\nOn April 1, 2019, we completed our IPO of 9,085,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 1,185,000 additional shares of common stock, at an offering price of $16.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $130.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. To date, we have generated approximately $475.4 million from third parties through a combination of financings including through our IPO, preferred stock and convertible note financings, an upfront payment under the Servier Agreement and additional funding from other strategic alliances and grants.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and have not generated any revenue from the sale of products. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. Our net losses were $92.9 million and $46.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $177.1 million.\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase substantially in connection with the expansion of our product development programs and capabilities. We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public equity, debt financings or other sources, which may include current and new collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will ever generate significant revenue to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of therapeutic and agricultural products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be required to raise additional capital on terms that are unfavorable to us or we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nWe currently conduct our operations through two reportable segments: Therapeutics and Food. Our Therapeutics segment is focused on allogeneic CAR T immunotherapy and in vivo gene correction. Our Food segment focuses on applying ARCUS to develop food and nutrition products through collaboration agreements with consumer-facing companies.\nCollaborations\nGilead\nIn September 2018, we and Gilead entered into a collaboration and license agreement, which we refer to as the Gilead Agreement, to develop genome editing tools using ARCUS to target viral DNA associated with the Hepatitis B virus. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Gilead received an exclusive license to exploit the resulting synthetic nucleases and products that use them to treat the Hepatitis B virus in humans, and we are entitled to receive up to approximately $40.0 million in research funding over an initial three year term and milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $445.0 million, consisting of up to $105.0 million in development milestone payments and up to $340.0 million in commercial milestone payments. We are also entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the high single digit percentages to the mid-teen percentages on worldwide net sales of the products developed through the term of the agreement, subject to customary potential reductions.\nWe recognized $13.3 million and $3.7 million in revenues under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and recorded $1.5 million and $2.3 million in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. We did not receive any milestone payments under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.\nServier\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement, pursuant to which we have agreed to develop allogeneic CAR T cell therapies for up to six unique antigen targets. One target was selected at the agreement's inception. Upon selection of an antigen target under the agreement, we have agreed to perform early-stage research and development on individual T cell modifications for the selected target, develop the resulting therapeutic product candidates through Phase 1 clinical trials and prepare clinical trial material of such product candidates for use in Phase 2 clinical trials.\nWe received an upfront payment of $105.0 million under the Servier Agreement. We have the ability to receive total payments, including the upfront payment, option fees and milestone payments, in the aggregate across all six targets, of up to approximately $1.6 billion. This includes up to $1.5 billion in milestone payments, consisting of up to $401.3 million in development milestone payments and up to $1.1 billion in commercial milestone payments. We are also entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digit percentages to the sub-teen percentages on worldwide net sales, subject to potential customary reductions. We also have the right to participate in the development and commercialization of any licensed products resulting from the collaboration through a 50/50 co-development and co-promotion option in the United States, subject to our payment of an option fee, which is exercisable after Servier's commercial option exercise.\nUnder the Servier Agreement, we recognized $7.3 million and $5.8 million in revenues during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The amount recorded as deferred revenue was $80.9 million and $88.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. No development or sales-based milestones were received for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales in the foreseeable future. We record revenue from collaboration agreements, including amounts related to upfront payments, annual fees for licenses of our intellectual property and research and development funding.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates. These include the following:\n \u2022 salaries, benefits and other related costs, including share-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; \n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third parties that conduct preclinical research and development activities and clinical trials on our behalf; \n \u2022 costs of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and ongoing and future clinical trials, including the costs of contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and our MCAT facility that will manufacture our clinical trial material for use in our preclinical studies and ongoing and potential future clinical trials; \n \u2022 costs of outside consultants, including their fees and related travel expenses; \n \u2022 costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 license payments made for intellectual property used in research and development activities; and \n \u2022 facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs if specifically identifiable to research activities. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We track external research and development costs, including the costs of laboratory supplies and services, outsourced research and development, clinical trials, contract manufacturing, laboratory equipment and maintenance and certain other development costs, by product candidate when the program IND application is accepted by the FDA. Internal and external costs associated with infrastructure resources, other research and development costs, facility related costs and depreciation and amortization that are not identifiable to a specific product candidate are included in the platform development, early-stage research and unallocated expenses category in the table below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program for the periods presented:\nTable 343: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and development expenses by product candidate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CD19 external development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,928\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CD20 external development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BCMA external development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Platform development, early-stage research and unallocated expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Laboratory supplies and services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outsourced research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CMOs and research organizations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Laboratory equipment and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facility-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licensing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other research and development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (937\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase substantially for the foreseeable future and will comprise a larger percentage of our total expenses as we continue our Phase 1/2a clinical trial for our CD19 product candidate, commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for our CD20 product candidate, commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for our BCMA product candidate, and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of ongoing and future clinical trials of our CD19, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, or any other product candidate we may develop or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our CD19, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, and any other our product candidate we may develop will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of clinical trials of our CD19, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, as well as of any future clinical trials of other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct; \n \u2022 uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates; \n \u2022 the actual probability of success for our product candidates, including their safety and efficacy, early clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability; \n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; \n \u2022 the timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; and \n \u2022 the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to slower than expected patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, business development, operations and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs that are not specifically attributable to research activities.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our personnel headcount to support our continued research activities and development of product candidates. We also expect to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements; director and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs.\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\nWe elected on issuance to account for the convertible notes payable we issued in March 2019, or the 2019 Notes, at fair value until their settlement. The change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was recognized through the statement of operations. The 2019 Notes settled into 2,921,461 shares of common stock on the closing of our IPO on April 1, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception in 2006, we have generated cumulative federal and state net operating loss and R&D credit carryforwards for which we have not recorded any net tax benefit due to the uncertainty around utilizing these tax attributes within their respective carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2019, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $101.3 million, $101.7 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income. The U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $19.7 million will begin to expire in 2030 while the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards of $81.6 million carry forward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2025. As of December 31, 2019, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $7.2 million, which begin to expire in 2027. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had federal Orphan Drug credits of $1.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2038. As of December 31, 2019, we also have federal contribution carryforwards of $0.1 million, which begin to expire in 2020. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into United States law. The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal tax rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). The federal tax rate change resulted in a reduction in the gross amount of our deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2017, and a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance. As a result, no income tax expense or benefit was recognized as of the enactment date of the TCJA.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, together with the changes in those items in dollars:\nTable 350: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87,204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,912\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39,292\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of convertible note payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,758\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,758\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (182\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (182\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,673\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,548\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (92,877\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (46,037\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (46,840\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $22.2 million, compared to $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The increase of $37.3 million was primarily due to a $31.9 million increase in platform development, early-stage research and unallocated expenses, a $9.4 million and $4.9 million increase in direct research and development expenses related to our CD20 and BCMA programs, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in direct research and development expenses related to our CD19 program of $8.9 million.\nThe increase in direct research and development expenses for our CD20 and BCMA programs was due to increases in lab services and CMO and research organization costs as we prepare to enter planned Phase 1/2a clinical trials in 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in our CD19 expenses primarily due to lower spending on CMO and research organization costs.\nPlatform development, early-stage research and unallocated expenses increased primarily due to a $11.6 million increase in employee-related costs associated with increased headcount to support our technology platform development and manufacturing capabilities, a $7.6 million increase in laboratory supplies and services, a $5.4 million increase in outsourced research and development spending and $2.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $13.3 million was primarily due to an increase of $6.2 million in employee-related costs as we increased our general and administrative headcount, $2.7 million in consulting fees, $2.1 million in increased administrative costs, including insurance, franchise and property taxes, bank fees, and costs related to operating as a public company, and $1.4 million in facility related costs.\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\nWe elected on issuance to account for the 2019 Notes at fair value until their settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $9.8 million of expense as changes in fair value. The 2019 Notes were settled on the closing of the IPO in April 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $2.4 million of interest income generated on our cash and cash equivalent balances was the result of lower interest rates and having higher cash balances invested in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSegment Results\nThe following tables summarize segment revenues and segment operating loss (see Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our segments):\nTable 352: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operational cash expenditures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment operational cash expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allocation of centralized research and development operational\ncash expenditures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total allocation of centralized research and development\noperational cash expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating income (loss):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Therapeutics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (49,427\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (37,127\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,378\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,666\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (54,805\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (47,793\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe evaluate the operating performance of each segment based on segment operating loss. Segment operating loss is derived by deducting operational cash expenditures, net, from GAAP revenue. Operational cash expenditures are cash disbursements made that are specifically identifiable to the reportable segment (including specifically identifiable research and development and property, equipment and software expenditures). For the year ended December 31, 2018, we allocated centralized research and development expenditures for early stage research, nuclease development and the purchase of general laboratory supplies to the Therapeutics and Food segments based on headcount. In January 2019, the Food segment moved into a new leased facility in Durham, North Carolina. We have determined that the Food segment is no longer deriving benefit from the Company's centralized research and development expenditures, thus all these expenditures were allocated to the Therapeutics segment for the year ended December 31, 2019. The reportable segment and centralized research and development operational cash expenditures include cash disbursements for compensation, laboratory supplies, purchases of property, equipment and software and procuring services from CROs, CMOs and research organizations. We do not allocate general operational expenses or non-cash income statement amounts to our reportable segments.\nTherapeutics Segment\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $20.6 million, compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $11.1 million was primarily the result of a $9.6 million increase in research funding from Gilead and $1.5 million increase in revenue from Servier. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $45.9 million, compared to $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $10.9 million in operational cash expenditures was primarily due to an increase in payments made to service providers for contract manufacturing and clinical trial research, laboratory supplies and services, employee headcount and fixed assets for the build out of our manufacturing capabilities, offset by a decrease in payments made to the University of Pennsylvania, which is early stage research and not considered specific to any one therapeutic area. As a result, these payments were classified as centralized research and development expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2019 as opposed to being classified as Therapeutics operational cash expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2018. Segment operating loss increased $12.3 million from $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the factors discussed above.\nFood Segment\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.6 million, compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $0.2 million was primarily attributable to $0.4 million from a new customer agreement with a collaboration partner entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019 offset by a $0.2 million decrease in revenue from a collaboration partner. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $7.0 million, compared to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $2.1 million was primarily due to a decrease in leasehold improvements, which is attributable to large construction expenditures made in the year ended December 31, 2018 for work done to our leased facility that did not occur in the year ended December 31, 2019, as our Food segment moved into the facility in January 2019. This decrease in spending was offset by increases in laboratory equipment, furniture and fixtures, laboratory supplies, employee headcount and rent. Segment operating loss decreased $5.3 million from $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the factors discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will continue to increase, including in connection with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, contracting with CROs and CMOs, the addition of laboratory equipment to MCAT in support of preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources. We do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales.\nWe have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our IPO, the sale of our convertible preferred stock and upfront payments from collaboration and licensing arrangements. On April 1, 2019, we completed our IPO of 9,085,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 1,185,000 additional shares of common stock, at an offering price of $16.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $130.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. To date, we have generated approximately $475.4 million from third parties through a combination of financings including through our IPO, preferred stock and convertible note financings, an upfront payment under the Servier Agreement and additional funding from other strategic alliances and grants.\nIn May 2019, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the Pacific Western Loan Agreement\u201d) with PWB pursuant to which we may request advances on a revolving line of credit of up to an aggregate principal of $50.0 million (the Revolving Line\u201d). The Pacific Western Loan Agreement was amended (the PWB Amendment\u201d) in December 2019 to allow the Company to maintain a bank account with a non-affiliated bank in the United Kingdom provided that the account balance does not exceed 1.5 million GBP or its U.S. dollar equivalent at any time. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our Revolving Line and were in compliance with its financial covenants.\nCash Flows\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $180.9 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $103.2 million as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the periods presented:\nTable 353: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (71,015\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (51,723\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,666\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,663\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows for the Year ended December 31, 2019\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $71.0 million, driven primarily by our net loss of $92.9 million as we incurred expenses associated with our CD19, CD20, and BCMA programs, platform development and early-stage research, and general and administrative expenses, and a decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $2.4 million, partially offset by net non-cash expenses of $24.2 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $24.7 million, which was attributable to purchases of property, equipment and software.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $173.4 million, consisting of $130.5 million in proceeds from our IPO, net of issuance costs, the net proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 Notes of $39.6 million, and $1.3 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.\nDebt Obligations\nIn March 2019, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $39.6 million of 2019 Notes in a private placement transaction. Upon settlement, the change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was $9.8 million and the accrued interest on the 2019 Notes was $0.2 million. Pursuant to their terms, the 2019 Notes were settled in 2,921,461 shares of our common stock upon the closing of our IPO at a settlement price of $13.60 per share, which is equal to 85% of the IPO price per share.\nIn May 2019, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Pacific Western Bank pursuant to which we may request advances on a $50.0 million revolving line of credit.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $51.7 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $46.0 million as we incurred expenses associated with our CD19 program, platform development and early-stage research and general and administrative expenses. In addition, we had non-cash charges of $4.8 million for depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense. Net cash used in operating activities was also impacted by $10.5 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities, including $7.5 million in prepaid expenses, $3.2 million in deferred revenue, $0.5 million in accounts receivable, $0.7 million in accounts payable and $0.4 million in other current assets and other assets, which were partially offset by changes of $1.8 million in accrued expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $15.7 million, which was attributable to purchases of property, equipment and software of $14.3 million and the acquisition of intellectual property of $1.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $107.8 million, consisting of the net proceeds from the issuance of our Series B convertible preferred stock financing of $109.7 million, net of offering costs, and $0.2 million in proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by $2.1 million in payments for deferred offering costs associated with our initial public offering.\nLoan and Security Agreement\nIn May 2019, we entered into the Pacific Western Loan Agreement pursuant to which we may request advances on a $50.0 million Revolving Line. The maturity date of the Revolving Line is May 15, 2022. The Revolving Line bears interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 1.25% below the prime rate then in effect, or (ii) 4.25% at all times when we maintain a daily balance of cash in our demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million, and the greater of (i) 0.25% above the prime rate then in effect; or (ii) 5.75% at all times when we do not maintain a daily balance of cash in demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million; provided that, we are permitted to maintain a bank account with a non-affiliated bank in the United Kingdom so long as the account balance does not exceed 1.5 million GBP or its U.S. dollar equivalent at any time, pursuant to the PWB Amendment. We are required to pay a fee in an amount equal to 0.50% per annum of the unused portion of the Revolving Line each quarter, or the Unused Fee. The Unused Fee shall be waived for any quarter in which we maintain a daily balance of cash in our demand deposit account at PWB of at least $25.0 million at all times during such quarter. If the Revolving Line is terminated prior to the maturity date, we are required to pay an early termination fee equal to 1.0% of the Revolving Line.\nUnder the terms of the Pacific Western Loan Agreement, we granted PWB a security interest in substantially all of our assets, excluding any of the intellectual property now or hereafter owned, (but including any rights to payment from the sale or licensing of any such intellectual property). We must maintain an aggregate balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand at PWB (or PWB's affiliates) at least equal to any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line and any other outstanding obligations the we have to PWB. The agreement was amended in December 2019 to allow a bank account with a non-affiliated bank in the United Kingdom provided that the account balance does not exceed 1.5 million GBP or its U.S. dollar equivalent at any time.\nThe Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants (affirmative and negative), and includes standard events of default, including in the event of a material adverse change. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, PWB may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as are set forth in the loan and security agreement and increase the interest rate otherwise applicable to the amount outstanding under the Revolving Line by an additional 3.00%.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our Revolving Line, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants, under the Pacific Western Loan Agreement.\nFunding Requirements\nOur operating expenses increased substantially in 2019 and are expected to increase substantially in the future in connection with the initiation of additional human clinical trials and capital expenditures for MCAT.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2021. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical and agricultural products, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the progress, costs and results of our clinical development for our CD19, CD20, and BCMA programs as we initiate and progress clinical trials, including CRO costs; \n \u2022 the progress, costs and results of our additional research and preclinical development programs; \n \u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of internal process development and manufacturing scale-up activities and contract with CMOs associated with our CD19, CD20, and BCMA programs and other programs we advance through preclinical and clinical development; \n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of any product candidates that we may derive from ARCUS or any other product candidates we may develop alone or with collaborators; \n \u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims; and \n \u2022 the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval. \nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings, collaboration agreements, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and/or distribution arrangements.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, shareholders' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, product development and research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 363: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total(2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Lease Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents future minimum lease payments under our operating leases for office and/or lab space at the following locations: 302 East Pettigrew Street, Durham, North Carolina expiring in July 2024, 3054 Cornwallis Road, Durham, North Carolina expiring in April 2026 and 20 TW Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina expiring in August 2027 (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these lease agreements). \n (2) We have entered into a license agreement with an undisclosed licensee for intellectual property used in our research programs.

We have excluded these potential milestone payments in the contractual obligations table because the timing and likelihood of these contingent payments are not currently known and would be difficult to predict or estimate. \n (3) This table does not reflect principal and interest payments payable pursuant to our Pacific Western Loan Agreement. which we entered into in May 2019, pursuant to which we may request advances on a revolving line of credit of up to an aggregate principal of $50.0 million, or the Revolving Line. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our Revolving Line. The maturity date of the Revolving Line is May 15, 2022. The Revolving Line bears interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 1.25% below the prime rate then in effect, or (ii) 4.25% at all times when we maintain a daily balance of cash in our demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million, and the greater of (i) 0.25% above the prime rate then in effect; or (ii) 5.75% at all times when we do not maintain a daily balance of cash in demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million. The Pacific Western Loan Agreement requires that we pay a quarterly fee in an amount equal to 0.50% per annum of the unused portion of the Revolving Line. The unused fee shall be waived for any quarter we maintain a daily balance in our demand deposit accounts of at least $25.0 million. If the Revolving Line is terminated prior to the maturity date, we are required to pay an early termination fee equal to 1.0% of the Revolving Line. \nIn addition, we have entered into the Duke License, under which we are obligated to make aggregate future milestone payments of up to $0.2 million upon the achievement of specified corporate milestones as well as low-single digit percent royalty payments based on future net sales of applicable products and generally mid-teen percent royalties based on sublicensing revenue. See Business-License and Collaboration Agreements\u201d for more information regarding our payment obligations under the Duke License. We have not included future payments under the Duke License in the table above since the payment obligations under the Duke License are contingent upon future events, such as the achievement of specified milestones or generating product sales, and we are unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales.\nWe also enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs, universities and other third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the table above as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research, license, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales. We classify payments received under these agreements as revenues within our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605\u201d). ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nAt contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we evaluate the performance obligations promised in the contract that are based on goods and services that will be transferred to the customer and determine whether those obligations are both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the contract. Goods or services that meet these criteria are considered distinct performance obligations. If both these criteria are not met, the goods and services are combined into a single performance obligation. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and, if so, these options are considered performance obligations. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nWe recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time this is based on the use of an output or input method.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue within current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue - noncurrent. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet received or invoiced are generally recognized as contract assets in the Other line item in our consolidated balance sheets.\nMilestone Payments - If an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nRoyalties - For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor relationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\nSignificant Financing Component - In determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assessed each of our revenue arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nCollaborative Arrangements - We have entered into collaboration agreements, which are within the scope of ASC 606, to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple promises or obligations, which may include: (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaboration partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASU No. 2018-18 Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, are within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement for the licensing of our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform and the research, development, and manufacturing of product for clinical trials and commercialization of products. In September 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Gilead, which we refer to as the Gilead Agreement, to develop genome editing tools using our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform. Both agreements use our genome editing technology for the treatment of certain diseases. Consideration we received, or may receive, under these collaboration and license agreements include upfront nonrefundable payments, research funding payments and payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales.\nUnder the guidance of ASC 606, certain judgments affect revenue recognition. Our primary performance obligations under our agreements consist of research and development services. Measuring the amount of time it takes for us to complete these services includes estimating our total effort to satisfy our performance obligations at the outset of the agreement and then comparing that amount to the actual effort expended for a given accounting period. In certain instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the timing of satisfying these obligations and timing may change due to efforts beyond our control, such as changes in the customer's direction of a particular research program or changes to the contractual terms of an agreement. Accordingly, our estimates may change in the future. Such changes to estimates will result in a change in prospective revenue recognition amounts.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to the following:\n \u2022 CROs and other third parties in connection with performing research and development activities, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf; \n \u2022 Vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and \n \u2022 CMOs and other vendors in connection with product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical supplies. \nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials and CMOs that manufacture product for our research and development activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may cause us to report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other share-based awards granted to our employees, directors, consultants and advisors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards, net of actual forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. As we have limited trading history, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded share price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing a weighted value considering actual history and estimated expected term based on the midpoint of final vest date and expiration date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. The JOBS Act also exempts us from having to provide an auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b).\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results together with the section captioned Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a life sciences company dedicated to improving life through the application of our pioneering, proprietary ARCUS genome editing platform. We leverage ARCUS in the development of our product candidates, which are designed to treat human diseases and create healthy and sustainable food and agricultural solutions. We are actively developing product candidates in three innovative areas: allogeneic CAR T cell immunotherapy, in vivo gene correction, and food. We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory, or R/R, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, or R/R B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or B-ALL. PBCAR0191 is our first gene-edited allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, T cell therapy candidate targeting CD19 and is being developed in collaboration with Les Laboratoires Servier, or Servier. We have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR0191 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of ALL. Made from donor-derived T cells modified using our ARCUS genome editing technology, PBCAR0191 recognizes the well characterized tumor cell surface protein CD19, an important and validated target in several B-cell cancers, and is designed to avoid graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD, a significant complication associated with donor-derived, cell-based therapies. We believe that this trial, which is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of PBCAR0191 at increasing dose levels, as well as to evaluate anti-tumor activity, is the first U.S.-based clinical trial to evaluate an allogeneic CAR T therapy for R/R NHL. Furthermore, we believe that our proprietary, one-step engineering process for producing allogeneic CAR T cells with a potentially optimized cell phenotype, at large scale in a cost-effective manner, will enable us to overcome the fundamental clinical and manufacturing challenges that have limited the CAR T field to date.\nIn December 2019, we announced initial data from this ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of PBCAR0191 in adult patients with R/R NHL and R/R B-ALL. A total of nine adult patients were reported in these initial Phase 1 trial results, including six with NHL (three treated at Dose Level 1 (3x105 cells/kg), or DL1, and three treated at Dose Level 2 (1x106 cells/kg), or DL2), and three with B-ALL (all treated at DL2). These data indicated no serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities. In the NHL cohort, four of six patients demonstrated an objective tumor response by Lugano criteria at day 28, for an overall objective response rate of 67%, including three partial responses and one complete response. In the ALL cohort, one of three patients achieved a complete response at day 28 following treatment with PBCAR0191. As of December 31, 2019, dosing of patients at Dose Level 3 (3x106 cells/kg) was underway. Based on the data observed at DL1 and DL2, we filed a protocol amendment for this trial with the FDA in December 2019. The amended trial design is intended to specifically address key clinical questions. These include assessing the impact of higher total doses of cells on clinical activity and/or the impact of modified lymphodepletion on the ability to achieve durable clinical benefit with associated CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Following feedback from the FDA in late January 2020, the protocol amendment is now being implemented.\nIn September 2019, the FDA accepted our investigational new drug, or IND, application for our second allogeneic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR20A, for which we expect to commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in the first quarter of 2020. PBCAR20A is wholly owned by us and targets the validated tumor cell surface target CD20. It will be investigated in subjects with NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL. A subset of the NHL patients will have the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, and we have received orphan drug designation for PBCAR20A from the FDA for the treatment of this disease. Based on the adverse events observed to date with PBCAR0191, the FDA has agreed to allow us to commence dosing with PBCAR20A directly at Dose Level 2, which we expect to accelerate the timing for our expected completion of the trial.\nIn January 2020, the FDA accepted our IND application for our third allogeneic CAR T cell therapy product candidate, PBCAR269A, for which we expect to commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in 2020. PBCAR269A is wholly owned by us and is designed to target the validated tumor cell surface target BCMA. It will be investigated in subjects with R/R multiple myeloma and we have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for this indication.\nAlso in January 2020, we announced that we expect to advance a program targeting the rare genetic disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1, or PH1 as our lead wholly owned in vivo gene correction program. PH1 affects approximately 1-3 people per million in the United States and is caused by loss of function mutations in the AGXT gene, leading to the accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys. Patients suffer from painful kidney stones which may ultimately lead to renal failure. Using ARCUS, we are developing a potential therapeutic approach to the treatment of PH1 that involves knocking out a gene called HAO1 which acts upstream of AGXT. Suppressing HAO1 has been shown in preclinical models by us to prevent the formation of calcium oxalate. We therefore believe that a one-time administration of an ARCUS nuclease targeting HAO1 may be a viable strategy for a durable treatment of PH1 patients. In preclinical studies we have demonstrated in a mouse model of PH1 that administration of an ARCUS nuclease targeting HAO1 resulted in approximately 70% reduction in urine calcium oxalate levels. We have also demonstrated that ARCUS efficiently knocked out the HAO1 gene in non-human primates. We plan to select a clinical candidate for this program during 2020.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we opened our Manufacturing Center for Advanced Therapeutics, or MCAT, which we believe is the first in-house current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facility dedicated to genome-edited, off-the-shelf CAR T cell therapy product candidates in the United States. MCAT will enable in-house production of three different drug substances: allogeneic CAR T cells, messenger RNA (including formulations development) and adeno-associated viral vectors. We are currently using this new manufacturing center to create clinical trial material to be used in our BCMA targeting allogeneic CAR T clinical trials beginning in 2020. We believe MCAT confers a number of strategic advantages including cost benefits, control of our manufacturing process and strategic flexibility as we execute our clinical trials. In the longer term, we believe MCAT has the potential to be a commercial launch facility.\nSince our formation in 2006, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing ARCUS, conducting research and development activities, recruiting skilled personnel, developing manufacturing processes, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our IPO, the sale of our convertible preferred stock and upfront payments from licensing arrangements.\nOn April 1, 2019, we completed our IPO of 9,085,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 1,185,000 additional shares of common stock, at an offering price of $16.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $130.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. To date, we have generated approximately $475.4 million from third parties through a combination of financings including through our IPO, preferred stock and convertible note financings, an upfront payment under the Servier Agreement and additional funding from other strategic alliances and grants.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and have not generated any revenue from the sale of products. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. Our net losses were $92.9 million and $46.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $177.1 million.\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase substantially in connection with the expansion of our product development programs and capabilities. We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one of our product candidates or the product candidates of our collaborators for which we may receive milestone payments or royalties. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public equity, debt financings or other sources, which may include current and new collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will ever generate significant revenue to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of therapeutic and agricultural products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be required to raise additional capital on terms that are unfavorable to us or we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nWe currently conduct our operations through two reportable segments: Therapeutics and Food. Our Therapeutics segment is focused on allogeneic CAR T immunotherapy and in vivo gene correction. Our Food segment focuses on applying ARCUS to develop food and nutrition products through collaboration agreements with consumer-facing companies.\nCollaborations\nGilead\nIn September 2018, we and Gilead entered into a collaboration and license agreement, which we refer to as the Gilead Agreement, to develop genome editing tools using ARCUS to target viral DNA associated with the Hepatitis B virus. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Gilead received an exclusive license to exploit the resulting synthetic nucleases and products that use them to treat the Hepatitis B virus in humans, and we are entitled to receive up to approximately $40.0 million in research funding over an initial three year term and milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $445.0 million, consisting of up to $105.0 million in development milestone payments and up to $340.0 million in commercial milestone payments. We are also entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the high single digit percentages to the mid-teen percentages on worldwide net sales of the products developed through the term of the agreement, subject to customary potential reductions.\nWe recognized $13.3 million and $3.7 million in revenues under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and recorded $1.5 million and $2.3 million in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. We did not receive any milestone payments under the Gilead Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.\nServier\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement, pursuant to which we have agreed to develop allogeneic CAR T cell therapies for up to six unique antigen targets. One target was selected at the agreement's inception. Upon selection of an antigen target under the agreement, we have agreed to perform early-stage research and development on individual T cell modifications for the selected target, develop the resulting therapeutic product candidates through Phase 1 clinical trials and prepare clinical trial material of such product candidates for use in Phase 2 clinical trials.\nWe received an upfront payment of $105.0 million under the Servier Agreement. We have the ability to receive total payments, including the upfront payment, option fees and milestone payments, in the aggregate across all six targets, of up to approximately $1.6 billion. This includes up to $1.5 billion in milestone payments, consisting of up to $401.3 million in development milestone payments and up to $1.1 billion in commercial milestone payments. We are also entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digit percentages to the sub-teen percentages on worldwide net sales, subject to potential customary reductions. We also have the right to participate in the development and commercialization of any licensed products resulting from the collaboration through a 50/50 co-development and co-promotion option in the United States, subject to our payment of an option fee, which is exercisable after Servier's commercial option exercise.\nUnder the Servier Agreement, we recognized $7.3 million and $5.8 million in revenues during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The amount recorded as deferred revenue was $80.9 million and $88.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. No development or sales-based milestones were received for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales in the foreseeable future. We record revenue from collaboration agreements, including amounts related to upfront payments, annual fees for licenses of our intellectual property and research and development funding.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates. These include the following:\n \u2022 salaries, benefits and other related costs, including share-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; \n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third parties that conduct preclinical research and development activities and clinical trials on our behalf; \n \u2022 costs of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and ongoing and future clinical trials, including the costs of contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and our MCAT facility that will manufacture our clinical trial material for use in our preclinical studies and ongoing and potential future clinical trials; \n \u2022 costs of outside consultants, including their fees and related travel expenses; \n \u2022 costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 license payments made for intellectual property used in research and development activities; and \n \u2022 facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs if specifically identifiable to research activities. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We track external research and development costs, including the costs of laboratory supplies and services, outsourced research and development, clinical trials, contract manufacturing, laboratory equipment and maintenance and certain other development costs, by product candidate when the program IND application is accepted by the FDA. Internal and external costs associated with infrastructure resources, other research and development costs, facility related costs and depreciation and amortization that are not identifiable to a specific product candidate are included in the platform development, early-stage research and unallocated expenses category in the table below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program for the periods presented:\n\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase substantially for the foreseeable future and will comprise a larger percentage of our total expenses as we continue our Phase 1/2a clinical trial for our CD19 product candidate, commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for our CD20 product candidate, commence a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for our BCMA product candidate, and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of ongoing and future clinical trials of our CD19, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, or any other product candidate we may develop or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our CD19, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, and any other our product candidate we may develop will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of clinical trials of our CD19, CD20, and BCMA product candidates, as well as of any future clinical trials of other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct; \n \u2022 uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates; \n \u2022 the actual probability of success for our product candidates, including their safety and efficacy, early clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability; \n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; \n \u2022 the timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; and \n \u2022 the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to slower than expected patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, business development, operations and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs that are not specifically attributable to research activities.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our personnel headcount to support our continued research activities and development of product candidates. We also expect to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements; director and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs.\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\nWe elected on issuance to account for the convertible notes payable we issued in March 2019, or the 2019 Notes, at fair value until their settlement. The change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was recognized through the statement of operations. The 2019 Notes settled into 2,921,461 shares of common stock on the closing of our IPO on April 1, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception in 2006, we have generated cumulative federal and state net operating loss and R&D credit carryforwards for which we have not recorded any net tax benefit due to the uncertainty around utilizing these tax attributes within their respective carryforward periods. As of December 31, 2019, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $101.3 million, $101.7 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income. The U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $19.7 million will begin to expire in 2030 while the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards of $81.6 million carry forward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2025. As of December 31, 2019, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $7.2 million, which begin to expire in 2027. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had federal Orphan Drug credits of $1.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2038. As of December 31, 2019, we also have federal contribution carryforwards of $0.1 million, which begin to expire in 2020. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into United States law. The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing tax law, including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal tax rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as well as a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). The federal tax rate change resulted in a reduction in the gross amount of our deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2017, and a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance. As a result, no income tax expense or benefit was recognized as of the enactment date of the TCJA.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, together with the changes in those items in dollars:\n\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $22.2 million, compared to $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $11.3 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily the result of a $9.6 million increase in research revenue recognized from Gilead as 2019 was the first full year of revenue recognized under the Gilead agreement initiated in September 2018 and a $1.5 million increase in collaboration revenue recognized from Servier.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $82.4 million, compared to $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $37.3 million was primarily due to a $31.9 million increase in platform development, early-stage research and unallocated expenses, a $9.4 million and $4.9 million increase in direct research and development expenses related to our CD20 and BCMA programs, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in direct research and development expenses related to our CD19 program of $8.9 million.\nThe increase in direct research and development expenses for our CD20 and BCMA programs was due to increases in lab services and CMO and research organization costs as we prepare to enter planned Phase 1/2a clinical trials in 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in our CD19 expenses primarily due to lower spending on CMO and research organization costs.\nPlatform development, early-stage research and unallocated expenses increased primarily due to a $11.6 million increase in employee-related costs associated with increased headcount to support our technology platform development and manufacturing capabilities, a $7.6 million increase in laboratory supplies and services, a $5.4 million increase in outsourced research and development spending and $2.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $13.3 million was primarily due to an increase of $6.2 million in employee-related costs as we increased our general and administrative headcount, $2.7 million in consulting fees, $2.1 million in increased administrative costs, including insurance, franchise and property taxes, bank fees, and costs related to operating as a public company, and $1.4 million in facility related costs.\nChange in Fair Value of Convertible Notes Payable\nWe elected on issuance to account for the 2019 Notes at fair value until their settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $9.8 million of expense as changes in fair value. The 2019 Notes were settled on the closing of the IPO in April 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of interest from the 2019 Notes at a rate of 6% per annum.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $2.4 million of interest income generated on our cash and cash equivalent balances was the result of lower interest rates and having higher cash balances invested in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSegment Results\nThe following tables summarize segment revenues and segment operating loss (see Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our segments):\n\nWe evaluate the operating performance of each segment based on segment operating loss. Segment operating loss is derived by deducting operational cash expenditures, net, from GAAP revenue. Operational cash expenditures are cash disbursements made that are specifically identifiable to the reportable segment (including specifically identifiable research and development and property, equipment and software expenditures). For the year ended December 31, 2018, we allocated centralized research and development expenditures for early stage research, nuclease development and the purchase of general laboratory supplies to the Therapeutics and Food segments based on headcount. In January 2019, the Food segment moved into a new leased facility in Durham, North Carolina. We have determined that the Food segment is no longer deriving benefit from the Company's centralized research and development expenditures, thus all these expenditures were allocated to the Therapeutics segment for the year ended December 31, 2019. The reportable segment and centralized research and development operational cash expenditures include cash disbursements for compensation, laboratory supplies, purchases of property, equipment and software and procuring services from CROs, CMOs and research organizations. We do not allocate general operational expenses or non-cash income statement amounts to our reportable segments.\nTherapeutics Segment\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $20.6 million, compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $11.1 million was primarily the result of a $9.6 million increase in research funding from Gilead and $1.5 million increase in revenue from Servier. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $45.9 million, compared to $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $10.9 million in operational cash expenditures was primarily due to an increase in payments made to service providers for contract manufacturing and clinical trial research, laboratory supplies and services, employee headcount and fixed assets for the build out of our manufacturing capabilities, offset by a decrease in payments made to the University of Pennsylvania, which is early stage research and not considered specific to any one therapeutic area. As a result, these payments were classified as centralized research and development expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2019 as opposed to being classified as Therapeutics operational cash expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2018. Segment operating loss increased $12.3 million from $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the factors discussed above.\nFood Segment\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.6 million, compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $0.2 million was primarily attributable to $0.4 million from a new customer agreement with a collaboration partner entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019 offset by a $0.2 million decrease in revenue from a collaboration partner. Segment operational cash expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $7.0 million, compared to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $2.1 million was primarily due to a decrease in leasehold improvements, which is attributable to large construction expenditures made in the year ended December 31, 2018 for work done to our leased facility that did not occur in the year ended December 31, 2019, as our Food segment moved into the facility in January 2019. This decrease in spending was offset by increases in laboratory equipment, furniture and fixtures, laboratory supplies, employee headcount and rent. Segment operating loss decreased $5.3 million from $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the factors discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will continue to increase, including in connection with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, contracting with CROs and CMOs, the addition of laboratory equipment to MCAT in support of preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources. We do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales.\nWe have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our IPO, the sale of our convertible preferred stock and upfront payments from collaboration and licensing arrangements. On April 1, 2019, we completed our IPO of 9,085,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 1,185,000 additional shares of common stock, at an offering price of $16.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $130.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. To date, we have generated approximately $475.4 million from third parties through a combination of financings including through our IPO, preferred stock and convertible note financings, an upfront payment under the Servier Agreement and additional funding from other strategic alliances and grants.\nIn May 2019, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the Pacific Western Loan Agreement\u201d) with PWB pursuant to which we may request advances on a revolving line of credit of up to an aggregate principal of $50.0 million (the Revolving Line\u201d). The Pacific Western Loan Agreement was amended (the PWB Amendment\u201d) in December 2019 to allow the Company to maintain a bank account with a non-affiliated bank in the United Kingdom provided that the account balance does not exceed 1.5 million GBP or its U.S. dollar equivalent at any time. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our Revolving Line and were in compliance with its financial covenants.\nCash Flows\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $180.9 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $103.2 million as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the periods presented:\n\nCash Flows for the Year ended December 31, 2019\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $71.0 million, driven primarily by our net loss of $92.9 million as we incurred expenses associated with our CD19, CD20, and BCMA programs, platform development and early-stage research, and general and administrative expenses, and a decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $2.4 million, partially offset by net non-cash expenses of $24.2 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $24.7 million, which was attributable to purchases of property, equipment and software.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $173.4 million, consisting of $130.5 million in proceeds from our IPO, net of issuance costs, the net proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 Notes of $39.6 million, and $1.3 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.\nDebt Obligations\nIn March 2019, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $39.6 million of 2019 Notes in a private placement transaction. Upon settlement, the change in fair value of the 2019 Notes was $9.8 million and the accrued interest on the 2019 Notes was $0.2 million. Pursuant to their terms, the 2019 Notes were settled in 2,921,461 shares of our common stock upon the closing of our IPO at a settlement price of $13.60 per share, which is equal to 85% of the IPO price per share.\nIn May 2019, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Pacific Western Bank pursuant to which we may request advances on a $50.0 million revolving line of credit.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $51.7 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $46.0 million as we incurred expenses associated with our CD19 program, platform development and early-stage research and general and administrative expenses. In addition, we had non-cash charges of $4.8 million for depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense. Net cash used in operating activities was also impacted by $10.5 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities, including $7.5 million in prepaid expenses, $3.2 million in deferred revenue, $0.5 million in accounts receivable, $0.7 million in accounts payable and $0.4 million in other current assets and other assets, which were partially offset by changes of $1.8 million in accrued expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $15.7 million, which was attributable to purchases of property, equipment and software of $14.3 million and the acquisition of intellectual property of $1.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $107.8 million, consisting of the net proceeds from the issuance of our Series B convertible preferred stock financing of $109.7 million, net of offering costs, and $0.2 million in proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by $2.1 million in payments for deferred offering costs associated with our initial public offering.\nLoan and Security Agreement\nIn May 2019, we entered into the Pacific Western Loan Agreement pursuant to which we may request advances on a $50.0 million Revolving Line. The maturity date of the Revolving Line is May 15, 2022. The Revolving Line bears interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 1.25% below the prime rate then in effect, or (ii) 4.25% at all times when we maintain a daily balance of cash in our demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million, and the greater of (i) 0.25% above the prime rate then in effect; or (ii) 5.75% at all times when we do not maintain a daily balance of cash in demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million; provided that, we are permitted to maintain a bank account with a non-affiliated bank in the United Kingdom so long as the account balance does not exceed 1.5 million GBP or its U.S. dollar equivalent at any time, pursuant to the PWB Amendment. We are required to pay a fee in an amount equal to 0.50% per annum of the unused portion of the Revolving Line each quarter, or the Unused Fee. The Unused Fee shall be waived for any quarter in which we maintain a daily balance of cash in our demand deposit account at PWB of at least $25.0 million at all times during such quarter. If the Revolving Line is terminated prior to the maturity date, we are required to pay an early termination fee equal to 1.0% of the Revolving Line.\nUnder the terms of the Pacific Western Loan Agreement, we granted PWB a security interest in substantially all of our assets, excluding any of the intellectual property now or hereafter owned, (but including any rights to payment from the sale or licensing of any such intellectual property). We must maintain an aggregate balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand at PWB (or PWB's affiliates) at least equal to any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line and any other outstanding obligations the we have to PWB. The agreement was amended in December 2019 to allow a bank account with a non-affiliated bank in the United Kingdom provided that the account balance does not exceed 1.5 million GBP or its U.S. dollar equivalent at any time.\nThe Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants (affirmative and negative), and includes standard events of default, including in the event of a material adverse change. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, PWB may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as are set forth in the loan and security agreement and increase the interest rate otherwise applicable to the amount outstanding under the Revolving Line by an additional 3.00%.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our Revolving Line, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants, under the Pacific Western Loan Agreement.\nFunding Requirements\nOur operating expenses increased substantially in 2019 and are expected to increase substantially in the future in connection with the initiation of additional human clinical trials and capital expenditures for MCAT.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2021. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical and agricultural products, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the progress, costs and results of our clinical development for our CD19, CD20, and BCMA programs as we initiate and progress clinical trials, including CRO costs; \n \u2022 the progress, costs and results of our additional research and preclinical development programs; \n \u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of internal process development and manufacturing scale-up activities and contract with CMOs associated with our CD19, CD20, and BCMA programs and other programs we advance through preclinical and clinical development; \n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of any product candidates that we may derive from ARCUS or any other product candidates we may develop alone or with collaborators; \n \u2022 the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims; and \n \u2022 the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval. \nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings, collaboration agreements, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and/or distribution arrangements.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, shareholders' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, product development and research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019:\n\n (1) Represents future minimum lease payments under our operating leases for office and/or lab space at the following locations: 302 East Pettigrew Street, Durham, North Carolina expiring in July 2024, 3054 Cornwallis Road, Durham, North Carolina expiring in April 2026 and 20 TW Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina expiring in August 2027 (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these lease agreements). \n (2) We have entered into a license agreement with an undisclosed licensee for intellectual property used in our research programs. The agreement requires us to pay annual license fees and milestones payments for achievement of specified clinical and commercial events. We have excluded these potential milestone payments in the contractual obligations table because the timing and likelihood of these contingent payments are not currently known and would be difficult to predict or estimate. \n (3) This table does not reflect principal and interest payments payable pursuant to our Pacific Western Loan Agreement. which we entered into in May 2019, pursuant to which we may request advances on a revolving line of credit of up to an aggregate principal of $50.0 million, or the Revolving Line. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under our Revolving Line. The maturity date of the Revolving Line is May 15, 2022. The Revolving Line bears interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 1.25% below the prime rate then in effect, or (ii) 4.25% at all times when we maintain a daily balance of cash in our demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million, and the greater of (i) 0.25% above the prime rate then in effect; or (ii) 5.75% at all times when we do not maintain a daily balance of cash in demand deposit accounts at PWB of at least $25.0 million. The Pacific Western Loan Agreement requires that we pay a quarterly fee in an amount equal to 0.50% per annum of the unused portion of the Revolving Line. The unused fee shall be waived for any quarter we maintain a daily balance in our demand deposit accounts of at least $25.0 million. If the Revolving Line is terminated prior to the maturity date, we are required to pay an early termination fee equal to 1.0% of the Revolving Line. \nIn addition, we have entered into the Duke License, under which we are obligated to make aggregate future milestone payments of up to $0.2 million upon the achievement of specified corporate milestones as well as low-single digit percent royalty payments based on future net sales of applicable products and generally mid-teen percent royalties based on sublicensing revenue. See Business-License and Collaboration Agreements\u201d for more information regarding our payment obligations under the Duke License. We have not included future payments under the Duke License in the table above since the payment obligations under the Duke License are contingent upon future events, such as the achievement of specified milestones or generating product sales, and we are unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving these milestones or generating future product sales.\nWe also enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs, universities and other third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the table above as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research, license, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales. We classify payments received under these agreements as revenues within our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605\u201d). ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nAt contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we evaluate the performance obligations promised in the contract that are based on goods and services that will be transferred to the customer and determine whether those obligations are both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the contract. Goods or services that meet these criteria are considered distinct performance obligations. If both these criteria are not met, the goods and services are combined into a single performance obligation. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and, if so, these options are considered performance obligations. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nWe recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time this is based on the use of an output or input method.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue within current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue - noncurrent. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet received or invoiced are generally recognized as contract assets in the Other line item in our consolidated balance sheets.\nMilestone Payments - If an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nRoyalties - For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor relationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\nSignificant Financing Component - In determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assessed each of our revenue arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nCollaborative Arrangements - We have entered into collaboration agreements, which are within the scope of ASC 606, to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple promises or obligations, which may include: (1) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to use our technology, (2) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaboration partner, and (3) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical and clinical material. Payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; clinical and development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASU No. 2018-18 Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and, therefore, are within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above.\nIn February 2016, we entered into the Servier Agreement for the licensing of our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform and the research, development, and manufacturing of product for clinical trials and commercialization of products. In September 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Gilead, which we refer to as the Gilead Agreement, to develop genome editing tools using our ARCUS proprietary genome editing platform. Both agreements use our genome editing technology for the treatment of certain diseases. Consideration we received, or may receive, under these collaboration and license agreements include upfront nonrefundable payments, research funding payments and payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales.\nUnder the guidance of ASC 606, certain judgments affect revenue recognition. Our primary performance obligations under our agreements consist of research and development services. Measuring the amount of time it takes for us to complete these services includes estimating our total effort to satisfy our performance obligations at the outset of the agreement and then comparing that amount to the actual effort expended for a given accounting period. In certain instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the timing of satisfying these obligations and timing may change due to efforts beyond our control, such as changes in the customer's direction of a particular research program or changes to the contractual terms of an agreement. Accordingly, our estimates may change in the future. Such changes to estimates will result in a change in prospective revenue recognition amounts.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to the following:\n \u2022 CROs and other third parties in connection with performing research and development activities, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf; \n \u2022 Vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and \n \u2022 CMOs and other vendors in connection with product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical supplies. \nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials and CMOs that manufacture product for our research and development activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may cause us to report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other share-based awards granted to our employees, directors, consultants and advisors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards, net of actual forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. As we have limited trading history, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded share price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing a weighted value considering actual history and estimated expected term based on the midpoint of final vest date and expiration date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. The JOBS Act also exempts us from having to provide an auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b).\nWe will remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_tables": "Table 343: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td>

"The report discusses the financial condition and operational results of a life sciences company that specializes in genome editing through its ARCUS platform. The company develops product candidates for human diseases, sustainable food, and agriculture. It's pursuing three main areas: allogeneic CAR T cell immunotherapy, in vivo gene correction, and innovation in food production.\n\nThe company's clinical trials include PBCAR0191, an allogeneic CAR T therapy targeting CD19 for B-cell cancers, which is in Phase 1/2a and shows promise with no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities so far. PBCAR0191 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA. Additionally, other trials are planned or underway for therapies targeting CD20 and BCMA.\n\nThe company operates through two segments: Therapeutics and Food, each focusing on applying their genome editing technology in their respective fields. Collaborations are essential to their strategy, with two significant agreements mentioned: one with Gilead for Hepatitis B treatments and another with Servier for up to six antigen targets, including PBCAR0191. Both agreements provide the company with upfront payments, research funding, milestone payments, and royalties.\n\nFinancially, the company has incurred substantial losses since its inception in 2006 and has not generated any product sales revenue. They completed an IPO on April 2019, raising significant funds. The company expects to continue incurring losses and increase operational expenses as they expand product development. The company's strategy for funding these expenses includes further public equity, debt financing, and collaborations.\n\nRegarding accounting policies, revenue recognition is complex, involving estimates of future milestones and royalties from partnerships. Share-based compensation costs are significant and require careful estimation as well. An emerging growth company, they benefit from reduced reporting requirements and have chosen the extended transition period for new or revised accounting standards.\n\nFinally, the company has not engaged in any off-balance sheet financing and will remain an emerging growth company until specific financial milestones are met.\n\nThis MD&A stresses that the company's future success is uncertain, relies on the successful development and marketing of its product candidates, and is subject to various risks including the need for additional funding, which might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all."}
