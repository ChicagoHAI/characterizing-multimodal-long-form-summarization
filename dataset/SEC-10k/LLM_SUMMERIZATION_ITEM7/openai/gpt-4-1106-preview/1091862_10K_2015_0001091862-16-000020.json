The forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed. Forward-looking information is intended to reflect opinions as of the date this Form 10-K was filed. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements to conform the statements to actual results or changes in our operations.\nOUR BUSINESS\nWe are a global, United States publicly traded specialty chemical company dedicated to delivering innovative, performance-driven engineered specialty chemical solutions which are used as additives, ingredients or intermediates that add value to our customers' end products. We are committed to global sustainability through greener technology\u201d and developing engineered chemical solutions that meet our customers' evolving needs. We operate in a wide variety of end-use industries, including automotive, building and construction, electronics, lubricants, packaging and transportation. We are a leader in many of our key product lines and transact business in approximately 90 countries. Our principal executive offices are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Middlebury, Connecticut.\nDuring 2013 and 2014, through a series of divestitures, we transformed ourselves from a diversified specialty chemical company into a company primarily serving the global industrial specialty chemical market.\nPrior to 2015 as part of our transformational initiatives, we divested several businesses that did not fit with our strategic objectives. In November 2014, we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform Specialty Products Corporation (\"Platform\"). The sale included the stock of certain subsidiaries, the dedicated manufacturing plants located at Gajraula, India and Pekin, Illinois, working capital and certain other assets as well as the assumption of certain liabilities. In December 2013, we completed the sale of our subsidiaries dedicated to the Consumer Products business to KIK Custom Products Inc. (\"KIK\"). The assets of those subsidiaries included dedicated manufacturing plants in the U.S. and South Africa. In April 2013, we completed an asset sale of our antioxidant and UV Stabilizer (the \"Antioxidant\") business to SK Blue Holdings, Ltd. (\"SK\") and Addivant USA Holdings Corp. (\"Addivant\"). The sale included dedicated manufacturing plants in the U.S., France, and Germany, and joint venture interests in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Korea. A further description of these transactions are provided in Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnder the terms of the sale agreement with Platform, we retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and have continued to manufacture products for Platform under several supply agreements and a tolling agreement (collectively, the supply agreements\u201d). The supply agreements have minimum terms of between two and four years. To reflect the change in the nature of operations, we changed the name of our Chemtura AgroSolutions segment to Agrochemical Manufacturing after the sale in 2014.\nOur commitment to this strategic change required us to reevaluate our remaining operations and management structure as well as our ability to increase operating efficiencies, reduce costs and increase value to our shareholders. In addition to the divestiture of our non-strategic businesses, in the fourth quarter of 2014, our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") approved a restructuring plan (the \"2014 Restructuring Plan\") to eliminate the stranded costs associated with our Chemtura AgroSolutions business, streamline the costs of our manufacturing operations and align our remaining operations and management structure for operating efficiencies designed to increase our business operating income and cash flows and build a platform for future organic growth. A further description of this restructuring initiative is provided in Note 3 - Restructuring and Asset Impairment Activities.\nWe entered 2015 a transformed company. We are comprised of two strategic business reporting segments, Industrial Performance Products and Industrial Engineered Products which, coupled with our Corporate reporting segment, are collectively referred to as our \"Core Segments\". In addition to our Core Segments, our Agrochemical Manufacturing reporting segment represents the ongoing activity with Platform under the supply agreements.\nThe primary economic factors that influence the operations and net sales of our Industrial Performance Products ( Industrial Performance\u201d) and Industrial Engineered Products ( Industrial Engineered\u201d) segments (collectively referred to as Industrials\u201d) are demand conditions in industrial, electronics, energy, residential and commercial construction, and transportation markets. Other factors affecting our financial performance include industry capacity, customer demand, raw material and energy costs, and sales prices. Sales prices are influenced by the global demand and supply for the products we produce, our ability to innovate and differentiate our products and competitor behavior. We seek to pursue sales prices that reflect the value our products deliver to our customers, while aiming to pass on higher raw material and energy costs to our customers to preserve our profit margins. The risks that may impact our performance are included in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE\nIn 2015, we substantially delivered on our commitments we had established for our transformed company despite being a smaller company and encountering some headwinds in the supply of certain raw materials and sluggish market demand conditions. Among the many accomplishments in 2015 were:\nImprovement Initiatives\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We announced in late 2014 a cost reduction program to deliver $62 million annualized incurred cost savings indicating we would realize $50 million of savings in 2015. We delivered on that commitment and achieved our \"run-rate\" savings in incurred costs in the third quarter of 2015 although part of the benefit was offset by the absorption effect of lower sales volume.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We promptly eliminated the stranded costs associated with our former Chemtura AgroSolutions business. We also completed the closure of our West Lafayette, Indiana and Adrian, Michigan facilities. These actions together with the manufacturing and SG&A cost reduction program substantially completed the 2014 Restructuring Plan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We increased the percentage of operating income to net sales in our Industrial Performance and Industrial Engineered segments by 520 basis points and 600 basis points, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared with prior year end despite a reduction in net sales for the same periods. The improvement came from the benefits of our cost reduction actions and from \"price-over-raw material costs\", among other factors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We demonstrated substantial improvements in cash flow.

As a result of holding the shares, which were accounted for as available for sale securities, we reported a net gain of $3 million in the second quarter of 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur management discussion and analysis of our results of operations relates to our business from continuing operations.\nThe sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business in November 2014 did not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation and, therefore, our results from continuing operations includes the historical financial information of that business through the date of sale. Given the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform in 2014, a discussion of the results of operations for the consolidated company for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is less meaningful to investors due to the sale and the change in the nature of the operations associated with our Agrochemical Manufacturing business from a market participant to a supplier of products to Platform under the supply agreements.\nWe determined that the most effective way to present to investors the change in results of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, as well as the comparison for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended December 31, 2013, is to provide separate discussions of the changes in our consolidated results for the Core Segments and then separately for the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment.\nUnder the headings \"2015 Compared to 2014\" and \"2014 Compared to 2013,\" we are providing a table which presents the results of operations of the consolidated Company including the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment through operating income. The table then segregates the results of operations for our Core Segments and our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment. The discussion of the components of operating income included in the section titled Overview only reflect changes related to the Core Segments. A separate discussion regarding the changes in results of operations of the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment is presented in each section under the heading Agrochemical Manufacturing\u201d.\nComponents of net income which are not included in operating income are affected by other factors in addition to the inconsistency in the results of operations after the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. We therefore have not included net income in the tables. As a result, the comparison discussions for the changes in those components which are not part of operating income are presented for the Company as a whole.\nFor a further discussion on the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business and the ongoing supply agreements with Platform, as well as the sale of our Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, see Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2015 COMPARED TO 2014\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agrochemical\n</td> <td>Core\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agrochemical\n</td> <td>Core\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>Segments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>Segments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility closures, severance and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) - Excludes depreciation and amortization expense which are shown separately.\nOverview\nConsolidated net sales of our Core Segments were $1.6 billion in 2015 or $179 million lower than in 2014 due to lower sales volume of $129 million, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38 million and lower sales prices of $12 million.\nThe larger portion of the decline in sales volume was attributable to our Industrial Engineered segment. Our Industrial Performance segment also reflected some sales volume declines as well as the effects of unfavorable product mix as compared with 2014. Our Industrial Engineered segment reported a decline in overall volume, despite volume improvement in the sales of our Emerald Innovation 3000\u2122 product used in the manufacture of insulation foam for building and construction applications and in clear brine fluids used in oilfield applications. However, due to the impact of a strike at a supplier of elemental bromine in the first half of 2015 and the disruptions in the import and export of hazardous materials in China as a result of the fire at the Tianjin, China port, we experienced a decline in sales volumes for our elemental bromine-based products and products used in energy and electronic applications. Additionally, decreased demand for flame retardant products used in furniture foam applications and the discontinuance of certain products late in 2014 and in 2015 led to further sales volume declines. Our Industrial Performance segment also experienced a decline in overall sales volume; however, unfavorable product mix particularly in the automotive, power generation, mining, oil and gas application products was a primary driver of lower net sales. Increased overall sales prices in our Industrial Engineered segment products were offset by sales price declines\nin our Industrial Performance segment due to our obligation to pass along the reductions in raw material costs resulting from lower oil prices to certain customers under formula based pricing contracts. Throughout 2015, we experienced the unfavorable effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar compared to other major currencies which reduced the U.S. Dollar value of our net sales denominated in foreign currencies.\nGross profit for our Core Segments in 2015 was $393 million, an increase of $49 million compared to $344 million in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 24% in 2015 compared with 19% in 2014. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to lower raw material costs resulting from lower oil prices, lower manufacturing costs as a result of our cost reduction initiatives, lower distribution costs and favorable foreign currency translation, partly offset by lower sales volume, unfavorable product mix and lower sales prices and a charge of $8 million related to an increase in our inventory reserves for a discontinued product.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense of $150 million was $45 million lower than 2014. Our SG&A for 2014 included a $21 million one-time charge related to the settlement of pension obligations and $18 million of expenses we incurred in connection with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. The remaining reduction in SG&A expense from 2014 is the result of our various cost savings initiatives that we announced at the end of 2014, including the elimination of stranded costs associated with our Chemtura AgroSolutions business, offset in part by higher cost accruals under our employee benefit and management incentive plans in 2015 compared to last year due to our improved performance.\nFacility closures, severance and related costs in 2015 were $3 million compared with $25 million for 2014. The expense related to the cost reduction initiatives we announced in 2014 and 2013. The restructuring plans in 2014 and 2015 related to both the elimination of stranded costs associated with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Consumer Products and Antioxidant businesses as well as initiatives to reduce manufacturing and SG&A costs within our Industrials businesses. Our restructuring plans are described in more detail in Note 3 - Restructuring and Assets Impairment Activities of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe loss on sale of business of $4 million in 2015 and the gain on sale of business of $529 million in 2014 are related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform in 2014 and the settlement of working capital adjustments and finalization of other post-closing terms of the sale and purchase agreement in 2015.\nOther Non-Operating Income and Expense\nThe following discussion about income and expense components that are not included in the computation of operating income are presented on a total company basis, which is the sum of the Core Segments and the Agrochemical Manufacturing Segment.\nInterest expense of $30 million during 2015 was $15 million lower than 2014, primarily the result of our repayments of debt utilizing net after-tax cash proceeds from the sale of Chemtura AgroSolutions.\nLoss on the early extinguishment of debt of $7 million for 2014 included a call premium and the write-off of unamortized capitalized financing costs and original issuance discount.\nOther income, net was $20 million for 2015 compared with $12 million for 2014. Other income, net in 2015 included a gain of $8 million related to the release of cumulative translation adjustments associated with the rationalization of certain European subsidiaries that were no longer required and a gain of $3 million related to the sale of the Platform shares. The remaining activity primarily reflected realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses, most significantly related to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies which began in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nThe income tax expense in 2015 was $16 million compared with a benefit of $192 million in 2014. The tax benefit reported in 2014 included a release of U.S. valuation allowance in the amount of $406 million and the tax expense related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. In 2014, we concluded that the positive evidence that we can utilize our U.S. deferred tax assets before they expire outweighed the negative evidence and as a result we released a majority of our U.S. valuation allowance.\nEarnings from continuing operations for 2015 was $136 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, as compared with $771 million, or $8.43 per diluted share in 2014. The after tax gain on the sale of Chemtura AgroSolutions and the tax benefit from the release of the majority of the valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets were the largest contributors to diluted earnings per share in 2014.\nEarnings from discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, which related to the Consumer Products business.\nLoss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, which primarily represented post-closing adjustments and obligations, settlement of

<table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Price over raw materials is the sum of the net changes in sales prices and the net changes in raw material costs between the two periods. As the reduction in the costs of certain raw materials result in certain circumstances in reductions in sales prices under certain contractual and negotiated agreements, the change in sales prices net of changes in raw material costs provides a better measure of the impact of sales price changes on our profitability (referred to as \"price over raw materials\").\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The following is a discussion of the results of our segments for 2015 compared with 2014.\nIndustrial Performance Products\nOur Industrial Performance segment reported higher operating income on lower net sales for 2015 as compared with 2014.\nThe decline in net sales resulted from changes in product mix predominantly in our petroleum additive products coupled with overall lower sales volume in both petroleum additive and urethane product lines. Net sales further declined due to overall lower average sales prices, the result of lower raw material costs and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. As\n2015 progressed, we felt the effects of lower demand as our customer's began to manage inventory as demand in mining and oil and gas application products weakened. This weakening effected our product mix as we retained a higher volume of some of our lower margin products. Net sales were further impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies resulting in the value of net sales in foreign currency translating to lower U.S. Dollar sales in 2015 as compared with 2014. Overall lower sales prices particularly for our petroleum additive products were principally the result of our contractual and negotiated agreements that in certain circumstances result in reductions in sales prices when certain raw material costs decline.\nDespite the reduction in net sales, operating income compared with 2014 was $35 million higher due to the benefit of our ability to hold sales prices for our more specialty products, lower raw material and manufacturing costs and lower SG&A and research and development (\"R&D\", collectively, SGA&R\u201d) expense primarily the result of implementing many of the cost reduction initiatives we announced in 2014. The changes in foreign exchange rates provided a net benefit due to the location of our manufacturing footprint such that the reduction in foreign currency denominated production and administrative costs in U.S. dollar terms more than offset the unfavorable translation of foreign currency denominated net sales. These benefits more than offset the impacts of unfavorable volume and product mix described above.\nIndustrial Engineered Products\nOur Industrial Engineered segment reported lower net sales but higher operating income for 2015 compared with 2014.\nThe decline in net sales was primarily related to a decline in overall volume and product mix offset in part by increases in average sales prices. We experienced lower sales volume in our flame retardant products used in energy and electronic applications and in flexible urethane foams used in furniture applications coupled with a reduction in bromine products used in fine chemical applications offset in part by increases in demand for our Emerald Innovation 3000\u2122 product used in insulation foam applications in building and construction and clear brine fluids used in oilfield applications. The growth in net sales of clear brine fluids occurred despite the overall decline in oil and gas exploration in 2015. This is likely due to the timing of the completion of the deep water drilling projects in which our products are used and may not be indicative of future net sales for these products in these applications.\nDuring the first half of 2015, we experienced an interruption in the supply of elemental bromine due to a strike at a third-party supplier. While the strike ended early in the third quarter, it took until the end of the year for supply to fully recover. The fire and explosion at the Tianjin, China port in August caused disruptions to the import and export of hazardous materials in China which led to unfavorable volume impacts on certain of our products. Additionally, the discontinuance of sales of certain phosphorus-based flame products toward the end of 2014 and the discontinuation of sales of certain bromine based biocides when we closed our Adrian, MI manufacturing facility in June 2015 resulted in further sales volume declines year-over-year. Sales prices for our bromine and bromine derivative products started to recover as 2015 progressed, particularly for electronic flame retardant applications. This benefit was offset in part by unfavorable currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies in 2015.\nThe benefit of our cost savings initiatives and the increase in sales prices offset the reduction in net sales. In 2015, we generated $58 million in operating profit, a $42 million increase over 2014. The effect of sales volume declines on operating income were offset by the benefit of \"price over raw material\" costs, lower manufacturing and distribution costs and lower SGA&R. Operating profit in 2015 was impacted by an $8 million charge to increase our inventory reserves for a discontinued product. By the third quarter of 2015, we had realized the full benefit of our cost reduction initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2014, although part of that benefit was offset by the absorption effects of lower sales volume and the increase in our inventory reserves.\nCorporate\nIncluded in our general corporate expenses are costs of a general nature or managed on a corporate basis. These costs, net of allocations to the business segments, primarily represent corporate stewardship and administration activities together with costs associated with legacy activities and intangible asset amortization. Functional costs are allocated between the business segments and general corporate expense.\nCorporate expense was $64 million and $93 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which included amortization expense related to intangible assets and depreciation expense of $14 million and $16 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively. Our 2014 corporate expense included a one-time charge for $21 million in 2014 related to the settlement of a pension obligation and $18 million of non-recurring costs related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. The remaining increase in corporate expense in 2015 is the result of higher accruals under our employee benefit and management incentive plans in 2015 compared\nto last year due to improved performance coupled with higher accruals for environmental obligations and project costs partly offset by lower costs as a result of our cost savings initiatives.\nAgrochemical Manufacturing\nIn the first ten months of 2014, our Chemtura AgroSolutions business manufactured and resold agrochemical products to third party distributors and customers. In November 2014, we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform. Under the terms of the sale agreement with Platform, we retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and are continuing to manufacture products for Platform under the supply agreements. We operated under the supply agreements for the two months ended December 31, 2014 and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Therefore, the results of operations in 2014 are not comparable to the result of operations in 2015. In light of the incomparability, we have only provided discussion on the results of operations for 2015 and the net sales and operating profit of this segment prior to the sale in 2014.\nSupply Agreement Results\nThe supply agreements with Platform are designed to recover the actual cash costs incurred to manufacture the products under the agreements. Accordingly, the supply agreements are considered below-market contracts for their full term. Contemporaneous with the sale, we accrued in 2014 an obligation of $230 million, on a discounted basis, which represents the loss of profit on these products over the terms of the supply agreements, including contractual obligations to continue supply for a period of up to 2 years after termination of the supply agreements. The recognition of the obligation, along with the accretion of the obligation to its undiscounted value of $345 million, will be recorded as net sales on a straight-line basis over the term of each supply agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment net sales were $137 million, which included $38 million related to the recognition of our fulfillment of the obligation, net of accretion related to the below-market supply agreements. For the two month period ended December 31, 2014, the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment net sales were $22 million, which included $6 million related to the recognition of our fulfillment of the obligation, net of accretion related to the below-market supply agreements.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $35 million compared with $6 million for the two months ended December 31, 2014. As the contracts were designed to recover a majority of the costs incurred, operating income reflected the recognition of the obligation, net of accretion, related to the below market contract, less a small amount of depreciation and amortization that is not included as part of the recoverable costs.\nPrevious Results of the Chemtura AgroSolutions Business (Pre-Divestiture)\nNet sales of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business for the ten months ended October 31, 2014 were $381 million and operating income was $80 million.\n2014 COMPARED TO 2013\nOverview\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agrochemical\n</td> <td>Core\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agrochemical\n</td> <td>Core\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>Segments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>Segments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility closures, severance and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity (income) loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) - Excludes depreciation and amortization expense which are shown separately.\nOverview\nConsolidated net sales of our Core Segments were $1.8 billion in 2014 or $5 million higher than in 2013 driven by a $12 million increase in volume which was offset in part by a $4 million reduction in average sales prices and $3 million related to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. Our Industrial Performance segment reported an increase in sales which represented an increase in volume of our polyester polyols and sales price increases of our petroleum additive products offset by volume declines in our intermediate, detergents and inhibitor products. Our Industrial Engineered segment reported a decline in sales due to competition reducing sales prices for a number of our product lines and the decline in demand for our flexible foam application products weakened as the year progressed unfavorably impacting volume. Our Industrial Engineered segment delivered improvement in volume of our brominated performance products which was offset in part by declines in sales volumes for our polymerization co-catalysts products.\nGross profit for our Core Segments in 2014 was $344 million, an increase of $8 million compared to $336 million in 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of sales remained stable at 19% for both years. Gross profit in dollars increased due to the absence of a $21 million charge we took in 2013 related to costs to remediate a legacy non-operating site in France. Our gross profit was unfavorably impacted by the decrease in sales prices, an increase in raw material, distribution and manufacturing costs, and unfavorable product mix offset by the elimination of stranded costs associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses and other cost savings initiatives.\nSG&A expense of $195 million was $27 million higher than in 2013, primarily the result of a $21 million charge related to the settlement of pension obligations, $12 million of additional costs in 2014 associated with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business (exclusive of the amounts reported as part of the gain on sale) and $9 million in costs associated with our investment in business excellence initiatives. This was partially offset by $3 million in other pension matters primarily related to the absence of one-time charges that were recorded in 2013, a $3 million reduction in selling expense and the remainder in savings associated with the reduction of employee costs and benefits associated with our restructuring programs and the elimination of the stranded costs associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses.\nFacility closures, severance and related costs in 2014 was $25 million compared with $42 million for 2013. The expense related to the cost reduction initiatives we announced in 2014 and 2013. The restructuring plans related to both the elimination of stranded costs associated with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Consumer Products and Antioxidant businesses as well as initiatives to reduce manufacturing and SG&A costs within our Industrials businesses. Our restructuring plans are described in more detail in Note 3 - Restructuring and Assets Impairment Activities of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe gain on sale of business of $529 million in 2014 represented the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform.\nOther Non-Operating Income and Expense\nThe following discussion about income and expense outside of operating income is presented on a total company basis, which is the sum of the Core Segments and the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment.\nInterest expense of $45 million during 2014 was $15 million lower than 2013 due to our debt refinancing actions taken in the second half of 2013. The full benefit of our fourth quarter 2014 redemption of the outstanding 2018 Senior Notes and the pay down of the Term Loan due 2016 (the \"Term Loan\") are reflected in our 2015 results.\nLoss on the early extinguishment of debt of $7 million for 2014 included a call premium and the write-off of unamortized capitalized financing costs and original issuance discount. Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $50 million for 2013 included the difference between the principal amount of the 2018 Senior Notes tendered and the sum of the tender offer consideration and consent payments and the write-off of unamortized capitalized financing costs and original issuance discount.\nOther income, net was $12 million for 2014 compared with $8 million for 2013. Other income, net primarily reflected the net impact of foreign exchange gains and losses. In 2014, we realized foreign exchange gains and losses on the repayment of several foreign denominated intercompany loans between our subsidiaries in addition to significant fluctuations in the Euro and British Pound Sterling. In addition, during 2013, we recognized a gain of $13 million related to the release of cumulative translation adjustments associated with the rationalization of certain European subsidiaries that are no longer required.\nThe income tax benefit in 2014 was $192 million compared with expense of $18 million in 2013. The tax benefit reported in 2014 included a release of U.S. valuation allowance in the amount of $406 million and the tax expense related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. In 2014, we concluded that the positive evidence that we can utilize our U.S. deferred tax\nassets before they expire outweighed the negative evidence and as a result we released a majority of our U.S. valuation allowance. In 2013, tax expense was related to taxable income of certain of our international subsidiaries. In 2013, we provided a full valuation allowance against the tax expense associated with our U.S. net operating loss.\nEarnings from continuing operations for 2014 was $771 million, or $8.43 per diluted share, as compared with a loss from continuing operations of $22 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in 2013.\nEarnings from discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared with $25 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for 2013. Discontinued operations in 2013 represented the results of operations of our Antioxidants business through its sale in April 2013 and our Consumer Products business through its sale in December 2013. Additionally, in 2013, we recorded an impairment charge of $7 million which included the impairment of property, plant and equipment related to the Consumer Products business.\nLoss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $9 million, or $0.10, per diluted share. The loss represented customary working capital adjustments of $1 million and $8 million associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products divestitures, respectively. Loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax for 2013, was $180 million, or $1.84, per diluted share which represented a net loss of $155 million and $25 million associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, respectively.\nThe following table describes the major factors impacting net sales and operating income for each of our segments:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td>

the sum of the net changes in sales prices and the net changes in raw material costs between the two periods. As the reduction in the costs of certain raw materials result in certain circumstances in reductions in sales prices under certain contractual and negotiated agreements, the change in sales prices net of\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nchanges in raw material costs provides a better measure of the impact of sales price changes on our profitability (referred to as \"price over raw materials\").\nThe following is a discussion of the results of our segments for 2014 compared with 2013.\nIndustrial Performance Products\nOur Industrial Performance segment reported higher net sales and lower operating income in 2014 compared with 2013.\nWe experienced overall volume declines in our intermediate, inhibitor and detergent petroleum additive products which was more than offset by volume improvement in our synthetic basestocks for finished fluid applications, Adiprene\u00ae/Vibrathane\u00ae products and polyester polyols. Net sales price increases were unable to offset the loss in volume. Overall sales price for our petroleum additive products was favorable to prior year but still fell short of covering increases in our raw material costs. Operating income reflected a favorable product mix of selling higher margin products than in 2013 which was offset in part by higher distribution and SGA&R.\nOperating income was $106 million in 2014, a decrease of $3 million compared with 2013. The decrease reflected higher raw material costs, an increase in SGA&R costs and additional accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment, offset by higher sales volume and favorable product mix, higher sales prices and favorable foreign currency translation.\nIndustrial Engineered Products\nOur Industrial Engineered segment reported lower net sales and operating income in 2014 compared with 2013.\nDuring 2014, we felt the effects of excess industry capacity in bromine and in polymerization co-catalysts products (\"PCC\"). The resulting competition driven by excess supply drove a reduction in our sales prices and resulted in lower volumes. We saw growth in the sales of our Emerald Innovation 3000TM products as customers switched to this alternative from traditional HBCD flame retardant styrene based insulation foam applications coupled with increased volume from international markets for our clear brine fluids used in energy markets partly offset the reductions in bromine based products and PCC volumes. Demand for flexible foam flame retardant products declined as the year progressed resulting in lower volumes. Towards the end of the year, sales prices for bromine products stabilized, but sales prices did not recover to 2013 levels. While we experienced a decrease in our raw material costs, the benefit was offset by the decline in sales prices, increase in sales of lower margin products, higher manufacturing and other costs and higher SGA&R expenses.\nOperating income of $16 million in 2014 decreased $39 million compared with last year. The decrease reflected unfavorable volume and product mix, lower sales prices, higher SGA&R costs, unfavorable foreign currency translation, higher distribution costs and an increase in other costs, offset by a decrease in raw material costs.\nCorporate\nCorporate expense was $93 million and $112 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, which included amortization expense related to intangible assets and depreciation expense of $16 million and $18 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively. Included in corporate expense in 2013 was a charge of $21 million to increase an environmental reserve for the costs to remediate a legacy non-operating site in France. Included in corporate expense in 2014 is a charge for $21 million related to the settlement of a pension obligation, an additional $12 million of costs incurred in the exploration and sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business over 2013, exclusive of the amount reported as part of the gain on sale, offset by $24 million related to the elimination of stranded costs associated with our Chemtura AgroSolutions business in 2014 and our Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses which were sold in 2013.\nAgrochemical Manufacturing\nIn 2013 and for the first ten months of 2014, our Chemtura AgroSolutions business manufactured and resold agrochemical products to third party distributors and customers. In November 2014, we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform. Under the terms of the sale agreement with Platform, we have retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and will continue to manufacture products for Platform under the supply agreements. We operated under the supply agreements for the two months ended December 31, 2014. Therefore, the results of operations for the previous Chemtura AgroSolutions business is not comparable to the Agrochemical Manufacturing business. The following represents a discussion of the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment on a go-forward basis and of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business on a pre-sale basis compared with 2013.\nSupply Agreement Results\nFor the two month period ended December 31, 2014, the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment's net sales were $22 million, which included $6 million related to the recognition of our fulfillment of the obligation, net of accretion related to the below-market supply agreements.\nOperating income for the two months ended December 31, 2014 was $6 million. As the contracts were designed to recover a majority of the costs incurred, operating income reflects only the recognition of the obligation,net of accretion, related to the below market contract, less a small amount of depreciation and amortization that is not included as part of the recoverable costs.\nPrevious Results of the Chemtura AgroSolutions Business (Pre-Divestiture)\nNet sales of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business for the ten months ended October 31, 2014 were $381 million as compared with net sales of $449 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $371 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. Operating profit for the ten months ended October 31, 2014 was $80 million compared with $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $74 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.\nThe Chemtura AgroSolutions business did not have any third party sales subsequent to the date of sale to Platform. Therefore, to assist investors in understanding the business and its results of operations prior to the date of sale, the discussion that follows compares the first ten months of 2014 with the first ten months of 2013.\nChemtura AgroSolutions generated higher net sales and operating income for the first ten months of 2014 as compared with the same ten months of 2013. Net sales increased $10 million representing an $8 million increase in volume and a $10 million increase in sales price which was offset by $8 million in unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. Chemtura AgroSolutions experienced strong demand in Latin America due both to a high level of demand for pest control in the soybean market and the growth in cultivated acreage. Our European region experienced favorable weather conditions in Europe toward the end of the first half of 2014. There was some supply constraints on certain miticides in North America which offset some of the volume growth in the first half of 2014. Overall higher volumes and improved sales prices offset the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.\nOperating income increased $6 million primarily reflecting the benefit of favorable volume and product mix changes of $18 million and $10 million of increased sales prices offset in part by $9 million in higher SGA&R due primarily to an increase in our bad debt reserves related to certain customers in Brazil and Kazakhstan, $4 million in higher raw material, manufacturing and distribution costs and $7 million of unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation.\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not calculated or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). While we believe that such measures are useful in evaluating our performance, investors should not consider them to be a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the financial measures may differ from similarly titled financial measures used by other companies and do not provide a comparable view of our performance relative to other companies in similar industries. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015, 2014 and 2013 is calculated as follows:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operational facility closures, severance and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agrochemical Manufacturing supply agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs associated with the sale of Chemtura AgroSolutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UK pension benefit matter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe believe that our cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under our U.S. and international credit facilities and our current cash and cash equivalents provide sufficient liquidity to maintain our current operations and capital expenditure requirements, repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, service our debt and pursue other strategic initiatives.\nThe following is a discussion on significant factors affecting our liquidity and use of capital resources.\nFinancing Facilities\nOur financing facilities are comprised of public debt, several loans and a revolving line of credit.\nSenior Notes\nIn July 2013, we issued in a registered public offering $450 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Senior Notes\"). As of December 31, 2015, $450 million remained outstanding. The 2021 Senior Notes are callable at any time prior to July 2016 at 100% of their value plus a make-whole premium. After July 2016 the 2021 Senior Notes are callable at pre-determined fixed rates under the terms described in the 2021 Senior Notes indenture.\nLoans\nIn August 2010, we entered into a Term Loan due 2016 with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto, for an aggregate principal amount of $295 million. On October 31, 2012, we exercised the accordion feature of our Term Loan and borrowed an additional $125 million. Repayments were made on the Term Loan in 2013 and 2014 with proceeds from the 2021 Senior Notes offering, sale of businesses and cash on hand. In May 2015, we made an additional\nrepayment of $42 million. As of December 31, 2015, $40 million remained outstanding under the Term Loan, which is now classified as short term borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as it matures in August 2016.\nWe maintain a 5 year secured credit facility of CNY 250 million (approximately $40 million) available through December 2017 (the China Bank Facility\u201d) with Agricultural Bank of China, Nantong Branch ( ABC Bank\u201d). The China Bank Facility has been used for funding construction of our manufacturing facility in Nantong, China and is secured by land, property and machinery of our subsidiary Chemtura Advanced Materials (Nantong) Co., Ltd.. Repayments of principal are made in semi-annual installments from December 2014 through December 2017. In December 2014 and January 2015, we repaid $5 million and $15 million, respectively, of the China Bank Facility with proceeds from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. As of December 31, 2015, $12 million remained outstanding under the China Bank Facility.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nIn December 2013, we entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility that provides for $175 million available to our domestic subsidiaries (the \"US ABL Facility\") and \u20ac60 million available to Chemtura Sales Europe B.V., a Netherlands subsidiary (the Foreign ABL Facility\u201d, and together with the US ABL Facility, the 2018 ABL Facility\u201d), subject in each case to availability under a borrowing base. The 2018 ABL Facility provides a $125 million letter of credit sub-facility.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had no borrowings under the 2018 ABL Facility. However, we had $14 million of outstanding letters of credit (primarily related to insurance obligations, environmental obligations and banking credit facilities) which utilized available capacity under the facility. At December 31, 2015, based upon the available borrowing base, we had approximately $186 million of undrawn availability under the 2018 ABL Facility.\nCovenants\nThese financing facilities, excluding the China Bank Facility, contain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to enter into certain transactions, such as creating liens, incurring additional indebtedness or repaying certain indebtedness, making investments, paying dividends, and entering into acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the maintenance covenant requirements of these financing facilities.\nFor further discussion of the financing facilities, see Note 7 - Debt in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn October 2014, the Board approved a share repurchase authorization of up to $500 million conditioned upon the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. In August 2015, the Board authorized an increase to the October 2014 authorization by $150 million, up to $650 million in the aggregate when combined with the October 2014 authorization, and extended the program to December 1, 2016.\nDuring 2015, we purchased 6.2 million shares for $150 million under this share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2015, $171 million remained outstanding under our share repurchase program.\nA further discussion of our share repurchase programs is included in Note 10 - Capital Stock and Earnings (Loss) per Common Share in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe shares are expected to be repurchased from time to time through open market purchases. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at the Board's discretion. The manner, price, number and timing of such repurchases, if any, will be subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d).\nDivestitures and Other Sources of Cash\nChemtura AgroSolutions Business Divestiture and On-going Supply Arrangements\nIn November 2014, we completed the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform Specialty Products Corporation (\"Platform\") for approximately $1 billion, consisting of $950 million in cash and 2 million shares of Platform's common stock. The purchase price was subject to customary post-closing adjustments and related expenses which were finalized during 2015 and resulted in additional net proceeds of $3 million.\nThe net cash after-tax proceeds from this sale were used in part to pay for repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program, retire the remaining balance of our 2018 Senior Notes, pre-pay a portion of our Term Loan in December 2014 and pre-pay a portion of our China Facility in two tranches in December 2014 and January 2015.\nUnder the terms of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (\"SAPA\") with Platform, we have retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and have continued to manufacture products for Platform under several supply agreements and a tolling agreement (collectively, the \"supply agreements\"). The supply agreements have minimum terms of between two and four years.\nThe supply agreements with Platform are designed to recover the cash costs incurred to manufacture the products under the agreement. As such, the supply agreements are considered below-market contracts for their full term. In 2014 we recorded an obligation of $230 million, on a discounted basis, which represents the loss of profit on the sale of these products over the terms of the supply agreements, including contractual obligations to continue supply for a period of up to 2 years after the termination of the contracts. The recognition of the obligation, along with the accretion of the obligation to its undiscounted value of $345 million, is being recorded as net sales on a straight-line basis over the term of each supply agreement. Although the recognition of the obligation will be recorded as net sales to the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment over this period, this recognition will not generate cash flows during the term of the supply agreements. The change in this obligation that is included in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $38 million.\nFor further discussion of the Chemtura AgroSolutions sale, see Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Divestitures\nIn December 2013, we sold our wholly owned subsidiaries that constituted our Consumer Products business. The assets of these subsidiaries included dedicated manufacturing plants in the U.S. and South Africa, to KIK for $300 million and the assumption by KIK of pension and other liabilities totaling approximately $8 million. The Consumer Products business developed, manufactured and sold performance chemicals to consumers for in-home and outdoor use.\nIn April 2013, we sold substantially all the assets of our antioxidant business (the \"Antioxidant Sale\") to SK Blue Holdings, Ltd. ( SK\u201d), an affiliate of SK Capital Partners III, L.P., and Addivant USA Holding Corp. (Addivant\") for $97 million, $9 million in preferred stock issued by Addivant and the assumption by SK and Addivant of pension, environmental and other liabilities totaling approximately $91 million.\nFor further discussion of our Discontinued Operations, see Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Uses of Cash\nRestructuring Initiatives\nIn November 2014, the Board approved a restructuring plan to reduce manufacturing costs, eliminate stranded costs arising from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business and reduce SG&A costs. The main component of these actions was headcount reductions. The total cash costs approved by the Board to implement this plan was $37 million, of which we incurred $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 for severance and related costs and $2 million in 2015 for professional fees and severance related costs related to the closure of our West Lafayette, IN facility that was initiated in February 2015. We do not anticipate incurring the full $37 million of approved costs to complete the remaining actions in 2016 under this plan.\nIn June 2014, our Board approved the closure of the Adrian, MI facility, when an option given to KIK as part of the sale of our Consumer Products businesses expired unexercised. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2014, our management approved further actions to consolidate our business' organizational structure. We expected the total cost of these initiatives to be approximately $7 million to $9 million, of which we incurred approximately $5 million as of December 31, 2015 to substantially complete these actions. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $4 million in 2014, which included $3 million for severance and related costs and $1 million for accelerated asset retirement obligations related to the Adrian, MI facility. We recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $1 million in 2015, which included primarily professional fees and demolition costs related to the Adrian, MI closure.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $159 million in 2015 compared with net cash used in operating activities of $78 million in 2014 and net cash provided by operating activities of $79 million in 2013. Changes in key accounts are summarized below:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(89\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and post-retirement health care liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, accounts receivable generated cash flows of $24 million since December 31, 2014, primarily driven by decreases in the accounts receivable balances of our Industrial Performance and Industrial Engineered segments. The Industrial Performance segment's decline in accounts receivable was the result of lower net sales and lower sales prices as we passed along a reduction in raw material costs to certain customers in accordance with formula based contract pricing agreements. Our Industrial Engineered segment's accounts receivable was lower due primarily to lower net sales, primarily related to volume declines coupled with an improvement in collections as compared to 2014. Accounts receivable in our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment also declined from last year due to improved collections from Platform.\nInventory used cash flows of $5 million since December 31, 2014 primarily driven by an increase in our Industrial Engineered segment's inventory balance due principally to a build of inventory coupled with unfavorable absorption variances that were capitalized into inventory during the fourth quarter of 2015 offset by an increase in our inventory reserves related to a discontinued product. This increase was offset by a decrease in inventory in our Industrial Performance segment primarily the result of lower raw material costs. Inventory in our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment remained consistent with levels at December 31, 2014.\nAccounts payable used cash flows of $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily the result of a decrease in accounts payable in our Industrial Performance segment most notably related to the lower cost of raw materials and the timing of our purchases coupled with lower capital spending for our Nantong, China facility since December 31, 2014. This decrease was offset by an increase in accounts payable in our Industrial Engineered segment principally related to negotiated longer payment terms with our vendors. Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment accounts payable decreased since December 31, 2015 due to the timing of production for Platform under the supply agreements.\nWe used $28 million of cash flow for pension and post-retirement health care liabilities in large part due to cash contributions to fund pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities of $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 which included $24 million for domestic plans and $7 million for international plans.\nCash flows from operating activities in 2015 were adjusted by the impact of certain non-cash and other charges, which primarily included depreciation and amortization expense of $93 million, stock-based compensation expense of $12 million and a loss on the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business of $4 million offset by the recognition of the obligation, net of accretion, for the below-market obligations with Platform of $38 million and a gain of $8 million recorded for the release of cumulative translation adjustment associated with the liquidation of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe impact of changes in working capital of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business through the date of sale in November 2014 are included in the table above. During the year ended December 31, 2014, accounts receivable represented a use of cash of $89 million since December 31, 2013, primarily driven by increases in the accounts receivable balances of our Agrochemical Manufacturing and Industrial Engineered segments. The Agrochemical Manufacturing segment's increase was primarily due to the increase in demand particularly in North America and Europe for the 2014 growing season, extended terms for certain products in North America, a reduction in the utilization of financing facilities with banks in Brazil coupled with an increase in amounts due from Platform related to production under the supply agreements. The increase in our Industrial Engineered segment accounts receivable was due primarily to stronger sales and longer payment terms in Asia during the last months of 2014 coupled with slower payments from customer in Europe.\nInventory represented a use of cash of $31 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by increases in inventory balances in our Agrochemical Manufacturing and Industrial Performance segments, offset by inventory decreases in our Industrial Engineered segment. Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment continued to build inventory both prior and\nsubsequent to the sale of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business in anticipation of the 2015 growing season. Increased inventory balances in our Industrial Performance segment from December 31, 2013 is primarily the result of higher raw material prices, lower sales volume in intermediate, inhibitor and detergent petroleum additive products and a build of inventory at our new Ankerweg, The Netherlands plant as production increased throughout 2014. These increases were offset by a reduction in inventory in our Industrial Engineered segment primarily related to additional sales volumes in Emerald InnovationTM 3000 products and clear brine fluids and lower unfavorable manufacturing variances capitalized in 2014 compared with 2013, offset by lower sales volumes for bromine based and PCC products.\nAccounts payable represented a source of cash of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily in our Industrial Performance segment due to higher inventory purchases.\nPension and post-retirement health care liabilities represented a use of cash of $27 million primarily due to the funding of benefit obligations offset by a charge of $21 million related to the settlement of a pension obligation. Cash contributions to fund pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities amounted to $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 which included $27 million for domestic plans and $22 million for international plans.\nCash flows from operating activities in 2014 were adjusted by the impact of certain non-cash and other charges, which primarily included a gain on the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business of $529 million (the cash flows associated with the gain being reported in investing activities), a deferred tax benefit of $274 million primarily related to a release of the U.S valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets, depreciation and amortization expense of $102 million, stock-based compensation expense of $14 million, loss on sale of discontinued operations of $9 million, loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7 million and the recognition of the obligation, net of accretion, for the below-market obligations with Platform of $6 million for two month period subsequent to the sale.\nDuring 2013, accounts receivable represented a use of cash of $20 million since the end of 2012 primarily driven by Industrial Performance segment. Our Industrial Performance segment showed some increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by the sales increases this segment experienced at the end of 2013. Inventory represented a use of cash of $13 million since December 31, 2012 primarily driven by our Industrial Performance segment which reported an increase in inventory to support increased demand while our Industrial Engineered segment increased due to the acquisition of the remaining 50% of our DayStar joint venture. Accounts payable provide cash to operations of $20 million during 2013 primarily relating to our Industrial Performance segment as a result of the inventory increase resulting from higher demand. Pension and post-retirement health care liabilities represented a use of cash of $59 million primarily due to the funding of benefit obligations. Pension and post-retirement contributions amounted to $57 million during 2013 which included $32 million for domestic plans and $25 million for international plans.\nCash flows from operating activities in 2013 were adjusted by the impact of certain non-cash and other charges, which primarily included loss on sale of discontinued operations of $180 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $123 million, loss on early extinguishment of debt of $50 million, stock-based compensation expense of $14 million and impairment charges for long-lived assets of $7 million offset by a gain of $13 million recorded for the release of cumulative translation adjustment associated with the liquidation of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nCash Flows from Investing and Financing Activities\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $23 million for 2015. Investing activities included capital expenditures of $80 million for U.S. and international facilities, environmental and other compliance requirements offset by proceeds from the sale of the Platform shares of $54 million. Also included in investing activities were remaining proceeds net of transaction costs of $3 million from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $871 million for 2014. Investing activities included proceeds net of transaction costs and cash transferred of $965 million, $3 million and $3 million from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, respectively, and $13 million from the collection of a receivable from the sale of our 50% interest in Tetrabrom Technologies Ltd. in 2011. Investing activities also included capital expenditures of $113 million for U.S. and international facilities, environmental and other compliance requirements.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $184 million for 2013. Investing included capital expenditures of $170 million for U.S. and international facilities, environmental and other compliance requirements along with $3 million for the acquisition of the remaining interest in our DayStar joint venture. Investing activities also included proceeds, net of transaction costs and\ncash transferred of $78 million and $249 million from the sale of our Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, respectively, $20 million return of capital from our ISEM joint venture and $10 million from the collection of a receivable from the sale in 2011 of our 50% interest in Tetrabrom Technologies Ltd.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $189 million for 2015. Financing activities primarily included the repurchase of $150 million of our common stock under our share repurchase programs, the repayment of $42 million in principal of the Term Loan, the repayment of $15 million of our facility with the Agricultural Bank of China, Nantong Branch and payments on other long-term borrowings of $3 million, which were funded through our business divestitures and cash on hand. Other financing sources in the period were proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $20 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $935 million for 2014. Financing activities primarily included the repurchase of $618 million of our common stock under our share repurchase programs, the repayment of $236 million in principal of the Term Loan, the purchase of the remaining 7.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (the \"2018 Senior Notes\") of $105 million (including the call premium of $4 million) and payments on other long-term borrowings of $9 million, which were funded through our business divestitures and cash on hand. Other financing sources in the period were borrowings for capital improvements related to our facility in Nantong, China of $16 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $10 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $80 million for 2013. Financing activities primarily included the repurchase of $354 million of the 2018 Senior Notes, payment of the related tender premium and consent fees of $42 million and repayment of $102 million in principal of the Term Loan using the proceeds from the issuance of the $450 million of 2021 Senior Notes and cash on hand. Cash on hand was also used to repurchase $54 million of our common stock under our share repurchase program and $12 million of debt issuance costs related to the 2021 Senior Notes financing and amendments to the Term Loan and ABL Facility. Other financing sources in the period were borrowings for capital improvements related to our new facility in Nantong, China of $17 million, a promissory note for information technology software licenses of $7 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $8 million.\nContractual Obligations and Other Cash Requirements\nWe have obligations to make future cash payments under contracts and commitments, including long-term debt agreements, lease obligations, environmental liabilities, post-retirement health care liabilities and other long-term liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other cash commitments as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations and Other Cash Commitments*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 and Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(b)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(c)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(d)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Post-retirement health care liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(e)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Additional information is provided in various footnotes (including Debt, Leases, Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans, Income Taxes, and Divestitures) in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Our debt agreements include various notes and bank loans for which payments will be payable through 2021.

Estimated future funding requirements are highly dependent on factors that are not readily determinable. These include changes in legislation, returns earned on pension investments, labor negotiations and other factors related to assumptions regarding future liabilities. In 2015, we made contributions of $23 million to our domestic and international pension plans, which included a $14 million discretionary contribution to our qualified domestic plan. We also contributed $7 million to our post-retirement benefit plans (including payments made by us directly to plan participants). See Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d below for details regarding current pension assumptions.

While our utilization of these NOLs is subject to annual federal NOL limitations under Internal Revenue Code ( IRC\u201d) Section 382, we expect they will substantially reduce the amount of U.S. cash tax payments we are required to make in the foreseeable future.\nOther Sources and Uses of Cash\nWe expect to finance our continuing operations, capital spending requirements and the remainder of our authorized stock repurchase program in 2015 with cash flows provided by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and the 2018 ABL Facility. Our long-term stated total leverage target remains approximately 2 times Adjusted EBITDA. We were close to this target on December 31, 2015.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 were $323 million, of which $171 million was held by Chemtura and our U.S. subsidiaries and $152 million was held by our direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures. The cash and cash equivalents of our foreign subsidiaries are used to fund working capital requirements, make cash contributions to various pension plans and fund capital expenditures. In light of these cash requirements, we consider undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested in their operations.\nIn addition to the letters of credit of $14 million and $15 million outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, we have guarantees that have been provided to various financial institutions. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $6 million and $10 million, respectively, in guarantees. The letters of credit and guarantees were primarily related to liabilities for insurance obligations, environmental obligations, banking and credit facilities, vendor deposits and European value added tax ( VAT\u201d) obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, such undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries totaled $481 million. Proceeds received by non-U.S. subsidiaries related to the divestiture of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business were substantially repatriated during 2014. Repatriation of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to adverse tax consequences given the potentially higher U.S. effective tax rates and withholding tax requirements in the source country. Estimating the range of tax liabilities that could arise from the repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries is not practicable at this time.\nSubsequent Event\nOn February 22, 2016, we announced that, in accordance with the selection made by Evercore Trust Company, N.A. (\"Evercore Trust\"), the independent fiduciary for the Chemtura Corporation Retirement Plan (the Plan\u201d), we entered into a purchase agreement with Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (\"Voya\"), a member of the Voya Financial, Inc. family of companies, for a group annuity contract that will transfer payment responsibility to Voya for retirement pension benefit benefits owed to approximately 5,000 of our retirees in the U.S. or their designated beneficiaries.\nBy irrevocably transferring the obligations to Voya, we will partially mitigate our exposure to our defined benefit pension plans and estimate a reduction in our overall projected pension benefit obligation in the range of $350 million to $375 million, based on the valuation date of February 17, 2016. The annuity purchase price will be funded by the assets of the Plan.\nWe expect to make a cash contribution to the Plan in the first quarter of 2016 of between $30 million and $40 million in order to maintain the Plan's funded status. We expect to incur a non-cash pension settlement charge in the range of $150 million to $170 million before tax during the first quarter of 2016 in connection with this group annuity purchase.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Accounting estimates and assumptions described in this section are those we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For all of these estimates, we note that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Actual results could differ from such estimates. The following discussion summarizes our critical accounting estimates. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements are discussed in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCarrying Value of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nWe have elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment procedures for all of our reporting units in accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Goodwill ( ASC 350-20\u201d) as of July 31, or sooner, if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units utilizing income and market approaches through the application of discounted cash flow and market comparable methods (Level 3 inputs as described in Note 14 - Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements). The assessment is required to be performed in two steps: step one to test for a potential impairment of goodwill and, if potential impairments are identified, step two to measure the impairment loss through a full fair value allocation of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit utilizing the acquisition method of accounting.\nWe continually monitor and evaluate business and competitive conditions that affect our operations and reflect the impact of these factors in our financial projections. If permanent or sustained changes in business or competitive conditions occur, they can lead to revised projections that could potentially give rise to impairment charges.\nFor further discussion of impairment charges, see Note - 3 Restructuring and Asset Impairment Activities in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are involved in environmental matters of various types in a number of jurisdictions. A number of such matters involve claims for material amounts of damages and relate to or allege environmental liabilities, including cleanup costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites and natural resource damages.\nEach quarter, we evaluate and review estimates for future remediation, operation and management costs directly related to remediation, to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts. For each site where the cost of remediation is probable and reasonably estimable, we determine the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site, the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan, the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by us and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur. At sites where we expect to incur ongoing operation and maintenance expenditures, we accrue on an undiscounted basis for a period of generally 10 years those costs which are probable and reasonably estimable.\nIn addition, it is possible that our estimates for environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified, further remediation measures be required or undertaken, current laws and regulations be modified or additional environmental laws and regulations be enacted.\nWe intend to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters. The resolution of environmental matters asserted against us could require us to pay remedial costs or damages, which are not currently determinable, that could exceed our present estimates, and as a result could have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Expense\nOur calculation of pension and other post-retirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of factors and assumptions. These factors and assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other relevant factors. Components of pension and other post-retirement benefits expense include interest and service costs on the pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other post-retirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 13 - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPension Plans\nPension liabilities are measured on a discounted basis and the assumed discount rate is a significant assumption. At each measurement date, the discount rate is based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our liabilities. At December 31, 2015, we utilized a discount rate of 4.10% for our domestic qualified pension plan compared to 3.80% at December 31, 2014. For the international and non-qualified plans, a weighted average discount rate of 3.46% was used at December 31, 2015, compared to 3.28% used at December 31, 2014. As a sensitivity measure, a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate for all plans would result in less than a million dollar decrease in pre-tax earnings for 2015.\nDomestic discount rates adopted at December 31, 2015 utilized an interest rate yield curve to determine the discount rate pursuant to guidance codified under ASC Topic 715, Defined Benefit Plans ( ASC 715\u201d). The yield curve is comprised of AA bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years. We discounted the annual cash flows of our domestic pension plans using this yield curve and developed a single-point discount rate matching the respective plan's payout structure.\nA similar approach was used to determine the appropriate discount rates for the international plans. The actual method used varies from country to country depending on the amount of available information on bond yields to be able to estimate a single-point discount rate to match the respective plan's benefit disbursements.\nOur weighted average estimated rate of compensation increase was 2.88% for applicable domestic and international pension plans combined at December 31, 2015. As a sensitivity measure, an increase of 25 basis points in the estimated rate of compensation increase would decrease pre-tax earnings for 2015 by an immaterial amount.\nThe expected return on pension plan assets is based on our investment strategy, historical experience and expectations for long-term rates of return. We determine the expected rate of return on plan assets for the domestic and international pension plans by applying the expected returns on various asset classes to our target asset allocation.\nWe utilized a weighted average expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% on all domestic plan assets and a weighted average rate of 5.66% for the international plan assets for 2015.\nAsset-class return expectations are set using a combination of historical and forward-looking analyses. Historical returns are evaluated based on an arithmetic average of annual returns derived from recognized passive indices, such as the S&P 500, for the major asset classes. We looked at the arithmetic averages of annual investment returns from passive indices, assuming a portfolio of investments that follow the current target asset allocation for the domestic plans over several business cycles, to obtain an indication of the long-term historical market performance. The historical return estimates that result for each asset class are reviewed and combined with a qualitative assessment of long-term relationships between asset classes before a return estimate is finalized. The qualitative analysis is targeted towards removing the effect of unsustainable short-term valuations or trends, or capturing structural changes that are not yet reflected in the historical data. The resulting capital market assumptions\nare meant to reflect return levels and behavior that are likely to prevail over longer time periods. The geometric return over the past 19 years, the maximum available period of time for the applicable indices, was 11.94%, and over the past 10 years it was 9.47%. Both of these values exceeded the 7.50% domestic expected return on assets for 2015.\nThe actual annualized return on plan assets for the domestic plans for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was approximately (1.2%) (net of investment expenses), which was below the expected return on asset assumption for the year. The international plans realized a weighted average return of approximately 0.7% in local currency terms and approximately (5.4%) in U.S. dollar terms. Changes in exchange rates resulted in currency losses of approximately $27 million on plan assets, which were more than offset by currency gains of approximately $36 million on benefit obligations for the international pension arrangements.\nOur target asset allocation for the domestic pension plans is based on investing 32% of plan assets in equity instruments, 58% of plan assets in fixed income investments and 10% in all other types of investments. At December 31, 2015, 28% of the portfolio was invested in equities, 61% in fixed income investments and 11% in real estate and other investments.\nWe have unrecognized actuarial losses relating to our pension plans which have been included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, but not in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The extent to which these unrecognized actuarial losses will impact future pre-tax earnings depends on whether the unrecognized actuarial losses are deferred through the asset-smoothing mechanism (the market related value as defined by ASC Topic 715-30, Defined Benefit Plans - Pensions ( ASC 715-30\u201d)), or through amortization in pre-tax earnings to the extent that they exceed a 10% amortization corridor, as defined by ASC 715-30, which provides for amortization over the average remaining participant career or life. The amortization of unrecognized net losses existing as of December 31, 2015 will result in a $16 million decrease to pre-tax earnings for 2016 ($11 million for the qualified domestic plans and $5 million for the international and non-qualified plans). Since future gains and losses beyond 2015 are a result of various factors described herein, it is not possible to predict with certainty to what extent the combination of current and future losses may exceed the 10 percent amortization corridor and thereby be subject to further amortization. At the end of 2015, unrecognized net losses amounted to $270 million for the qualified domestic plans and $137 million for the international and non-qualified plans. Of these amounts, $23 million of unrecognized losses for the domestic plans and $17 million of unrecognized gains for the international plans are deferred through the asset smoothing mechanism as required by ASC 715.\nThe pre-tax pension expense for all pension plans was $1 million in 2015. Pension (income) expense is calculated based upon certain assumptions including discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and expected salary and wage increases. Actual results that differ from the current assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and will affect pension expense in future periods.\nThe following table estimates the future pension expense (income), based upon current assumptions:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Expense (Income) By Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Qualified domestic pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International and non-qualified pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe impact of a 100 basis point change in the actual return on assets would not have a material impact on the pension (income) expense for the above years.\nWe participate in a multi-employer pension plan that provides defined benefits to certain employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The risks of participating in a multi-employer plan differ from those of a single employer plan. The net pension cost of a multi-employer plan is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. Contributions that we make to the plan are not segregated and may be used to fund benefits to employees of other participating employers. The future cost of the plan is dependent on a number of factors, including the funded status of the plan and the ability of other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations. If one employer stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligation of the plan may have to be assumed by the remaining participating employers.\nOur contributions to the multi-employer plan for 2015 and prior years have been insignificant. However, due to the withdrawal of certain employers from the plan, there is uncertainty regarding the impact on our future contributions, although any\nincremental future contributions are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. We will continue to assess our obligations and risks associated to the multi-employer plan, and update our disclosures accordingly.\nOther Post-Retirement Benefits\nWe provide post-retirement health and life insurance benefits for current retired and active employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents for certain domestic and international employee groups.\nThe discount rates we adopted for the valuation of the post-retirement health care plans were determined using the same methodology as for the pension plans. At December 31, 2015, we utilized a weighted average discount rate of 3.97% for post-retirement health care plans, compared to 3.70% at December 31, 2014. As a sensitivity measure, a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would result in an immaterial change in pre-tax earnings for 2015.\nAssumed health care cost trend rates are based on past and current health care cost trends, considering such factors as health care inflation, changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns, technological advances, and the overall health of plan participants. We use health care trend cost rates starting with a weighted average initial level of 4.55% for the domestic arrangements and grading up to an ultimate level of 5%. For the international arrangements, the weighted average initial rate is 6.50%, grading down to 5%.\nThe pre-tax post-retirement healthcare expense was $2 million in 2015 and is expected to approximate $1 million per year for years 2016 to 2020 based upon the various assumptions discussed above.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes payable reflect our current tax provision and management's best estimate of the current tax liability relating to the outcome of uncertain tax positions. If the actual outcome of uncertain tax positions differs from our best estimates, an adjustment to income taxes payable could be required, which may result in additional income tax expense or benefit.\nWe record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. We also record deferred tax assets for the expected future tax benefits of net operating losses and income tax credit carryforwards.\nValuation allowances are established when we determine that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Thus, changes in future results of operations could result in adjustments to our valuation allowances.\nWe anticipate that we will repatriate the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we decreased by $10 million the amount of the net deferred tax liability we provide for the U.S. tax consequences of these repatriations, primarily due to the repatriations as a result of the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we decreased by $25 million, the amount of the net deferred tax liability we provide for the U.S. tax consequences of these repatriations. We consider undistributed earnings of all other foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested in their operations. At December 31, 2015, such undistributed earnings deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations amounted to $481 million. Repatriation of undistributed earnings, currently deemed indefinitely reinvested, would require us to accrue and pay taxes in the future. Estimating the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated is not practicable at this time.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S (including federal and state) and foreign jurisdictions. The income tax returns for our entities taxable in the U.S. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment. We assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The economic benefit associated with a tax position will only be recognized if it is more likely than not that a tax position ultimately will be sustained. We adjust these liabilities, if necessary, upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law.\nWe have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $27 million and $28 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This decrease is primarily related to actual cash repatriations made during the current year that offset the liability established in prior years for deemed repatriations and settlements of tax audits in various domestic and foreign jurisdictions.\nACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nFor information on accounting developments, see Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOUTLOOK\nIn 2016, we plan to build upon the improvements in our earnings and cash flow we achieved in 2015 to further expand Chemtura's profitability. We expect to deliver that improvement by continuing to focus on managing what we can control.\u201d\nIn 2015, we laid the foundation for improved performance through our manufacturing and SG&A cost reduction programs and through our commercial and operational excellence programs. In 2016, we anticipate being able to sustain the cost reductions we delivered in 2015 and offset cost inflation by the application of continuous improvement and productivity initiatives. However, to achieve further profitability improvement, we plan to deliver growth in sales volume by executing upon our growth levers.\nThe foundation for sales volume growth in 2016 has been laid in recent years by our investments in new product introductions, product enhancements and manufacturing capacity expansion. These investments have been focused on leveraging secular growth opportunities. We do not anticipate any general economic improvements to assist us in gaining sales volume and we face the uncertainties that flow from the continuing reduction in the price of oil and the slowing of the Chinese economy.\nThe resulting gains in sales volume should continue to improve the utilization of most but not all of the manufacturing capacity we have added in recent years and thereby reduce our unit product costs. By the end of 2015, we had completed the commissioning of the third and final phase of our investment in our Nantong, China multi-purpose plant with the completion of the urethanes unit. While this unit will commence the production and sale of urethane products in 2016, the slowing of the Chinese economic growth leads us to conclude that the rate at which we may be able to build sales from all three Nantong manufacturing units will be slower than we had previously anticipated.\nIndustrial Performance Products has now been successful in establishing additional supply of the key raw material that had constrained the volume of high viscosity polyalphaolefin synthetic base-stocks they could produce in 2015. With increased raw material availability, we anticipate being able to serve customers' demand for these products, improving the utilization of both the Elmira, Canada and Amsterdam, The Netherlands manufacturing facilities. The investments this segment has made to increase our capacity to produce our inhibitor lubricant additives will permit them to serve the increasing demand for these products in 2016. This segment has also secured additional customer requirements for its urethane hot cast elastomer products. The anticipated increased sales of these products should lay the foundation for their 2016 volume growth.\nWithin Industrial Engineered Products, in 2016 we should see customers complete their adoption of our Emerald InnovationTM 3000 flame retardant used in styrene-based insulation foams, replacing HBCD of which we discontinued manufacturing in 2015. The improvements in operating efficiency made in late 2015 should enable us to increase Emerald Innovation\u2122 3000 production rates to serve increased customer demand. In addition, in light of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's decision on mercury and air toxics standards, we anticipate that demand for our GeoBrom\u00ae product used in mercury control applications should increase during 2016. This segment has also secured additional demand for its traditional and metalocene-based polymerization catalysts and its tin-based products that should continue the recovery in performance of the organometallics product line that commenced in 2015. These volume gains and other growth opportunities should more than offset any weakening of demand for our clear brine fluid products used in deep offshore oil and gas applications that may occur. As a result of the lower oil prices, producers are reducing their investment in exploration and it is likely that we may see some reduction in demand compared to 2015. However, we do not yet have visibility as to when in 2016 such declines may occur. In addition, we anticipate that the segment should reflect the full year benefit of the changes in sales prices of bromine and certain derivatives that occurred in 2015.\nIn February 2016, we made a decision to discontinue one of our product lines within the Industrial Engineered Products segment. Inventory associated with this product line has been written down to its net realizable value of zero in the fourth quarter of 2015. The value of the property, plant and equipment associated with this product line at December 31, 2015 was approximately $7 million. We are currently in the process of determining whether this property, plant and equipment has an alternative use and the amount, if any, of asset impairment we will take in the first quarter of 2016.\nDespite the low oil price, due to supply and demand conditions for certain of the raw materials we purchase, in 2016 we anticipate that raw material costs in the aggregate will modestly increase compared to the prior year.\nThe cash generated from our anticipated improved profitability in 2016 can be used to fund an increase in capital expenditures to approximately $100 million for the year as well as the growth in working capital required by higher net sales. As a result, we expect generation for the year to be comparable to 2015 before cash used to repurchase our shares under our Board authorized share repurchase program, the repayment of the remainder of our senior secured term loan on or before maturity, and the funding of cash contributions to our pension and other post-retirement benefits plans.\nWe continue to explore opportunities to accelerate value creation for our shareholders through gaining scale by acquisition or a combination with another company. We believe that through building scale in industrial specialty chemicals, we can diversify our market exposures and give our Company the critical mass to invest in innovative products and applications. Executing on a compelling transaction can accelerate the benefits from our focus on the organic growth of our existing portfolio businesses and permit us to sustain our track record of delivering significant value to our shareholders.\nThere are a number of risks to achieving our business plans as described in Item 1A - Risk Factors and summarized below in Forward Looking Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nIn addition to historical information, this Report contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.

These statements are based on our estimates and assumptions and on currently available information. The forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed. Forward-looking information is intended to reflect opinions as of the date this Form 10-K was filed. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements to conform the statements to actual results or changes in our operations.\nOUR BUSINESS\nWe are a global, United States publicly traded specialty chemical company dedicated to delivering innovative, performance-driven engineered specialty chemical solutions which are used as additives, ingredients or intermediates that add value to our customers' end products. We are committed to global sustainability through greener technology\u201d and developing engineered chemical solutions that meet our customers' evolving needs. We operate in a wide variety of end-use industries, including automotive, building and construction, electronics, lubricants, packaging and transportation. We are a leader in many of our key product lines and transact business in approximately 90 countries. Our principal executive offices are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Middlebury, Connecticut.\nDuring 2013 and 2014, through a series of divestitures, we transformed ourselves from a diversified specialty chemical company into a company primarily serving the global industrial specialty chemical market.\nPrior to 2015 as part of our transformational initiatives, we divested several businesses that did not fit with our strategic objectives. In November 2014, we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform Specialty Products Corporation (\"Platform\"). The sale included the stock of certain subsidiaries, the dedicated manufacturing plants located at Gajraula, India and Pekin, Illinois, working capital and certain other assets as well as the assumption of certain liabilities. In December 2013, we completed the sale of our subsidiaries dedicated to the Consumer Products business to KIK Custom Products Inc. (\"KIK\"). The assets of those subsidiaries included dedicated manufacturing plants in the U.S. and South Africa. In April 2013, we completed an asset sale of our antioxidant and UV Stabilizer (the \"Antioxidant\") business to SK Blue Holdings, Ltd. (\"SK\") and Addivant USA Holdings Corp. (\"Addivant\"). The sale included dedicated manufacturing plants in the U.S., France, and Germany, and joint venture interests in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Korea. A further description of these transactions are provided in Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnder the terms of the sale agreement with Platform, we retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and have continued to manufacture products for Platform under several supply agreements and a tolling agreement (collectively, the supply agreements\u201d). The supply agreements have minimum terms of between two and four years. To reflect the change in the nature of operations, we changed the name of our Chemtura AgroSolutions segment to Agrochemical Manufacturing after the sale in 2014.\nOur commitment to this strategic change required us to reevaluate our remaining operations and management structure as well as our ability to increase operating efficiencies, reduce costs and increase value to our shareholders. In addition to the divestiture of our non-strategic businesses, in the fourth quarter of 2014, our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") approved a restructuring plan (the \"2014 Restructuring Plan\") to eliminate the stranded costs associated with our Chemtura AgroSolutions business, streamline the costs of our manufacturing operations and align our remaining operations and management structure for operating efficiencies designed to increase our business operating income and cash flows and build a platform for future organic growth. A further description of this restructuring initiative is provided in Note 3 - Restructuring and Asset Impairment Activities.\nWe entered 2015 a transformed company. We are comprised of two strategic business reporting segments, Industrial Performance Products and Industrial Engineered Products which, coupled with our Corporate reporting segment, are collectively referred to as our \"Core Segments\". In addition to our Core Segments, our Agrochemical Manufacturing reporting segment represents the ongoing activity with Platform under the supply agreements.\nThe primary economic factors that influence the operations and net sales of our Industrial Performance Products ( Industrial Performance\u201d) and Industrial Engineered Products ( Industrial Engineered\u201d) segments (collectively referred to as Industrials\u201d) are demand conditions in industrial, electronics, energy, residential and commercial construction, and transportation markets. Other factors affecting our financial performance include industry capacity, customer demand, raw material and energy costs, and sales prices. Sales prices are influenced by the global demand and supply for the products we produce, our ability to innovate and differentiate our products and competitor behavior. We seek to pursue sales prices that reflect the value our products deliver to our customers, while aiming to pass on higher raw material and energy costs to our customers to preserve our profit margins. The risks that may impact our performance are included in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE\nIn 2015, we substantially delivered on our commitments we had established for our transformed company despite being a smaller company and encountering some headwinds in the supply of certain raw materials and sluggish market demand conditions. Among the many accomplishments in 2015 were:\nImprovement Initiatives\n \u2022 We announced in late 2014 a cost reduction program to deliver $62 million annualized incurred cost savings indicating we would realize $50 million of savings in 2015. We delivered on that commitment and achieved our \"run-rate\" savings in incurred costs in the third quarter of 2015 although part of the benefit was offset by the absorption effect of lower sales volume. \n \u2022 We promptly eliminated the stranded costs associated with our former Chemtura AgroSolutions business. We also completed the closure of our West Lafayette, Indiana and Adrian, Michigan facilities. These actions together with the manufacturing and SG&A cost reduction program substantially completed the 2014 Restructuring Plan. \n \u2022 We increased the percentage of operating income to net sales in our Industrial Performance and Industrial Engineered segments by 520 basis points and 600 basis points, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared with prior year end despite a reduction in net sales for the same periods. The improvement came from the benefits of our cost reduction actions and from \"price-over-raw material costs\", among other factors. \n \u2022 We demonstrated substantial improvements in cash flow. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $159 million, an improvement of $237 million from 2014 when we used cash. Capital expenditures declined as planned from $113 million in 2014 to $80 million in 2015. \n \u2022 We continued to drive our commercial and operational excellence initiatives, improving our customers' experience and our operating effectiveness. \n \u2022 We continued to reduce the number of our legal entities, primarily through liquidation, eliminating the costs of regulatory and other compliance. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an $8 million gain due to the release of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments on these liquidations.  Share Repurchases\n \u2022 During 2015, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a cost of $150 million. As of December 31, 2015, $171 million remained outstanding under our Board authorized share repurchase program to fund further repurchases in 2016.  Debt Repayments\n \u2022 During 2015, we reduced our outstanding debt by $57 million primarily the result of payments made with proceeds from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business and cash on hand, lowering our total debt to $517 million as of December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 We reduced interest expense by $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared with the prior year end due to debt repayments made in 2015 and late 2014. \n \u2022 With the combination of improved operating profitability and cash flows and the reductions in debt outstanding, we ended 2015 with our total debt close to our long term financial goal of 2 times Adjusted EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA is defined in this section under the heading ADJUSTED EBITDA).  Other\n \u2022 During the second quarter of 2015, we sold 2 million shares of Platform common stock that we had received as part of the purchase price consideration when we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform in 2014 for net cash proceeds of $54 million. As a result of holding the shares, which were accounted for as available for sale securities, we reported a net gain of $3 million in the second quarter of 2015.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur management discussion and analysis of our results of operations relates to our business from continuing operations.\nThe sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business in November 2014 did not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation and, therefore, our results from continuing operations includes the historical financial information of that business through the date of sale. Given the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform in 2014, a discussion of the results of operations for the consolidated company for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is less meaningful to investors due to the sale and the change in the nature of the operations associated with our Agrochemical Manufacturing business from a market participant to a supplier of products to Platform under the supply agreements.\nWe determined that the most effective way to present to investors the change in results of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, as well as the comparison for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended December 31, 2013, is to provide separate discussions of the changes in our consolidated results for the Core Segments and then separately for the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment.\nUnder the headings \"2015 Compared to 2014\" and \"2014 Compared to 2013,\" we are providing a table which presents the results of operations of the consolidated Company including the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment through operating income. The table then segregates the results of operations for our Core Segments and our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment. The discussion of the components of operating income included in the section titled Overview only reflect changes related to the Core Segments. A separate discussion regarding the changes in results of operations of the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment is presented in each section under the heading Agrochemical Manufacturing\u201d.\nComponents of net income which are not included in operating income are affected by other factors in addition to the inconsistency in the results of operations after the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. We therefore have not included net income in the tables. As a result, the comparison discussions for the changes in those components which are not part of operating income are presented for the Company as a whole.\nFor a further discussion on the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business and the ongoing supply agreements with Platform, as well as the sale of our Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, see Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2015 COMPARED TO 2014\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agrochemical\n</td> <td>Core\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agrochemical\n</td> <td>Core\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>Segments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>Segments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility closures, severance and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) - Excludes depreciation and amortization expense which are shown separately.\nOverview\nConsolidated net sales of our Core Segments were $1.6 billion in 2015 or $179 million lower than in 2014 due to lower sales volume of $129 million, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38 million and lower sales prices of $12 million.\nThe larger portion of the decline in sales volume was attributable to our Industrial Engineered segment. Our Industrial Performance segment also reflected some sales volume declines as well as the effects of unfavorable product mix as compared with 2014. Our Industrial Engineered segment reported a decline in overall volume, despite volume improvement in the sales of our Emerald Innovation 3000\u2122 product used in the manufacture of insulation foam for building and construction applications and in clear brine fluids used in oilfield applications. However, due to the impact of a strike at a supplier of elemental bromine in the first half of 2015 and the disruptions in the import and export of hazardous materials in China as a result of the fire at the Tianjin, China port, we experienced a decline in sales volumes for our elemental bromine-based products and products used in energy and electronic applications. Additionally, decreased demand for flame retardant products used in furniture foam applications and the discontinuance of certain products late in 2014 and in 2015 led to further sales volume declines. Our Industrial Performance segment also experienced a decline in overall sales volume; however, unfavorable product mix particularly in the automotive, power generation, mining, oil and gas application products was a primary driver of lower net sales. Increased overall sales prices in our Industrial Engineered segment products were offset by sales price declines\nin our Industrial Performance segment due to our obligation to pass along the reductions in raw material costs resulting from lower oil prices to certain customers under formula based pricing contracts. Throughout 2015, we experienced the unfavorable effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar compared to other major currencies which reduced the U.S. Dollar value of our net sales denominated in foreign currencies.\nGross profit for our Core Segments in 2015 was $393 million, an increase of $49 million compared to $344 million in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 24% in 2015 compared with 19% in 2014. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to lower raw material costs resulting from lower oil prices, lower manufacturing costs as a result of our cost reduction initiatives, lower distribution costs and favorable foreign currency translation, partly offset by lower sales volume, unfavorable product mix and lower sales prices and a charge of $8 million related to an increase in our inventory reserves for a discontinued product.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense of $150 million was $45 million lower than 2014. Our SG&A for 2014 included a $21 million one-time charge related to the settlement of pension obligations and $18 million of expenses we incurred in connection with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. The remaining reduction in SG&A expense from 2014 is the result of our various cost savings initiatives that we announced at the end of 2014, including the elimination of stranded costs associated with our Chemtura AgroSolutions business, offset in part by higher cost accruals under our employee benefit and management incentive plans in 2015 compared to last year due to our improved performance.\nFacility closures, severance and related costs in 2015 were $3 million compared with $25 million for 2014. The expense related to the cost reduction initiatives we announced in 2014 and 2013. The restructuring plans in 2014 and 2015 related to both the elimination of stranded costs associated with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Consumer Products and Antioxidant businesses as well as initiatives to reduce manufacturing and SG&A costs within our Industrials businesses. Our restructuring plans are described in more detail in Note 3 - Restructuring and Assets Impairment Activities of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe loss on sale of business of $4 million in 2015 and the gain on sale of business of $529 million in 2014 are related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform in 2014 and the settlement of working capital adjustments and finalization of other post-closing terms of the sale and purchase agreement in 2015.\nOther Non-Operating Income and Expense\nThe following discussion about income and expense components that are not included in the computation of operating income are presented on a total company basis, which is the sum of the Core Segments and the Agrochemical Manufacturing Segment.\nInterest expense of $30 million during 2015 was $15 million lower than 2014, primarily the result of our repayments of debt utilizing net after-tax cash proceeds from the sale of Chemtura AgroSolutions.\nLoss on the early extinguishment of debt of $7 million for 2014 included a call premium and the write-off of unamortized capitalized financing costs and original issuance discount.\nOther income, net was $20 million for 2015 compared with $12 million for 2014. Other income, net in 2015 included a gain of $8 million related to the release of cumulative translation adjustments associated with the rationalization of certain European subsidiaries that were no longer required and a gain of $3 million related to the sale of the Platform shares. The remaining activity primarily reflected realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses, most significantly related to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies which began in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nThe income tax expense in 2015 was $16 million compared with a benefit of $192 million in 2014. The tax benefit reported in 2014 included a release of U.S. valuation allowance in the amount of $406 million and the tax expense related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. In 2014, we concluded that the positive evidence that we can utilize our U.S. deferred tax assets before they expire outweighed the negative evidence and as a result we released a majority of our U.S. valuation allowance.\nEarnings from continuing operations for 2015 was $136 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, as compared with $771 million, or $8.43 per diluted share in 2014. The after tax gain on the sale of Chemtura AgroSolutions and the tax benefit from the release of the majority of the valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets were the largest contributors to diluted earnings per share in 2014.\nEarnings from discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, which related to the Consumer Products business.\nLoss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, which primarily represented post-closing adjustments and obligations, settlement of working capital claims and fees associated with those adjustments and claims related to the sale of our Consumer Products business.\nThe following table describes the major factors impacting net sales

over raw materials is the sum of the net changes in sales prices and the net changes in raw material costs between the two periods. As the reduction in the costs of certain raw materials result in certain circumstances in reductions in sales prices under certain contractual and negotiated agreements, the change in sales prices net of changes in raw material costs provides a better measure of the impact of sales price changes on our profitability (referred to as \"price over raw materials\").  The following is a discussion of the results of our segments for 2015 compared with 2014.\nIndustrial Performance Products\nOur Industrial Performance segment reported higher operating income on lower net sales for 2015 as compared with 2014.\nThe decline in net sales resulted from changes in product mix predominantly in our petroleum additive products coupled with overall lower sales volume in both petroleum additive and urethane product lines. Net sales further declined due to overall lower average sales prices, the result of lower raw material costs and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. As\n2015 progressed, we felt the effects of lower demand as our customer's began to manage inventory as demand in mining and oil and gas application products weakened. This weakening effected our product mix as we retained a higher volume of some of our lower margin products. Net sales were further impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies resulting in the value of net sales in foreign currency translating to lower U.S. Dollar sales in 2015 as compared with 2014. Overall lower sales prices particularly for our petroleum additive products were principally the result of our contractual and negotiated agreements that in certain circumstances result in reductions in sales prices when certain raw material costs decline.\nDespite the reduction in net sales, operating income compared with 2014 was $35 million higher due to the benefit of our ability to hold sales prices for our more specialty products, lower raw material and manufacturing costs and lower SG&A and research and development (\"R&D\", collectively, SGA&R\u201d) expense primarily the result of implementing many of the cost reduction initiatives we announced in 2014. The changes in foreign exchange rates provided a net benefit due to the location of our manufacturing footprint such that the reduction in foreign currency denominated production and administrative costs in U.S. dollar terms more than offset the unfavorable translation of foreign currency denominated net sales. These benefits more than offset the impacts of unfavorable volume and product mix described above.\nIndustrial Engineered Products\nOur Industrial Engineered segment reported lower net sales but higher operating income for 2015 compared with 2014.\nThe decline in net sales was primarily related to a decline in overall volume and product mix offset in part by increases in average sales prices. We experienced lower sales volume in our flame retardant products used in energy and electronic applications and in flexible urethane foams used in furniture applications coupled with a reduction in bromine products used in fine chemical applications offset in part by increases in demand for our Emerald Innovation 3000\u2122 product used in insulation foam applications in building and construction and clear brine fluids used in oilfield applications. The growth in net sales of clear brine fluids occurred despite the overall decline in oil and gas exploration in 2015. This is likely due to the timing of the completion of the deep water drilling projects in which our products are used and may not be indicative of future net sales for these products in these applications.\nDuring the first half of 2015, we experienced an interruption in the supply of elemental bromine due to a strike at a third-party supplier. While the strike ended early in the third quarter, it took until the end of the year for supply to fully recover. The fire and explosion at the Tianjin, China port in August caused disruptions to the import and export of hazardous materials in China which led to unfavorable volume impacts on certain of our products. Additionally, the discontinuance of sales of certain phosphorus-based flame products toward the end of 2014 and the discontinuation of sales of certain bromine based biocides when we closed our Adrian, MI manufacturing facility in June 2015 resulted in further sales volume declines year-over-year. Sales prices for our bromine and bromine derivative products started to recover as 2015 progressed, particularly for electronic flame retardant applications. This benefit was offset in part by unfavorable currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies in 2015.\nThe benefit of our cost savings initiatives and the increase in sales prices offset the reduction in net sales. In 2015, we generated $58 million in operating profit, a $42 million increase over 2014. The effect of sales volume declines on operating income were offset by the benefit of \"price over raw material\" costs, lower manufacturing and distribution costs and lower SGA&R. Operating profit in 2015 was impacted by an $8 million charge to increase our inventory reserves for a discontinued product. By the third quarter of 2015, we had realized the full benefit of our cost reduction initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2014, although part of that benefit was offset by the absorption effects of lower sales volume and the increase in our inventory reserves.\nCorporate\nIncluded in our general corporate expenses are costs of a general nature or managed on a corporate basis. These costs, net of allocations to the business segments, primarily represent corporate stewardship and administration activities together with costs associated with legacy activities and intangible asset amortization. Functional costs are allocated between the business segments and general corporate expense.\nCorporate expense was $64 million and $93 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which included amortization expense related to intangible assets and depreciation expense of $14 million and $16 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively. Our 2014 corporate expense included a one-time charge for $21 million in 2014 related to the settlement of a pension obligation and $18 million of non-recurring costs related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. The remaining increase in corporate expense in 2015 is the result of higher accruals under our employee benefit and management incentive plans in 2015 compared\nto last year due to improved performance coupled with higher accruals for environmental obligations and project costs partly offset by lower costs as a result of our cost savings initiatives.\nAgrochemical Manufacturing\nIn the first ten months of 2014, our Chemtura AgroSolutions business manufactured and resold agrochemical products to third party distributors and customers. In November 2014, we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform. Under the terms of the sale agreement with Platform, we retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and are continuing to manufacture products for Platform under the supply agreements. We operated under the supply agreements for the two months ended December 31, 2014 and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Therefore, the results of operations in 2014 are not comparable to the result of operations in 2015. In light of the incomparability, we have only provided discussion on the results of operations for 2015 and the net sales and operating profit of this segment prior to the sale in 2014.\nSupply Agreement Results\nThe supply agreements with Platform are designed to recover the actual cash costs incurred to manufacture the products under the agreements. Accordingly, the supply agreements are considered below-market contracts for their full term. Contemporaneous with the sale, we accrued in 2014 an obligation of $230 million, on a discounted basis, which represents the loss of profit on these products over the terms of the supply agreements, including contractual obligations to continue supply for a period of up to 2 years after termination of the supply agreements. The recognition of the obligation, along with the accretion of the obligation to its undiscounted value of $345 million, will be recorded as net sales on a straight-line basis over the term of each supply agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment net sales were $137 million, which included $38 million related to the recognition of our fulfillment of the obligation, net of accretion related to the below-market supply agreements. For the two month period ended December 31, 2014, the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment net sales were $22 million, which included $6 million related to the recognition of our fulfillment of the obligation, net of accretion related to the below-market supply agreements.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $35 million compared with $6 million for the two months ended December 31, 2014. As the contracts were designed to recover a majority of the costs incurred, operating income reflected the recognition of the obligation, net of accretion, related to the below market contract, less a small amount of depreciation and amortization that is not included as part of the recoverable costs.\nPrevious Results of the Chemtura AgroSolutions Business (Pre-Divestiture)\nNet sales of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business for the ten months ended October 31, 2014 were $381 million and operating income was $80 million.\n2014 COMPARED TO 2013\nOverview\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agrochemical\n</td> <td>Core\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agrochemical\n</td> <td>Core\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>Segments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>Manufacturing\n</td> <td>Segments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility closures, severance and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity (income) loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) - Excludes depreciation and amortization expense which are shown separately.\nOverview\nConsolidated net sales of our Core Segments were $1.8 billion in 2014 or $5 million higher than in 2013 driven by a $12 million increase in volume which was offset in part by a $4 million reduction in average sales prices and $3 million related to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. Our Industrial Performance segment reported an increase in sales which represented an increase in volume of our polyester polyols and sales price increases of our petroleum additive products offset by volume declines in our intermediate, detergents and inhibitor products. Our Industrial Engineered segment reported a decline in sales due to competition reducing sales prices for a number of our product lines and the decline in demand for our flexible foam application products weakened as the year progressed unfavorably impacting volume. Our Industrial Engineered segment delivered improvement in volume of our brominated performance products which was offset in part by declines in sales volumes for our polymerization co-catalysts products.\nGross profit for our Core Segments in 2014 was $344 million, an increase of $8 million compared to $336 million in 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of sales remained stable at 19% for both years. Gross profit in dollars increased due to the absence of a $21 million charge we took in 2013 related to costs to remediate a legacy non-operating site in France. Our gross profit was unfavorably impacted by the decrease in sales prices, an increase in raw material, distribution and manufacturing costs, and unfavorable product mix offset by the elimination of stranded costs associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses and other cost savings initiatives.\nSG&A expense of $195 million was $27 million higher than in 2013, primarily the result of a $21 million charge related to the settlement of pension obligations, $12 million of additional costs in 2014 associated with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business (exclusive of the amounts reported as part of the gain on sale) and $9 million in costs associated with our investment in business excellence initiatives. This was partially offset by $3 million in other pension matters primarily related to the absence of one-time charges that were recorded in 2013, a $3 million reduction in selling expense and the remainder in savings associated with the reduction of employee costs and benefits associated with our restructuring programs and the elimination of the stranded costs associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses.\nFacility closures, severance and related costs in 2014 was $25 million compared with $42 million for 2013. The expense related to the cost reduction initiatives we announced in 2014 and 2013. The restructuring plans related to both the elimination of stranded costs associated with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Consumer Products and Antioxidant businesses as well as initiatives to reduce manufacturing and SG&A costs within our Industrials businesses. Our restructuring plans are described in more detail in Note 3 - Restructuring and Assets Impairment Activities of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe gain on sale of business of $529 million in 2014 represented the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform.\nOther Non-Operating Income and Expense\nThe following discussion about income and expense outside of operating income is presented on a total company basis, which is the sum of the Core Segments and the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment.\nInterest expense of $45 million during 2014 was $15 million lower than 2013 due to our debt refinancing actions taken in the second half of 2013. The full benefit of our fourth quarter 2014 redemption of the outstanding 2018 Senior Notes and the pay down of the Term Loan due 2016 (the \"Term Loan\") are reflected in our 2015 results.\nLoss on the early extinguishment of debt of $7 million for 2014 included a call premium and the write-off of unamortized capitalized financing costs and original issuance discount. Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $50 million for 2013 included the difference between the principal amount of the 2018 Senior Notes tendered and the sum of the tender offer consideration and consent payments and the write-off of unamortized capitalized financing costs and original issuance discount.\nOther income, net was $12 million for 2014 compared with $8 million for 2013. Other income, net primarily reflected the net impact of foreign exchange gains and losses. In 2014, we realized foreign exchange gains and losses on the repayment of several foreign denominated intercompany loans between our subsidiaries in addition to significant fluctuations in the Euro and British Pound Sterling. In addition, during 2013, we recognized a gain of $13 million related to the release of cumulative translation adjustments associated with the rationalization of certain European subsidiaries that are no longer required.\nThe income tax benefit in 2014 was $192 million compared with expense of $18 million in 2013. The tax benefit reported in 2014 included a release of U.S. valuation allowance in the amount of $406 million and the tax expense related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. In 2014, we concluded that the positive evidence that we can utilize our U.S. deferred tax\nassets before they expire outweighed the negative evidence and as a result we released a majority of our U.S. valuation allowance. In 2013, tax expense was related to taxable income of certain of our international subsidiaries. In 2013, we provided a full valuation allowance against the tax expense associated with our U.S. net operating loss.\nEarnings from continuing operations for 2014 was $771 million, or $8.43 per diluted share, as compared with a loss from continuing operations of $22 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in 2013.\nEarnings from discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared with $25 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for 2013. Discontinued operations in 2013 represented the results of operations of our Antioxidants business through its sale in April 2013 and our Consumer Products business through its sale in December 2013. Additionally, in 2013, we recorded an impairment charge of $7 million which included the impairment of property, plant and equipment related to the Consumer Products business.\nLoss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $9 million, or $0.10, per diluted share. The loss represented customary working capital adjustments of $1 million and $8 million associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products divestitures, respectively. Loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax for 2013, was $180 million, or $1.84, per diluted share which represented a net loss of $155 million and $25 million associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, respectively.\nThe following table describes the major factors impacting net sales and operating income for each of our segments:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td>

As the reduction in the costs of certain raw materials result in certain circumstances in reductions in sales prices under certain contractual and negotiated agreements, the change in sales prices net of \nchanges in raw material costs provides a better measure of the impact of sales price changes on our profitability (referred to as \"price over raw materials\").\nThe following is a discussion of the results of our segments for 2014 compared with 2013.\nIndustrial Performance Products\nOur Industrial Performance segment reported higher net sales and lower operating income in 2014 compared with 2013.\nWe experienced overall volume declines in our intermediate, inhibitor and detergent petroleum additive products which was more than offset by volume improvement in our synthetic basestocks for finished fluid applications, Adiprene\u00ae/Vibrathane\u00ae products and polyester polyols. Net sales price increases were unable to offset the loss in volume. Overall sales price for our petroleum additive products was favorable to prior year but still fell short of covering increases in our raw material costs. Operating income reflected a favorable product mix of selling higher margin products than in 2013 which was offset in part by higher distribution and SGA&R.\nOperating income was $106 million in 2014, a decrease of $3 million compared with 2013. The decrease reflected higher raw material costs, an increase in SGA&R costs and additional accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment, offset by higher sales volume and favorable product mix, higher sales prices and favorable foreign currency translation.\nIndustrial Engineered Products\nOur Industrial Engineered segment reported lower net sales and operating income in 2014 compared with 2013.\nDuring 2014, we felt the effects of excess industry capacity in bromine and in polymerization co-catalysts products (\"PCC\"). The resulting competition driven by excess supply drove a reduction in our sales prices and resulted in lower volumes. We saw growth in the sales of our Emerald Innovation 3000TM products as customers switched to this alternative from traditional HBCD flame retardant styrene based insulation foam applications coupled with increased volume from international markets for our clear brine fluids used in energy markets partly offset the reductions in bromine based products and PCC volumes. Demand for flexible foam flame retardant products declined as the year progressed resulting in lower volumes. Towards the end of the year, sales prices for bromine products stabilized, but sales prices did not recover to 2013 levels. While we experienced a decrease in our raw material costs, the benefit was offset by the decline in sales prices, increase in sales of lower margin products, higher manufacturing and other costs and higher SGA&R expenses.\nOperating income of $16 million in 2014 decreased $39 million compared with last year. The decrease reflected unfavorable volume and product mix, lower sales prices, higher SGA&R costs, unfavorable foreign currency translation, higher distribution costs and an increase in other costs, offset by a decrease in raw material costs.\nCorporate\nCorporate expense was $93 million and $112 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, which included amortization expense related to intangible assets and depreciation expense of $16 million and $18 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively. Included in corporate expense in 2013 was a charge of $21 million to increase an environmental reserve for the costs to remediate a legacy non-operating site in France. Included in corporate expense in 2014 is a charge for $21 million related to the settlement of a pension obligation, an additional $12 million of costs incurred in the exploration and sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business over 2013, exclusive of the amount reported as part of the gain on sale, offset by $24 million related to the elimination of stranded costs associated with our Chemtura AgroSolutions business in 2014 and our Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses which were sold in 2013.\nAgrochemical Manufacturing\nIn 2013 and for the first ten months of 2014, our Chemtura AgroSolutions business manufactured and resold agrochemical products to third party distributors and customers. In November 2014, we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform. Under the terms of the sale agreement with Platform, we have retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and will continue to manufacture products for Platform under the supply agreements. We operated under the supply agreements for the two months ended December 31, 2014. Therefore, the results of operations for the previous Chemtura AgroSolutions business is not comparable to the Agrochemical Manufacturing business. The following represents a discussion of the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment on a go-forward basis and of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business on a pre-sale basis compared with 2013.\nSupply Agreement Results\nFor the two month period ended December 31, 2014, the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment's net sales were $22 million, which included $6 million related to the recognition of our fulfillment of the obligation, net of accretion related to the below-market supply agreements.\nOperating income for the two months ended December 31, 2014 was $6 million. As the contracts were designed to recover a majority of the costs incurred, operating income reflects only the recognition of the obligation,net of accretion, related to the below market contract, less a small amount of depreciation and amortization that is not included as part of the recoverable costs.\nPrevious Results of the Chemtura AgroSolutions Business (Pre-Divestiture)\nNet sales of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business for the ten months ended October 31, 2014 were $381 million as compared with net sales of $449 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $371 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. Operating profit for the ten months ended October 31, 2014 was $80 million compared with $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $74 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.\nThe Chemtura AgroSolutions business did not have any third party sales subsequent to the date of sale to Platform. Therefore, to assist investors in understanding the business and its results of operations prior to the date of sale, the discussion that follows compares the first ten months of 2014 with the first ten months of 2013.\nChemtura AgroSolutions generated higher net sales and operating income for the first ten months of 2014 as compared with the same ten months of 2013. Net sales increased $10 million representing an $8 million increase in volume and a $10 million increase in sales price which was offset by $8 million in unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. Chemtura AgroSolutions experienced strong demand in Latin America due both to a high level of demand for pest control in the soybean market and the growth in cultivated acreage. Our European region experienced favorable weather conditions in Europe toward the end of the first half of 2014. There was some supply constraints on certain miticides in North America which offset some of the volume growth in the first half of 2014. Overall higher volumes and improved sales prices offset the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.\nOperating income increased $6 million primarily reflecting the benefit of favorable volume and product mix changes of $18 million and $10 million of increased sales prices offset in part by $9 million in higher SGA&R due primarily to an increase in our bad debt reserves related to certain customers in Brazil and Kazakhstan, $4 million in higher raw material, manufacturing and distribution costs and $7 million of unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation.\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not calculated or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). While we believe that such measures are useful in evaluating our performance, investors should not consider them to be a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the financial measures may differ from similarly titled financial measures used by other companies and do not provide a comparable view of our performance relative to other companies in similar industries. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015, 2014 and 2013 is calculated as follows:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operational facility closures, severance and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss (gain) on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agrochemical Manufacturing supply agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs associated with the sale of Chemtura AgroSolutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UK pension benefit matter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe believe that our cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under our U.S. and international credit facilities and our current cash and cash equivalents provide sufficient liquidity to maintain our current operations and capital expenditure requirements, repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, service our debt and pursue other strategic initiatives.\nThe following is a discussion on significant factors affecting our liquidity and use of capital resources.\nFinancing Facilities\nOur financing facilities are comprised of public debt, several loans and a revolving line of credit.\nSenior Notes\nIn July 2013, we issued in a registered public offering $450 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Senior Notes\"). As of December 31, 2015, $450 million remained outstanding. The 2021 Senior Notes are callable at any time prior to July 2016 at 100% of their value plus a make-whole premium. After July 2016 the 2021 Senior Notes are callable at pre-determined fixed rates under the terms described in the 2021 Senior Notes indenture.\nLoans\nIn August 2010, we entered into a Term Loan due 2016 with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto, for an aggregate principal amount of $295 million. On October 31, 2012, we exercised the accordion feature of our Term Loan and borrowed an additional $125 million. Repayments were made on the Term Loan in 2013 and 2014 with proceeds from the 2021 Senior Notes offering, sale of businesses and cash on hand. In May 2015, we made an additional\nrepayment of $42 million. As of December 31, 2015, $40 million remained outstanding under the Term Loan, which is now classified as short term borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as it matures in August 2016.\nWe maintain a 5 year secured credit facility of CNY 250 million (approximately $40 million) available through December 2017 (the China Bank Facility\u201d) with Agricultural Bank of China, Nantong Branch ( ABC Bank\u201d). The China Bank Facility has been used for funding construction of our manufacturing facility in Nantong, China and is secured by land, property and machinery of our subsidiary Chemtura Advanced Materials (Nantong) Co., Ltd.. Repayments of principal are made in semi-annual installments from December 2014 through December 2017. In December 2014 and January 2015, we repaid $5 million and $15 million, respectively, of the China Bank Facility with proceeds from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. As of December 31, 2015, $12 million remained outstanding under the China Bank Facility.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nIn December 2013, we entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility that provides for $175 million available to our domestic subsidiaries (the \"US ABL Facility\") and \u20ac60 million available to Chemtura Sales Europe B.V., a Netherlands subsidiary (the Foreign ABL Facility\u201d, and together with the US ABL Facility, the 2018 ABL Facility\u201d), subject in each case to availability under a borrowing base. The 2018 ABL Facility provides a $125 million letter of credit sub-facility.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had no borrowings under the 2018 ABL Facility. However, we had $14 million of outstanding letters of credit (primarily related to insurance obligations, environmental obligations and banking credit facilities) which utilized available capacity under the facility. At December 31, 2015, based upon the available borrowing base, we had approximately $186 million of undrawn availability under the 2018 ABL Facility.\nCovenants\nThese financing facilities, excluding the China Bank Facility, contain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to enter into certain transactions, such as creating liens, incurring additional indebtedness or repaying certain indebtedness, making investments, paying dividends, and entering into acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the maintenance covenant requirements of these financing facilities.\nFor further discussion of the financing facilities, see Note 7 - Debt in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn October 2014, the Board approved a share repurchase authorization of up to $500 million conditioned upon the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. In August 2015, the Board authorized an increase to the October 2014 authorization by $150 million, up to $650 million in the aggregate when combined with the October 2014 authorization, and extended the program to December 1, 2016.\nDuring 2015, we purchased 6.2 million shares for $150 million under this share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2015, $171 million remained outstanding under our share repurchase program.\nA further discussion of our share repurchase programs is included in Note 10 - Capital Stock and Earnings (Loss) per Common Share in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe shares are expected to be repurchased from time to time through open market purchases. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at the Board's discretion. The manner, price, number and timing of such repurchases, if any, will be subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d).\nDivestitures and Other Sources of Cash\nChemtura AgroSolutions Business Divestiture and On-going Supply Arrangements\nIn November 2014, we completed the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform Specialty Products Corporation (\"Platform\") for approximately $1 billion, consisting of $950 million in cash and 2 million shares of Platform's common stock. The purchase price was subject to customary post-closing adjustments and related expenses which were finalized during 2015 and resulted in additional net proceeds of $3 million.\nThe net cash after-tax proceeds from this sale were used in part to pay for repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program, retire the remaining balance of our 2018 Senior Notes, pre-pay a portion of our Term Loan in December 2014 and pre-pay a portion of our China Facility in two tranches in December 2014 and January 2015.\nUnder the terms of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (\"SAPA\") with Platform, we have retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and have continued to manufacture products for Platform under several supply agreements and a tolling agreement (collectively, the \"supply agreements\"). The supply agreements have minimum terms of between two and four years.\nThe supply agreements with Platform are designed to recover the cash costs incurred to manufacture the products under the agreement. As such, the supply agreements are considered below-market contracts for their full term. In 2014 we recorded an obligation of $230 million, on a discounted basis, which represents the loss of profit on the sale of these products over the terms of the supply agreements, including contractual obligations to continue supply for a period of up to 2 years after the termination of the contracts. The recognition of the obligation, along with the accretion of the obligation to its undiscounted value of $345 million, is being recorded as net sales on a straight-line basis over the term of each supply agreement. Although the recognition of the obligation will be recorded as net sales to the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment over this period, this recognition will not generate cash flows during the term of the supply agreements. The change in this obligation that is included in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $38 million.\nFor further discussion of the Chemtura AgroSolutions sale, see Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Divestitures\nIn December 2013, we sold our wholly owned subsidiaries that constituted our Consumer Products business. The assets of these subsidiaries included dedicated manufacturing plants in the U.S. and South Africa, to KIK for $300 million and the assumption by KIK of pension and other liabilities totaling approximately $8 million. The Consumer Products business developed, manufactured and sold performance chemicals to consumers for in-home and outdoor use.\nIn April 2013, we sold substantially all the assets of our antioxidant business (the \"Antioxidant Sale\") to SK Blue Holdings, Ltd. ( SK\u201d), an affiliate of SK Capital Partners III, L.P., and Addivant USA Holding Corp. (Addivant\") for $97 million, $9 million in preferred stock issued by Addivant and the assumption by SK and Addivant of pension, environmental and other liabilities totaling approximately $91 million.\nFor further discussion of our Discontinued Operations, see Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Uses of Cash\nRestructuring Initiatives\nIn November 2014, the Board approved a restructuring plan to reduce manufacturing costs, eliminate stranded costs arising from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business and reduce SG&A costs. The main component of these actions was headcount reductions. The total cash costs approved by the Board to implement this plan was $37 million, of which we incurred $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 for severance and related costs and $2 million in 2015 for professional fees and severance related costs related to the closure of our West Lafayette, IN facility that was initiated in February 2015. We do not anticipate incurring the full $37 million of approved costs to complete the remaining actions in 2016 under this plan.\nIn June 2014, our Board approved the closure of the Adrian, MI facility, when an option given to KIK as part of the sale of our Consumer Products businesses expired unexercised. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2014, our management approved further actions to consolidate our business' organizational structure. We expected the total cost of these initiatives to be approximately $7 million to $9 million, of which we incurred approximately $5 million as of December 31, 2015 to substantially complete these actions. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $4 million in 2014, which included $3 million for severance and related costs and $1 million for accelerated asset retirement obligations related to the Adrian, MI facility. We recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $1 million in 2015, which included primarily professional fees and demolition costs related to the Adrian, MI closure.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $159 million in 2015 compared with net cash used in operating activities of $78 million in 2014 and net cash provided by operating activities of $79 million in 2013. Changes in key accounts are summarized below:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(89\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and post-retirement health care liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, accounts receivable generated cash flows of $24 million since December 31, 2014, primarily driven by decreases in the accounts receivable balances of our Industrial Performance and Industrial Engineered segments. The Industrial Performance segment's decline in accounts receivable was the result of lower net sales and lower sales prices as we passed along a reduction in raw material costs to certain customers in accordance with formula based contract pricing agreements. Our Industrial Engineered segment's accounts receivable was lower due primarily to lower net sales, primarily related to volume declines coupled with an improvement in collections as compared to 2014. Accounts receivable in our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment also declined from last year due to improved collections from Platform.\nInventory used cash flows of $5 million since December 31, 2014 primarily driven by an increase in our Industrial Engineered segment's inventory balance due principally to a build of inventory coupled with unfavorable absorption variances that were capitalized into inventory during the fourth quarter of 2015 offset by an increase in our inventory reserves related to a discontinued product. This increase was offset by a decrease in inventory in our Industrial Performance segment primarily the result of lower raw material costs. Inventory in our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment remained consistent with levels at December 31, 2014.\nAccounts payable used cash flows of $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily the result of a decrease in accounts payable in our Industrial Performance segment most notably related to the lower cost of raw materials and the timing of our purchases coupled with lower capital spending for our Nantong, China facility since December 31, 2014. This decrease was offset by an increase in accounts payable in our Industrial Engineered segment principally related to negotiated longer payment terms with our vendors. Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment accounts payable decreased since December 31, 2015 due to the timing of production for Platform under the supply agreements.\nWe used $28 million of cash flow for pension and post-retirement health care liabilities in large part due to cash contributions to fund pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities of $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 which included $24 million for domestic plans and $7 million for international plans.\nCash flows from operating activities in 2015 were adjusted by the impact of certain non-cash and other charges, which primarily included depreciation and amortization expense of $93 million, stock-based compensation expense of $12 million and a loss on the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business of $4 million offset by the recognition of the obligation, net of accretion, for the below-market obligations with Platform of $38 million and a gain of $8 million recorded for the release of cumulative translation adjustment associated with the liquidation of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe impact of changes in working capital of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business through the date of sale in November 2014 are included in the table above. During the year ended December 31, 2014, accounts receivable represented a use of cash of $89 million since December 31, 2013, primarily driven by increases in the accounts receivable balances of our Agrochemical Manufacturing and Industrial Engineered segments. The Agrochemical Manufacturing segment's increase was primarily due to the increase in demand particularly in North America and Europe for the 2014 growing season, extended terms for certain products in North America, a reduction in the utilization of financing facilities with banks in Brazil coupled with an increase in amounts due from Platform related to production under the supply agreements. The increase in our Industrial Engineered segment accounts receivable was due primarily to stronger sales and longer payment terms in Asia during the last months of 2014 coupled with slower payments from customer in Europe.\nInventory represented a use of cash of $31 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by increases in inventory balances in our Agrochemical Manufacturing and Industrial Performance segments, offset by inventory decreases in our Industrial Engineered segment. Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment continued to build inventory both prior and\nsubsequent to the sale of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business in anticipation of the 2015 growing season. Increased inventory balances in our Industrial Performance segment from December 31, 2013 is primarily the result of higher raw material prices, lower sales volume in intermediate, inhibitor and detergent petroleum additive products and a build of inventory at our new Ankerweg, The Netherlands plant as production increased throughout 2014. These increases were offset by a reduction in inventory in our Industrial Engineered segment primarily related to additional sales volumes in Emerald InnovationTM 3000 products and clear brine fluids and lower unfavorable manufacturing variances capitalized in 2014 compared with 2013, offset by lower sales volumes for bromine based and PCC products.\nAccounts payable represented a source of cash of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily in our Industrial Performance segment due to higher inventory purchases.\nPension and post-retirement health care liabilities represented a use of cash of $27 million primarily due to the funding of benefit obligations offset by a charge of $21 million related to the settlement of a pension obligation. Cash contributions to fund pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities amounted to $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 which included $27 million for domestic plans and $22 million for international plans.\nCash flows from operating activities in 2014 were adjusted by the impact of certain non-cash and other charges, which primarily included a gain on the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business of $529 million (the cash flows associated with the gain being reported in investing activities), a deferred tax benefit of $274 million primarily related to a release of the U.S valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets, depreciation and amortization expense of $102 million, stock-based compensation expense of $14 million, loss on sale of discontinued operations of $9 million, loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7 million and the recognition of the obligation, net of accretion, for the below-market obligations with Platform of $6 million for two month period subsequent to the sale.\nDuring 2013, accounts receivable represented a use of cash of $20 million since the end of 2012 primarily driven by Industrial Performance segment. Our Industrial Performance segment showed some increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by the sales increases this segment experienced at the end of 2013. Inventory represented a use of cash of $13 million since December 31, 2012 primarily driven by our Industrial Performance segment which reported an increase in inventory to support increased demand while our Industrial Engineered segment increased due to the acquisition of the remaining 50% of our DayStar joint venture. Accounts payable provide cash to operations of $20 million during 2013 primarily relating to our Industrial Performance segment as a result of the inventory increase resulting from higher demand. Pension and post-retirement health care liabilities represented a use of cash of $59 million primarily due to the funding of benefit obligations. Pension and post-retirement contributions amounted to $57 million during 2013 which included $32 million for domestic plans and $25 million for international plans.\nCash flows from operating activities in 2013 were adjusted by the impact of certain non-cash and other charges, which primarily included loss on sale of discontinued operations of $180 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $123 million, loss on early extinguishment of debt of $50 million, stock-based compensation expense of $14 million and impairment charges for long-lived assets of $7 million offset by a gain of $13 million recorded for the release of cumulative translation adjustment associated with the liquidation of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nCash Flows from Investing and Financing Activities\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $23 million for 2015. Investing activities included capital expenditures of $80 million for U.S. and international facilities, environmental and other compliance requirements offset by proceeds from the sale of the Platform shares of $54 million. Also included in investing activities were remaining proceeds net of transaction costs of $3 million from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $871 million for 2014. Investing activities included proceeds net of transaction costs and cash transferred of $965 million, $3 million and $3 million from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, respectively, and $13 million from the collection of a receivable from the sale of our 50% interest in Tetrabrom Technologies Ltd. in 2011. Investing activities also included capital expenditures of $113 million for U.S. and international facilities, environmental and other compliance requirements.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $184 million for 2013. Investing included capital expenditures of $170 million for U.S. and international facilities, environmental and other compliance requirements along with $3 million for the acquisition of the remaining interest in our DayStar joint venture. Investing activities also included proceeds, net of transaction costs and\ncash transferred of $78 million and $249 million from the sale of our Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, respectively, $20 million return of capital from our ISEM joint venture and $10 million from the collection of a receivable from the sale in 2011 of our 50% interest in Tetrabrom Technologies Ltd.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $189 million for 2015. Financing activities primarily included the repurchase of $150 million of our common stock under our share repurchase programs, the repayment of $42 million in principal of the Term Loan, the repayment of $15 million of our facility with the Agricultural Bank of China, Nantong Branch and payments on other long-term borrowings of $3 million, which were funded through our business divestitures and cash on hand. Other financing sources in the period were proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $20 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $935 million for 2014. Financing activities primarily included the repurchase of $618 million of our common stock under our share repurchase programs, the repayment of $236 million in principal of the Term Loan, the purchase of the remaining 7.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (the \"2018 Senior Notes\") of $105 million (including the call premium of $4 million) and payments on other long-term borrowings of $9 million, which were funded through our business divestitures and cash on hand. Other financing sources in the period were borrowings for capital improvements related to our facility in Nantong, China of $16 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $10 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $80 million for 2013. Financing activities primarily included the repurchase of $354 million of the 2018 Senior Notes, payment of the related tender premium and consent fees of $42 million and repayment of $102 million in principal of the Term Loan using the proceeds from the issuance of the $450 million of 2021 Senior Notes and cash on hand. Cash on hand was also used to repurchase $54 million of our common stock under our share repurchase program and $12 million of debt issuance costs related to the 2021 Senior Notes financing and amendments to the Term Loan and ABL Facility. Other financing sources in the period were borrowings for capital improvements related to our new facility in Nantong, China of $17 million, a promissory note for information technology software licenses of $7 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $8 million.\nContractual Obligations and Other Cash Requirements\nWe have obligations to make future cash payments under contracts and commitments, including long-term debt agreements, lease obligations, environmental liabilities, post-retirement health care liabilities and other long-term liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other cash commitments as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations and Other Cash Commitments*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 and Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(b)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(c)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(d)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Post-retirement health care liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(e)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Additional information is provided in various footnotes (including Debt, Leases, Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans, Income Taxes, and Divestitures) in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (a) Our debt agreements include various notes and bank loans for which payments will be payable through 2021. Obligations by period reflect stated contractual due dates. We are not required to make any cash payments under our capital lease obligations, therefore these amounts are excluded from the table above. \n (b) Represents operating lease obligations primarily related to buildings, land and equipment. Such obligations are net of future sublease income and will be expensed over the life of the applicable lease contracts. During 2015, we made payments of $16 million for operating leases. \n (c) Represents interest payments and fees related to our 2021 Senior Notes, Term Loan, ABL Facility and other debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2015. Assumed interest rates are based upon rates in effect at December 31, 2015. \n (d) We have ongoing environmental liabilities for future remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation. We estimate that the ongoing environmental liability could range up to $76 million. We have recorded a liability for ongoing environmental remediation of $63 million at December 31, 2015. \n (e) We have post-retirement health care plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired and active employees and their beneficiaries. These plans are generally not pre-funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred, with the exception of certain inactive government related plans that are paid from plan assets.  Each year we spend in the range of $50 million - $60 million in capital spending to sustain existing operations including maintaining our plants, ensuring that they operate safely and generating efficiency improvements that support our other critical business and functional infrastructure.\nWe fund our defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus additional voluntary contribution amounts we deem appropriate. Estimated future funding requirements are highly dependent on factors that are not readily determinable. These include changes in legislation, returns earned on pension investments, labor negotiations and other factors related to assumptions regarding future liabilities. In 2015, we made contributions of $23 million to our domestic and international pension plans, which included a $14 million discretionary contribution to our qualified domestic plan. We also contributed $7 million to our post-retirement benefit plans (including payments made by us directly to plan participants). See Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d below for details regarding current pension assumptions. To the extent that current assumptions are not realized, actual funding requirements may be significantly different from those described below. The following table summarizes the estimated future funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans under current assumptions:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Funding Requirements by Period (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Qualified domestic pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International and non-qualified pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Represents minimum amounts required by law or contractual obligations. We may elect to make additional discretionary contributions as deemed appropriate consistent with our past practice.  We have substantial U.S. net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) as described in Note 9 - Income Taxes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. While our utilization of these NOLs is subject to annual federal NOL limitations under Internal Revenue Code ( IRC\u201d) Section 382, we expect they will substantially reduce the amount of U.S. cash tax payments we are required to make in the foreseeable future.\nOther Sources and Uses of Cash\nWe expect to finance our continuing operations, capital spending requirements and the remainder of our authorized stock repurchase program in 2015 with cash flows provided by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and the 2018 ABL Facility. Our long-term stated total leverage target remains approximately 2 times Adjusted EBITDA. We were close to this target on December 31, 2015.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 were $323 million, of which $171 million was held by Chemtura and our U.S. subsidiaries and $152 million was held by our direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures. The cash and cash equivalents of our foreign subsidiaries are used to fund working capital requirements, make cash contributions to various pension plans and fund capital expenditures. In light of these cash requirements, we consider undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested in their operations.\nIn addition to the letters of credit of $14 million and $15 million outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, we have guarantees that have been provided to various financial institutions. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $6 million and $10 million, respectively, in guarantees. The letters of credit and guarantees were primarily related to liabilities for insurance obligations, environmental obligations, banking and credit facilities, vendor deposits and European value added tax ( VAT\u201d) obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, such undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries totaled $481 million. Proceeds received by non-U.S. subsidiaries related to the divestiture of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business were substantially repatriated during 2014. Repatriation of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to adverse tax consequences given the potentially higher U.S. effective tax rates and withholding tax requirements in the source country. Estimating the range of tax liabilities that could arise from the repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries is not practicable at this time.\nSubsequent Event\nOn February 22, 2016, we announced that, in accordance with the selection made by Evercore Trust Company, N.A. (\"Evercore Trust\"), the independent fiduciary for the Chemtura Corporation Retirement Plan (the Plan\u201d), we entered into a purchase agreement with Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (\"Voya\"), a member of the Voya Financial, Inc. family of companies, for a group annuity contract that will transfer payment responsibility to Voya for retirement pension benefit benefits owed to approximately 5,000 of our retirees in the U.S. or their designated beneficiaries.\nBy irrevocably transferring the obligations to Voya, we will partially mitigate our exposure to our defined benefit pension plans and estimate a reduction in our overall projected pension benefit obligation in the range of $350 million to $375 million, based on the valuation date of February 17, 2016. The annuity purchase price will be funded by the assets of the Plan.\nWe expect to make a cash contribution to the Plan in the first quarter of 2016 of between $30 million and $40 million in order to maintain the Plan's funded status. We expect to incur a non-cash pension settlement charge in the range of $150 million to $170 million before tax during the first quarter of 2016 in connection with this group annuity purchase.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Accounting estimates and assumptions described in this section are those we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For all of these estimates, we note that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Actual results could differ from such estimates. The following discussion summarizes our critical accounting estimates. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements are discussed in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCarrying Value of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nWe have elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment procedures for all of our reporting units in accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Goodwill ( ASC 350-20\u201d) as of July 31, or sooner, if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units utilizing income and market approaches through the application of discounted cash flow and market comparable methods (Level 3 inputs as described in Note 14 - Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements). The assessment is required to be performed in two steps: step one to test for a potential impairment of goodwill and, if potential impairments are identified, step two to measure the impairment loss through a full fair value allocation of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit utilizing the acquisition method of accounting.\nWe continually monitor and evaluate business and competitive conditions that affect our operations and reflect the impact of these factors in our financial projections. If permanent or sustained changes in business or competitive conditions occur, they can lead to revised projections that could potentially give rise to impairment charges.\nFor further discussion of impairment charges, see Note - 3 Restructuring and Asset Impairment Activities in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are involved in environmental matters of various types in a number of jurisdictions. A number of such matters involve claims for material amounts of damages and relate to or allege environmental liabilities, including cleanup costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites and natural resource damages.\nEach quarter, we evaluate and review estimates for future remediation, operation and management costs directly related to remediation, to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts. For each site where the cost of remediation is probable and reasonably estimable, we determine the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site, the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan, the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by us and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur. At sites where we expect to incur ongoing operation and maintenance expenditures, we accrue on an undiscounted basis for a period of generally 10 years those costs which are probable and reasonably estimable.\nIn addition, it is possible that our estimates for environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified, further remediation measures be required or undertaken, current laws and regulations be modified or additional environmental laws and regulations be enacted.\nWe intend to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters. The resolution of environmental matters asserted against us could require us to pay remedial costs or damages, which are not currently determinable, that could exceed our present estimates, and as a result could have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Expense\nOur calculation of pension and other post-retirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of factors and assumptions. These factors and assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other relevant factors. Components of pension and other post-retirement benefits expense include interest and service costs on the pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other post-retirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 13 - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPension Plans\nPension liabilities are measured on a discounted basis and the assumed discount rate is a significant assumption. At each measurement date, the discount rate is based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our liabilities. At December 31, 2015, we utilized a discount rate of 4.10% for our domestic qualified pension plan compared to 3.80% at December 31, 2014. For the international and non-qualified plans, a weighted average discount rate of 3.46% was used at December 31, 2015, compared to 3.28% used at December 31, 2014. As a sensitivity measure, a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate for all plans would result in less than a million dollar decrease in pre-tax earnings for 2015.\nDomestic discount rates adopted at December 31, 2015 utilized an interest rate yield curve to determine the discount rate pursuant to guidance codified under ASC Topic 715, Defined Benefit Plans ( ASC 715\u201d). The yield curve is comprised of AA bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years. We discounted the annual cash flows of our domestic pension plans using this yield curve and developed a single-point discount rate matching the respective plan's payout structure.\nA similar approach was used to determine the appropriate discount rates for the international plans. The actual method used varies from country to country depending on the amount of available information on bond yields to be able to estimate a single-point discount rate to match the respective plan's benefit disbursements.\nOur weighted average estimated rate of compensation increase was 2.88% for applicable domestic and international pension plans combined at December 31, 2015. As a sensitivity measure, an increase of 25 basis points in the estimated rate of compensation increase would decrease pre-tax earnings for 2015 by an immaterial amount.\nThe expected return on pension plan assets is based on our investment strategy, historical experience and expectations for long-term rates of return. We determine the expected rate of return on plan assets for the domestic and international pension plans by applying the expected returns on various asset classes to our target asset allocation.\nWe utilized a weighted average expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% on all domestic plan assets and a weighted average rate of 5.66% for the international plan assets for 2015.\nAsset-class return expectations are set using a combination of historical and forward-looking analyses. Historical returns are evaluated based on an arithmetic average of annual returns derived from recognized passive indices, such as the S&P 500, for the major asset classes. We looked at the arithmetic averages of annual investment returns from passive indices, assuming a portfolio of investments that follow the current target asset allocation for the domestic plans over several business cycles, to obtain an indication of the long-term historical market performance. The historical return estimates that result for each asset class are reviewed and combined with a qualitative assessment of long-term relationships between asset classes before a return estimate is finalized. The qualitative analysis is targeted towards removing the effect of unsustainable short-term valuations or trends, or capturing structural changes that are not yet reflected in the historical data. The resulting capital market assumptions\nare meant to reflect return levels and behavior that are likely to prevail over longer time periods. The geometric return over the past 19 years, the maximum available period of time for the applicable indices, was 11.94%, and over the past 10 years it was 9.47%. Both of these values exceeded the 7.50% domestic expected return on assets for 2015.\nThe actual annualized return on plan assets for the domestic plans for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was approximately (1.2%) (net of investment expenses), which was below the expected return on asset assumption for the year. The international plans realized a weighted average return of approximately 0.7% in local currency terms and approximately (5.4%) in U.S. dollar terms. Changes in exchange rates resulted in currency losses of approximately $27 million on plan assets, which were more than offset by currency gains of approximately $36 million on benefit obligations for the international pension arrangements.\nOur target asset allocation for the domestic pension plans is based on investing 32% of plan assets in equity instruments, 58% of plan assets in fixed income investments and 10% in all other types of investments. At December 31, 2015, 28% of the portfolio was invested in equities, 61% in fixed income investments and 11% in real estate and other investments.\nWe have unrecognized actuarial losses relating to our pension plans which have been included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, but not in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The extent to which these unrecognized actuarial losses will impact future pre-tax earnings depends on whether the unrecognized actuarial losses are deferred through the asset-smoothing mechanism (the market related value as defined by ASC Topic 715-30, Defined Benefit Plans - Pensions ( ASC 715-30\u201d)), or through amortization in pre-tax earnings to the extent that they exceed a 10% amortization corridor, as defined by ASC 715-30, which provides for amortization over the average remaining participant career or life. The amortization of unrecognized net losses existing as of December 31, 2015 will result in a $16 million decrease to pre-tax earnings for 2016 ($11 million for the qualified domestic plans and $5 million for the international and non-qualified plans). Since future gains and losses beyond 2015 are a result of various factors described herein, it is not possible to predict with certainty to what extent the combination of current and future losses may exceed the 10 percent amortization corridor and thereby be subject to further amortization. At the end of 2015, unrecognized net losses amounted to $270 million for the qualified domestic plans and $137 million for the international and non-qualified plans. Of these amounts, $23 million of unrecognized losses for the domestic plans and $17 million of unrecognized gains for the international plans are deferred through the asset smoothing mechanism as required by ASC 715.\nThe pre-tax pension expense for all pension plans was $1 million in 2015. Pension (income) expense is calculated based upon certain assumptions including discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and expected salary and wage increases. Actual results that differ from the current assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and will affect pension expense in future periods.\nThe following table estimates the future pension expense (income), based upon current assumptions:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Expense (Income) By Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Qualified domestic pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International and non-qualified pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pension plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe impact of a 100 basis point change in the actual return on assets would not have a material impact on the pension (income) expense for the above years.\nWe participate in a multi-employer pension plan that provides defined benefits to certain employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The risks of participating in a multi-employer plan differ from those of a single employer plan. The net pension cost of a multi-employer plan is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. Contributions that we make to the plan are not segregated and may be used to fund benefits to employees of other participating employers. The future cost of the plan is dependent on a number of factors, including the funded status of the plan and the ability of other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations. If one employer stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligation of the plan may have to be assumed by the remaining participating employers.\nOur contributions to the multi-employer plan for 2015 and prior years have been insignificant. However, due to the withdrawal of certain employers from the plan, there is uncertainty regarding the impact on our future contributions, although any\nincremental future contributions are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. We will continue to assess our obligations and risks associated to the multi-employer plan, and update our disclosures accordingly.\nOther Post-Retirement Benefits\nWe provide post-retirement health and life insurance benefits for current retired and active employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents for certain domestic and international employee groups.\nThe discount rates we adopted for the valuation of the post-retirement health care plans were determined using the same methodology as for the pension plans. At December 31, 2015, we utilized a weighted average discount rate of 3.97% for post-retirement health care plans, compared to 3.70% at December 31, 2014. As a sensitivity measure, a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would result in an immaterial change in pre-tax earnings for 2015.\nAssumed health care cost trend rates are based on past and current health care cost trends, considering such factors as health care inflation, changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns, technological advances, and the overall health of plan participants. We use health care trend cost rates starting with a weighted average initial level of 4.55% for the domestic arrangements and grading up to an ultimate level of 5%. For the international arrangements, the weighted average initial rate is 6.50%, grading down to 5%.\nThe pre-tax post-retirement healthcare expense was $2 million in 2015 and is expected to approximate $1 million per year for years 2016 to 2020 based upon the various assumptions discussed above.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes payable reflect our current tax provision and management's best estimate of the current tax liability relating to the outcome of uncertain tax positions. If the actual outcome of uncertain tax positions differs from our best estimates, an adjustment to income taxes payable could be required, which may result in additional income tax expense or benefit.\nWe record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. We also record deferred tax assets for the expected future tax benefits of net operating losses and income tax credit carryforwards.\nValuation allowances are established when we determine that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Thus, changes in future results of operations could result in adjustments to our valuation allowances.\nWe anticipate that we will repatriate the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we decreased by $10 million the amount of the net deferred tax liability we provide for the U.S. tax consequences of these repatriations, primarily due to the repatriations as a result of the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we decreased by $25 million, the amount of the net deferred tax liability we provide for the U.S. tax consequences of these repatriations. We consider undistributed earnings of all other foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested in their operations. At December 31, 2015, such undistributed earnings deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations amounted to $481 million. Repatriation of undistributed earnings, currently deemed indefinitely reinvested, would require us to accrue and pay taxes in the future. Estimating the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated is not practicable at this time.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S (including federal and state) and foreign jurisdictions. The income tax returns for our entities taxable in the U.S. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment. We assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The economic benefit associated with a tax position will only be recognized if it is more likely than not that a tax position ultimately will be sustained. We adjust these liabilities, if necessary, upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law.\nWe have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $27 million and $28 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This decrease is primarily related to actual cash repatriations made during the current year that offset the liability established in prior years for deemed repatriations and settlements of tax audits in various domestic and foreign jurisdictions.\nACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nFor information on accounting developments, see Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOUTLOOK\nIn 2016, we plan to build upon the improvements in our earnings and cash flow we achieved in 2015 to further expand Chemtura's profitability. We expect to deliver that improvement by continuing to focus on managing what we can control.\u201d\nIn 2015, we laid the foundation for improved performance through our manufacturing and SG&A cost reduction programs and through our commercial and operational excellence programs. In 2016, we anticipate being able to sustain the cost reductions we delivered in 2015 and offset cost inflation by the application of continuous improvement and productivity initiatives. However, to achieve further profitability improvement, we plan to deliver growth in sales volume by executing upon our growth levers.\nThe foundation for sales volume growth in 2016 has been laid in recent years by our investments in new product introductions, product enhancements and manufacturing capacity expansion. These investments have been focused on leveraging secular growth opportunities. We do not anticipate any general economic improvements to assist us in gaining sales volume and we face the uncertainties that flow from the continuing reduction in the price of oil and the slowing of the Chinese economy.\nThe resulting gains in sales volume should continue to improve the utilization of most but not all of the manufacturing capacity we have added in recent years and thereby reduce our unit product costs. By the end of 2015, we had completed the commissioning of the third and final phase of our investment in our Nantong, China multi-purpose plant with the completion of the urethanes unit. While this unit will commence the production and sale of urethane products in 2016, the slowing of the Chinese economic growth leads us to conclude that the rate at which we may be able to build sales from all three Nantong manufacturing units will be slower than we had previously anticipated.\nIndustrial Performance Products has now been successful in establishing additional supply of the key raw material that had constrained the volume of high viscosity polyalphaolefin synthetic base-stocks they could produce in 2015. With increased raw material availability, we anticipate being able to serve customers' demand for these products, improving the utilization of both the Elmira, Canada and Amsterdam, The Netherlands manufacturing facilities. The investments this segment has made to increase our capacity to produce our inhibitor lubricant additives will permit them to serve the increasing demand for these products in 2016. This segment has also secured additional customer requirements for its urethane hot cast elastomer products. The anticipated increased sales of these products should lay the foundation for their 2016 volume growth.\nWithin Industrial Engineered Products, in 2016 we should see customers complete their adoption of our Emerald InnovationTM 3000 flame retardant used in styrene-based insulation foams, replacing HBCD of which we discontinued manufacturing in 2015. The improvements in operating efficiency made in late 2015 should enable us to increase Emerald Innovation\u2122 3000 production rates to serve increased customer demand. In addition, in light of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's decision on mercury and air toxics standards, we anticipate that demand for our GeoBrom\u00ae product used in mercury control applications should increase during 2016. This segment has also secured additional demand for its traditional and metalocene-based polymerization catalysts and its tin-based products that should continue the recovery in performance of the organometallics product line that commenced in 2015. These volume gains and other growth opportunities should more than offset any weakening of demand for our clear brine fluid products used in deep offshore oil and gas applications that may occur. As a result of the lower oil prices, producers are reducing their investment in exploration and it is likely that we may see some reduction in demand compared to 2015. However, we do not yet have visibility as to when in 2016 such declines may occur. In addition, we anticipate that the segment should reflect the full year benefit of the changes in sales prices of bromine and certain derivatives that occurred in 2015.\nIn February 2016, we made a decision to discontinue one of our product lines within the Industrial Engineered Products segment. Inventory associated with this product line has been written down to its net realizable value of zero in the fourth quarter of 2015. The value of the property, plant and equipment associated with this product line at December 31, 2015 was approximately $7 million. We are currently in the process of determining whether this property, plant and equipment has an alternative use and the amount, if any, of asset impairment we will take in the first quarter of 2016.\nDespite the low oil price, due to supply and demand conditions for certain of the raw materials we purchase, in 2016 we anticipate that raw material costs in the aggregate will modestly increase compared to the prior year.\nThe cash generated from our anticipated improved profitability in 2016 can be used to fund an increase in capital expenditures to approximately $100 million for the year as well as the growth in working capital required by higher net sales. As a result, we expect generation for the year to be comparable to 2015 before cash used to repurchase our shares under our Board authorized share repurchase program, the repayment of the remainder of our senior secured term loan on or before maturity, and the funding of cash contributions to our pension and other post-retirement benefits plans.\nWe continue to explore opportunities to accelerate value creation for our shareholders through gaining scale by acquisition or a combination with another company. We believe that through building scale in industrial specialty chemicals, we can diversify our market exposures and give our Company the critical mass to invest in innovative products and applications. Executing on a compelling transaction can accelerate the benefits from our focus on the organic growth of our existing portfolio businesses and permit us to sustain our track record of delivering significant value to our shareholders.\nThere are a number of risks to achieving our business plans as described in Item 1A - Risk Factors and summarized below in Forward Looking Statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nIn addition to historical information, this Report contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.

The forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed. Forward-looking information is intended to reflect opinions as of the date this Form 10-K was filed. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements to conform the statements to actual results or changes in our operations.\nOUR BUSINESS\nWe are a global, United States publicly traded specialty chemical company dedicated to delivering innovative, performance-driven engineered specialty chemical solutions which are used as additives, ingredients or intermediates that add value to our customers' end products. We are committed to global sustainability through greener technology\u201d and developing engineered chemical solutions that meet our customers' evolving needs. We operate in a wide variety of end-use industries, including automotive, building and construction, electronics, lubricants, packaging and transportation. We are a leader in many of our key product lines and transact business in approximately 90 countries. Our principal executive offices are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Middlebury, Connecticut.\nDuring 2013 and 2014, through a series of divestitures, we transformed ourselves from a diversified specialty chemical company into a company primarily serving the global industrial specialty chemical market.\nPrior to 2015 as part of our transformational initiatives, we divested several businesses that did not fit with our strategic objectives. In November 2014, we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform Specialty Products Corporation (\"Platform\"). The sale included the stock of certain subsidiaries, the dedicated manufacturing plants located at Gajraula, India and Pekin, Illinois, working capital and certain other assets as well as the assumption of certain liabilities. In December 2013, we completed the sale of our subsidiaries dedicated to the Consumer Products business to KIK Custom Products Inc. (\"KIK\"). The assets of those subsidiaries included dedicated manufacturing plants in the U.S. and South Africa. In April 2013, we completed an asset sale of our antioxidant and UV Stabilizer (the \"Antioxidant\") business to SK Blue Holdings, Ltd. (\"SK\") and Addivant USA Holdings Corp. (\"Addivant\"). The sale included dedicated manufacturing plants in the U.S., France, and Germany, and joint venture interests in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Korea. A further description of these transactions are provided in Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnder the terms of the sale agreement with Platform, we retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and have continued to manufacture products for Platform under several supply agreements and a tolling agreement (collectively, the supply agreements\u201d). The supply agreements have minimum terms of between two and four years. To reflect the change in the nature of operations, we changed the name of our Chemtura AgroSolutions segment to Agrochemical Manufacturing after the sale in 2014.\nOur commitment to this strategic change required us to reevaluate our remaining operations and management structure as well as our ability to increase operating efficiencies, reduce costs and increase value to our shareholders. In addition to the divestiture of our non-strategic businesses, in the fourth quarter of 2014, our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") approved a restructuring plan (the \"2014 Restructuring Plan\") to eliminate the stranded costs associated with our Chemtura AgroSolutions business, streamline the costs of our manufacturing operations and align our remaining operations and management structure for operating efficiencies designed to increase our business operating income and cash flows and build a platform for future organic growth. A further description of this restructuring initiative is provided in Note 3 - Restructuring and Asset Impairment Activities.\nWe entered 2015 a transformed company. We are comprised of two strategic business reporting segments, Industrial Performance Products and Industrial Engineered Products which, coupled with our Corporate reporting segment, are collectively referred to as our \"Core Segments\". In addition to our Core Segments, our Agrochemical Manufacturing reporting segment represents the ongoing activity with Platform under the supply agreements.\nThe primary economic factors that influence the operations and net sales of our Industrial Performance Products ( Industrial Performance\u201d) and Industrial Engineered Products ( Industrial Engineered\u201d) segments (collectively referred to as Industrials\u201d) are demand conditions in industrial, electronics, energy, residential and commercial construction, and transportation markets. Other factors affecting our financial performance include industry capacity, customer demand, raw material and energy costs, and sales prices. Sales prices are influenced by the global demand and supply for the products we produce, our ability to innovate and differentiate our products and competitor behavior. We seek to pursue sales prices that reflect the value our products deliver to our customers, while aiming to pass on higher raw material and energy costs to our customers to preserve our profit margins. The risks that may impact our performance are included in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE\nIn 2015, we substantially delivered on our commitments we had established for our transformed company despite being a smaller company and encountering some headwinds in the supply of certain raw materials and sluggish market demand conditions. Among the many accomplishments in 2015 were:\nImprovement Initiatives\n \u2022 We announced in late 2014 a cost reduction program to deliver $62 million annualized incurred cost savings indicating we would realize $50 million of savings in 2015. We delivered on that commitment and achieved our \"run-rate\" savings in incurred costs in the third quarter of 2015 although part of the benefit was offset by the absorption effect of lower sales volume. \n \u2022 We promptly eliminated the stranded costs associated with our former Chemtura AgroSolutions business. We also completed the closure of our West Lafayette, Indiana and Adrian, Michigan facilities. These actions together with the manufacturing and SG&A cost reduction program substantially completed the 2014 Restructuring Plan. \n \u2022 We increased the percentage of operating income to net sales in our Industrial Performance and Industrial Engineered segments by 520 basis points and 600 basis points, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared with prior year end despite a reduction in net sales for the same periods. The improvement came from the benefits of our cost reduction actions and from \"price-over-raw material costs\", among other factors. \n \u2022 We demonstrated substantial improvements in cash flow. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $159 million, an improvement of $237 million from 2014 when we used cash. Capital expenditures declined as planned from $113 million in 2014 to $80 million in 2015. \n \u2022 We continued to drive our commercial and operational excellence initiatives, improving our customers' experience and our operating effectiveness. \n \u2022 We continued to reduce the number of our legal entities, primarily through liquidation, eliminating the costs of regulatory and other compliance. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an $8 million gain due to the release of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments on these liquidations.  Share Repurchases\n \u2022 During 2015, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a cost of $150 million. As of December 31, 2015, $171 million remained outstanding under our Board authorized share repurchase program to fund further repurchases in 2016.  Debt Repayments\n \u2022 During 2015, we reduced our outstanding debt by $57 million primarily the result of payments made with proceeds from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business and cash on hand, lowering our total debt to $517 million as of December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 We reduced interest expense by $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared with the prior year end due to debt repayments made in 2015 and late 2014. \n \u2022 With the combination of improved operating profitability and cash flows and the reductions in debt outstanding, we ended 2015 with our total debt close to our long term financial goal of 2 times Adjusted EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA is defined in this section under the heading ADJUSTED EBITDA).  Other\n \u2022 During the second quarter of 2015, we sold 2 million shares of Platform common stock that we had received as part of the purchase price consideration when we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform in 2014 for net cash proceeds of $54 million. As a result of holding the shares, which were accounted for as available for sale securities, we reported a net gain of $3 million in the second quarter of 2015.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur management discussion and analysis of our results of operations relates to our business from continuing operations.\nThe sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business in November 2014 did not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation and, therefore, our results from continuing operations includes the historical financial information of that business through the date of sale. Given the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform in 2014, a discussion of the results of operations for the consolidated company for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is less meaningful to investors due to the sale and the change in the nature of the operations associated with our Agrochemical Manufacturing business from a market participant to a supplier of products to Platform under the supply agreements.\nWe determined that the most effective way to present to investors the change in results of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, as well as the comparison for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended December 31, 2013, is to provide separate discussions of the changes in our consolidated results for the Core Segments and then separately for the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment.\nUnder the headings \"2015 Compared to 2014\" and \"2014 Compared to 2013,\" we are providing a table which presents the results of operations of the consolidated Company including the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment through operating income. The table then segregates the results of operations for our Core Segments and our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment. The discussion of the components of operating income included in the section titled Overview only reflect changes related to the Core Segments. A separate discussion regarding the changes in results of operations of the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment is presented in each section under the heading Agrochemical Manufacturing\u201d.\nComponents of net income which are not included in operating income are affected by other factors in addition to the inconsistency in the results of operations after the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. We therefore have not included net income in the tables. As a result, the comparison discussions for the changes in those components which are not part of operating income are presented for the Company as a whole.\nFor a further discussion on the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business and the ongoing supply agreements with Platform, as well as the sale of our Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, see Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2015 COMPARED TO 2014\n\n(1) - Excludes depreciation and amortization expense which are shown separately.\nOverview\nConsolidated net sales of our Core Segments were $1.6 billion in 2015 or $179 million lower than in 2014 due to lower sales volume of $129 million, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38 million and lower sales prices of $12 million.\nThe larger portion of the decline in sales volume was attributable to our Industrial Engineered segment. Our Industrial Performance segment also reflected some sales volume declines as well as the effects of unfavorable product mix as compared with 2014. Our Industrial Engineered segment reported a decline in overall volume, despite volume improvement in the sales of our Emerald Innovation 3000\u2122 product used in the manufacture of insulation foam for building and construction applications and in clear brine fluids used in oilfield applications. However, due to the impact of a strike at a supplier of elemental bromine in the first half of 2015 and the disruptions in the import and export of hazardous materials in China as a result of the fire at the Tianjin, China port, we experienced a decline in sales volumes for our elemental bromine-based products and products used in energy and electronic applications. Additionally, decreased demand for flame retardant products used in furniture foam applications and the discontinuance of certain products late in 2014 and in 2015 led to further sales volume declines. Our Industrial Performance segment also experienced a decline in overall sales volume; however, unfavorable product mix particularly in the automotive, power generation, mining, oil and gas application products was a primary driver of lower net sales. Increased overall sales prices in our Industrial Engineered segment products were offset by sales price declines\nin our Industrial Performance segment due to our obligation to pass along the reductions in raw material costs resulting from lower oil prices to certain customers under formula based pricing contracts. Throughout 2015, we experienced the unfavorable effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar compared to other major currencies which reduced the U.S. Dollar value of our net sales denominated in foreign currencies.\nGross profit for our Core Segments in 2015 was $393 million, an increase of $49 million compared to $344 million in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 24% in 2015 compared with 19% in 2014. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to lower raw material costs resulting from lower oil prices, lower manufacturing costs as a result of our cost reduction initiatives, lower distribution costs and favorable foreign currency translation, partly offset by lower sales volume, unfavorable product mix and lower sales prices and a charge of $8 million related to an increase in our inventory reserves for a discontinued product.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense of $150 million was $45 million lower than 2014. Our SG&A for 2014 included a $21 million one-time charge related to the settlement of pension obligations and $18 million of expenses we incurred in connection with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. The remaining reduction in SG&A expense from 2014 is the result of our various cost savings initiatives that we announced at the end of 2014, including the elimination of stranded costs associated with our Chemtura AgroSolutions business, offset in part by higher cost accruals under our employee benefit and management incentive plans in 2015 compared to last year due to our improved performance.\nFacility closures, severance and related costs in 2015 were $3 million compared with $25 million for 2014. The expense related to the cost reduction initiatives we announced in 2014 and 2013. The restructuring plans in 2014 and 2015 related to both the elimination of stranded costs associated with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Consumer Products and Antioxidant businesses as well as initiatives to reduce manufacturing and SG&A costs within our Industrials businesses. Our restructuring plans are described in more detail in Note 3 - Restructuring and Assets Impairment Activities of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe loss on sale of business of $4 million in 2015 and the gain on sale of business of $529 million in 2014 are related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform in 2014 and the settlement of working capital adjustments and finalization of other post-closing terms of the sale and purchase agreement in 2015.\nOther Non-Operating Income and Expense\nThe following discussion about income and expense components that are not included in the computation of operating income are presented on a total company basis, which is the sum of the Core Segments and the Agrochemical Manufacturing Segment.\nInterest expense of $30 million during 2015 was $15 million lower than 2014, primarily the result of our repayments of debt utilizing net after-tax cash proceeds from the sale of Chemtura AgroSolutions.\nLoss on the early extinguishment of debt of $7 million for 2014 included a call premium and the write-off of unamortized capitalized financing costs and original issuance discount.\nOther income, net was $20 million for 2015 compared with $12 million for 2014. Other income, net in 2015 included a gain of $8 million related to the release of cumulative translation adjustments associated with the rationalization of certain European subsidiaries that were no longer required and a gain of $3 million related to the sale of the Platform shares. The remaining activity primarily reflected realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses, most significantly related to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies which began in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nThe income tax expense in 2015 was $16 million compared with a benefit of $192 million in 2014. The tax benefit reported in 2014 included a release of U.S. valuation allowance in the amount of $406 million and the tax expense related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. In 2014, we concluded that the positive evidence that we can utilize our U.S. deferred tax assets before they expire outweighed the negative evidence and as a result we released a majority of our U.S. valuation allowance.\nEarnings from continuing operations for 2015 was $136 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, as compared with $771 million, or $8.43 per diluted share in 2014. The after tax gain on the sale of Chemtura AgroSolutions and the tax benefit from the release of the majority of the valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets were the largest contributors to diluted earnings per share in 2014.\nEarnings from discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, which related to the Consumer Products business.\nLoss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, which primarily represented post-closing adjustments and obligations, settlement of working capital claims and fees associated with those adjustments and claims related to the sale of our Consumer Products business.\nThe following table describes the major factors impacting net sales and operating income for each of our segments:\n\n\n (a) Price over raw materials is the sum of the net changes in sales prices and the net changes in raw material costs between the two periods. As the reduction in the costs of certain raw materials result in certain circumstances in reductions in sales prices under certain contractual and negotiated agreements, the change in sales prices net of changes in raw material costs provides a better measure of the impact of sales price changes on our profitability (referred to as \"price over raw materials\").  The following is a discussion of the results of our segments for 2015 compared with 2014.\nIndustrial Performance Products\nOur Industrial Performance segment reported higher operating income on lower net sales for 2015 as compared with 2014.\nThe decline in net sales resulted from changes in product mix predominantly in our petroleum additive products coupled with overall lower sales volume in both petroleum additive and urethane product lines. Net sales further declined due to overall lower average sales prices, the result of lower raw material costs and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. As\n2015 progressed, we felt the effects of lower demand as our customer's began to manage inventory as demand in mining and oil and gas application products weakened. This weakening effected our product mix as we retained a higher volume of some of our lower margin products. Net sales were further impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies resulting in the value of net sales in foreign currency translating to lower U.S. Dollar sales in 2015 as compared with 2014. Overall lower sales prices particularly for our petroleum additive products were principally the result of our contractual and negotiated agreements that in certain circumstances result in reductions in sales prices when certain raw material costs decline.\nDespite the reduction in net sales, operating income compared with 2014 was $35 million higher due to the benefit of our ability to hold sales prices for our more specialty products, lower raw material and manufacturing costs and lower SG&A and research and development (\"R&D\", collectively, SGA&R\u201d) expense primarily the result of implementing many of the cost reduction initiatives we announced in 2014. The changes in foreign exchange rates provided a net benefit due to the location of our manufacturing footprint such that the reduction in foreign currency denominated production and administrative costs in U.S. dollar terms more than offset the unfavorable translation of foreign currency denominated net sales. These benefits more than offset the impacts of unfavorable volume and product mix described above.\nIndustrial Engineered Products\nOur Industrial Engineered segment reported lower net sales but higher operating income for 2015 compared with 2014.\nThe decline in net sales was primarily related to a decline in overall volume and product mix offset in part by increases in average sales prices. We experienced lower sales volume in our flame retardant products used in energy and electronic applications and in flexible urethane foams used in furniture applications coupled with a reduction in bromine products used in fine chemical applications offset in part by increases in demand for our Emerald Innovation 3000\u2122 product used in insulation foam applications in building and construction and clear brine fluids used in oilfield applications. The growth in net sales of clear brine fluids occurred despite the overall decline in oil and gas exploration in 2015. This is likely due to the timing of the completion of the deep water drilling projects in which our products are used and may not be indicative of future net sales for these products in these applications.\nDuring the first half of 2015, we experienced an interruption in the supply of elemental bromine due to a strike at a third-party supplier. While the strike ended early in the third quarter, it took until the end of the year for supply to fully recover. The fire and explosion at the Tianjin, China port in August caused disruptions to the import and export of hazardous materials in China which led to unfavorable volume impacts on certain of our products. Additionally, the discontinuance of sales of certain phosphorus-based flame products toward the end of 2014 and the discontinuation of sales of certain bromine based biocides when we closed our Adrian, MI manufacturing facility in June 2015 resulted in further sales volume declines year-over-year. Sales prices for our bromine and bromine derivative products started to recover as 2015 progressed, particularly for electronic flame retardant applications. This benefit was offset in part by unfavorable currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies in 2015.\nThe benefit of our cost savings initiatives and the increase in sales prices offset the reduction in net sales. In 2015, we generated $58 million in operating profit, a $42 million increase over 2014. The effect of sales volume declines on operating income were offset by the benefit of \"price over raw material\" costs, lower manufacturing and distribution costs and lower SGA&R. Operating profit in 2015 was impacted by an $8 million charge to increase our inventory reserves for a discontinued product. By the third quarter of 2015, we had realized the full benefit of our cost reduction initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2014, although part of that benefit was offset by the absorption effects of lower sales volume and the increase in our inventory reserves.\nCorporate\nIncluded in our general corporate expenses are costs of a general nature or managed on a corporate basis. These costs, net of allocations to the business segments, primarily represent corporate stewardship and administration activities together with costs associated with legacy activities and intangible asset amortization. Functional costs are allocated between the business segments and general corporate expense.\nCorporate expense was $64 million and $93 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which included amortization expense related to intangible assets and depreciation expense of $14 million and $16 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively. Our 2014 corporate expense included a one-time charge for $21 million in 2014 related to the settlement of a pension obligation and $18 million of non-recurring costs related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. The remaining increase in corporate expense in 2015 is the result of higher accruals under our employee benefit and management incentive plans in 2015 compared\nto last year due to improved performance coupled with higher accruals for environmental obligations and project costs partly offset by lower costs as a result of our cost savings initiatives.\nAgrochemical Manufacturing\nIn the first ten months of 2014, our Chemtura AgroSolutions business manufactured and resold agrochemical products to third party distributors and customers. In November 2014, we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform. Under the terms of the sale agreement with Platform, we retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and are continuing to manufacture products for Platform under the supply agreements. We operated under the supply agreements for the two months ended December 31, 2014 and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Therefore, the results of operations in 2014 are not comparable to the result of operations in 2015. In light of the incomparability, we have only provided discussion on the results of operations for 2015 and the net sales and operating profit of this segment prior to the sale in 2014.\nSupply Agreement Results\nThe supply agreements with Platform are designed to recover the actual cash costs incurred to manufacture the products under the agreements. Accordingly, the supply agreements are considered below-market contracts for their full term. Contemporaneous with the sale, we accrued in 2014 an obligation of $230 million, on a discounted basis, which represents the loss of profit on these products over the terms of the supply agreements, including contractual obligations to continue supply for a period of up to 2 years after termination of the supply agreements. The recognition of the obligation, along with the accretion of the obligation to its undiscounted value of $345 million, will be recorded as net sales on a straight-line basis over the term of each supply agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment net sales were $137 million, which included $38 million related to the recognition of our fulfillment of the obligation, net of accretion related to the below-market supply agreements. For the two month period ended December 31, 2014, the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment net sales were $22 million, which included $6 million related to the recognition of our fulfillment of the obligation, net of accretion related to the below-market supply agreements.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $35 million compared with $6 million for the two months ended December 31, 2014. As the contracts were designed to recover a majority of the costs incurred, operating income reflected the recognition of the obligation, net of accretion, related to the below market contract, less a small amount of depreciation and amortization that is not included as part of the recoverable costs.\nPrevious Results of the Chemtura AgroSolutions Business (Pre-Divestiture)\nNet sales of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business for the ten months ended October 31, 2014 were $381 million and operating income was $80 million.\n2014 COMPARED TO 2013\nOverview\n\n(1) - Excludes depreciation and amortization expense which are shown separately.\nOverview\nConsolidated net sales of our Core Segments were $1.8 billion in 2014 or $5 million higher than in 2013 driven by a $12 million increase in volume which was offset in part by a $4 million reduction in average sales prices and $3 million related to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. Our Industrial Performance segment reported an increase in sales which represented an increase in volume of our polyester polyols and sales price increases of our petroleum additive products offset by volume declines in our intermediate, detergents and inhibitor products. Our Industrial Engineered segment reported a decline in sales due to competition reducing sales prices for a number of our product lines and the decline in demand for our flexible foam application products weakened as the year progressed unfavorably impacting volume. Our Industrial Engineered segment delivered improvement in volume of our brominated performance products which was offset in part by declines in sales volumes for our polymerization co-catalysts products.\nGross profit for our Core Segments in 2014 was $344 million, an increase of $8 million compared to $336 million in 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of sales remained stable at 19% for both years. Gross profit in dollars increased due to the absence of a $21 million charge we took in 2013 related to costs to remediate a legacy non-operating site in France. Our gross profit was unfavorably impacted by the decrease in sales prices, an increase in raw material, distribution and manufacturing costs, and unfavorable product mix offset by the elimination of stranded costs associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses and other cost savings initiatives.\nSG&A expense of $195 million was $27 million higher than in 2013, primarily the result of a $21 million charge related to the settlement of pension obligations, $12 million of additional costs in 2014 associated with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business (exclusive of the amounts reported as part of the gain on sale) and $9 million in costs associated with our investment in business excellence initiatives. This was partially offset by $3 million in other pension matters primarily related to the absence of one-time charges that were recorded in 2013, a $3 million reduction in selling expense and the remainder in savings associated with the reduction of employee costs and benefits associated with our restructuring programs and the elimination of the stranded costs associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses.\nFacility closures, severance and related costs in 2014 was $25 million compared with $42 million for 2013. The expense related to the cost reduction initiatives we announced in 2014 and 2013. The restructuring plans related to both the elimination of stranded costs associated with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Consumer Products and Antioxidant businesses as well as initiatives to reduce manufacturing and SG&A costs within our Industrials businesses. Our restructuring plans are described in more detail in Note 3 - Restructuring and Assets Impairment Activities of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe gain on sale of business of $529 million in 2014 represented the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform.\nOther Non-Operating Income and Expense\nThe following discussion about income and expense outside of operating income is presented on a total company basis, which is the sum of the Core Segments and the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment.\nInterest expense of $45 million during 2014 was $15 million lower than 2013 due to our debt refinancing actions taken in the second half of 2013. The full benefit of our fourth quarter 2014 redemption of the outstanding 2018 Senior Notes and the pay down of the Term Loan due 2016 (the \"Term Loan\") are reflected in our 2015 results.\nLoss on the early extinguishment of debt of $7 million for 2014 included a call premium and the write-off of unamortized capitalized financing costs and original issuance discount. Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $50 million for 2013 included the difference between the principal amount of the 2018 Senior Notes tendered and the sum of the tender offer consideration and consent payments and the write-off of unamortized capitalized financing costs and original issuance discount.\nOther income, net was $12 million for 2014 compared with $8 million for 2013. Other income, net primarily reflected the net impact of foreign exchange gains and losses. In 2014, we realized foreign exchange gains and losses on the repayment of several foreign denominated intercompany loans between our subsidiaries in addition to significant fluctuations in the Euro and British Pound Sterling. In addition, during 2013, we recognized a gain of $13 million related to the release of cumulative translation adjustments associated with the rationalization of certain European subsidiaries that are no longer required.\nThe income tax benefit in 2014 was $192 million compared with expense of $18 million in 2013. The tax benefit reported in 2014 included a release of U.S. valuation allowance in the amount of $406 million and the tax expense related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. In 2014, we concluded that the positive evidence that we can utilize our U.S. deferred tax\nassets before they expire outweighed the negative evidence and as a result we released a majority of our U.S. valuation allowance. In 2013, tax expense was related to taxable income of certain of our international subsidiaries. In 2013, we provided a full valuation allowance against the tax expense associated with our U.S. net operating loss.\nEarnings from continuing operations for 2014 was $771 million, or $8.43 per diluted share, as compared with a loss from continuing operations of $22 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in 2013.\nEarnings from discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared with $25 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for 2013. Discontinued operations in 2013 represented the results of operations of our Antioxidants business through its sale in April 2013 and our Consumer Products business through its sale in December 2013. Additionally, in 2013, we recorded an impairment charge of $7 million which included the impairment of property, plant and equipment related to the Consumer Products business.\nLoss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax for 2014, was $9 million, or $0.10, per diluted share. The loss represented customary working capital adjustments of $1 million and $8 million associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products divestitures, respectively. Loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax for 2013, was $180 million, or $1.84, per diluted share which represented a net loss of $155 million and $25 million associated with the Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, respectively.\nThe following table describes the major factors impacting net sales and operating income for each of our segments:\n\n\n (a) Price over raw materials is the sum of the net changes in sales prices and the net changes in raw material costs between the two periods. As the reduction in the costs of certain raw materials result in certain circumstances in reductions in sales prices under certain contractual and negotiated agreements, the change in sales prices net of \nchanges in raw material costs provides a better measure of the impact of sales price changes on our profitability (referred to as \"price over raw materials\").\nThe following is a discussion of the results of our segments for 2014 compared with 2013.\nIndustrial Performance Products\nOur Industrial Performance segment reported higher net sales and lower operating income in 2014 compared with 2013.\nWe experienced overall volume declines in our intermediate, inhibitor and detergent petroleum additive products which was more than offset by volume improvement in our synthetic basestocks for finished fluid applications, Adiprene\u00ae/Vibrathane\u00ae products and polyester polyols. Net sales price increases were unable to offset the loss in volume. Overall sales price for our petroleum additive products was favorable to prior year but still fell short of covering increases in our raw material costs. Operating income reflected a favorable product mix of selling higher margin products than in 2013 which was offset in part by higher distribution and SGA&R.\nOperating income was $106 million in 2014, a decrease of $3 million compared with 2013. The decrease reflected higher raw material costs, an increase in SGA&R costs and additional accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment, offset by higher sales volume and favorable product mix, higher sales prices and favorable foreign currency translation.\nIndustrial Engineered Products\nOur Industrial Engineered segment reported lower net sales and operating income in 2014 compared with 2013.\nDuring 2014, we felt the effects of excess industry capacity in bromine and in polymerization co-catalysts products (\"PCC\"). The resulting competition driven by excess supply drove a reduction in our sales prices and resulted in lower volumes. We saw growth in the sales of our Emerald Innovation 3000TM products as customers switched to this alternative from traditional HBCD flame retardant styrene based insulation foam applications coupled with increased volume from international markets for our clear brine fluids used in energy markets partly offset the reductions in bromine based products and PCC volumes. Demand for flexible foam flame retardant products declined as the year progressed resulting in lower volumes. Towards the end of the year, sales prices for bromine products stabilized, but sales prices did not recover to 2013 levels. While we experienced a decrease in our raw material costs, the benefit was offset by the decline in sales prices, increase in sales of lower margin products, higher manufacturing and other costs and higher SGA&R expenses.\nOperating income of $16 million in 2014 decreased $39 million compared with last year. The decrease reflected unfavorable volume and product mix, lower sales prices, higher SGA&R costs, unfavorable foreign currency translation, higher distribution costs and an increase in other costs, offset by a decrease in raw material costs.\nCorporate\nCorporate expense was $93 million and $112 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, which included amortization expense related to intangible assets and depreciation expense of $16 million and $18 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively. Included in corporate expense in 2013 was a charge of $21 million to increase an environmental reserve for the costs to remediate a legacy non-operating site in France. Included in corporate expense in 2014 is a charge for $21 million related to the settlement of a pension obligation, an additional $12 million of costs incurred in the exploration and sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business over 2013, exclusive of the amount reported as part of the gain on sale, offset by $24 million related to the elimination of stranded costs associated with our Chemtura AgroSolutions business in 2014 and our Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses which were sold in 2013.\nAgrochemical Manufacturing\nIn 2013 and for the first ten months of 2014, our Chemtura AgroSolutions business manufactured and resold agrochemical products to third party distributors and customers. In November 2014, we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform. Under the terms of the sale agreement with Platform, we have retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and will continue to manufacture products for Platform under the supply agreements. We operated under the supply agreements for the two months ended December 31, 2014. Therefore, the results of operations for the previous Chemtura AgroSolutions business is not comparable to the Agrochemical Manufacturing business. The following represents a discussion of the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment on a go-forward basis and of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business on a pre-sale basis compared with 2013.\nSupply Agreement Results\nFor the two month period ended December 31, 2014, the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment's net sales were $22 million, which included $6 million related to the recognition of our fulfillment of the obligation, net of accretion related to the below-market supply agreements.\nOperating income for the two months ended December 31, 2014 was $6 million. As the contracts were designed to recover a majority of the costs incurred, operating income reflects only the recognition of the obligation,net of accretion, related to the below market contract, less a small amount of depreciation and amortization that is not included as part of the recoverable costs.\nPrevious Results of the Chemtura AgroSolutions Business (Pre-Divestiture)\nNet sales of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business for the ten months ended October 31, 2014 were $381 million as compared with net sales of $449 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $371 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. Operating profit for the ten months ended October 31, 2014 was $80 million compared with $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $74 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.\nThe Chemtura AgroSolutions business did not have any third party sales subsequent to the date of sale to Platform. Therefore, to assist investors in understanding the business and its results of operations prior to the date of sale, the discussion that follows compares the first ten months of 2014 with the first ten months of 2013.\nChemtura AgroSolutions generated higher net sales and operating income for the first ten months of 2014 as compared with the same ten months of 2013. Net sales increased $10 million representing an $8 million increase in volume and a $10 million increase in sales price which was offset by $8 million in unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. Chemtura AgroSolutions experienced strong demand in Latin America due both to a high level of demand for pest control in the soybean market and the growth in cultivated acreage. Our European region experienced favorable weather conditions in Europe toward the end of the first half of 2014. There was some supply constraints on certain miticides in North America which offset some of the volume growth in the first half of 2014. Overall higher volumes and improved sales prices offset the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.\nOperating income increased $6 million primarily reflecting the benefit of favorable volume and product mix changes of $18 million and $10 million of increased sales prices offset in part by $9 million in higher SGA&R due primarily to an increase in our bad debt reserves related to certain customers in Brazil and Kazakhstan, $4 million in higher raw material, manufacturing and distribution costs and $7 million of unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation.\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not calculated or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). While we believe that such measures are useful in evaluating our performance, investors should not consider them to be a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the financial measures may differ from similarly titled financial measures used by other companies and do not provide a comparable view of our performance relative to other companies in similar industries. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015, 2014 and 2013 is calculated as follows:\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe believe that our cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under our U.S. and international credit facilities and our current cash and cash equivalents provide sufficient liquidity to maintain our current operations and capital expenditure requirements, repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, service our debt and pursue other strategic initiatives.\nThe following is a discussion on significant factors affecting our liquidity and use of capital resources.\nFinancing Facilities\nOur financing facilities are comprised of public debt, several loans and a revolving line of credit.\nSenior Notes\nIn July 2013, we issued in a registered public offering $450 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Senior Notes\"). As of December 31, 2015, $450 million remained outstanding. The 2021 Senior Notes are callable at any time prior to July 2016 at 100% of their value plus a make-whole premium. After July 2016 the 2021 Senior Notes are callable at pre-determined fixed rates under the terms described in the 2021 Senior Notes indenture.\nLoans\nIn August 2010, we entered into a Term Loan due 2016 with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto, for an aggregate principal amount of $295 million. On October 31, 2012, we exercised the accordion feature of our Term Loan and borrowed an additional $125 million. Repayments were made on the Term Loan in 2013 and 2014 with proceeds from the 2021 Senior Notes offering, sale of businesses and cash on hand. In May 2015, we made an additional\nrepayment of $42 million. As of December 31, 2015, $40 million remained outstanding under the Term Loan, which is now classified as short term borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as it matures in August 2016.\nWe maintain a 5 year secured credit facility of CNY 250 million (approximately $40 million) available through December 2017 (the China Bank Facility\u201d) with Agricultural Bank of China, Nantong Branch ( ABC Bank\u201d). The China Bank Facility has been used for funding construction of our manufacturing facility in Nantong, China and is secured by land, property and machinery of our subsidiary Chemtura Advanced Materials (Nantong) Co., Ltd.. Repayments of principal are made in semi-annual installments from December 2014 through December 2017. In December 2014 and January 2015, we repaid $5 million and $15 million, respectively, of the China Bank Facility with proceeds from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. As of December 31, 2015, $12 million remained outstanding under the China Bank Facility.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nIn December 2013, we entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility that provides for $175 million available to our domestic subsidiaries (the \"US ABL Facility\") and \u20ac60 million available to Chemtura Sales Europe B.V., a Netherlands subsidiary (the Foreign ABL Facility\u201d, and together with the US ABL Facility, the 2018 ABL Facility\u201d), subject in each case to availability under a borrowing base. The 2018 ABL Facility provides a $125 million letter of credit sub-facility.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had no borrowings under the 2018 ABL Facility. However, we had $14 million of outstanding letters of credit (primarily related to insurance obligations, environmental obligations and banking credit facilities) which utilized available capacity under the facility. At December 31, 2015, based upon the available borrowing base, we had approximately $186 million of undrawn availability under the 2018 ABL Facility.\nCovenants\nThese financing facilities, excluding the China Bank Facility, contain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to enter into certain transactions, such as creating liens, incurring additional indebtedness or repaying certain indebtedness, making investments, paying dividends, and entering into acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the maintenance covenant requirements of these financing facilities.\nFor further discussion of the financing facilities, see Note 7 - Debt in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn October 2014, the Board approved a share repurchase authorization of up to $500 million conditioned upon the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. In August 2015, the Board authorized an increase to the October 2014 authorization by $150 million, up to $650 million in the aggregate when combined with the October 2014 authorization, and extended the program to December 1, 2016.\nDuring 2015, we purchased 6.2 million shares for $150 million under this share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2015, $171 million remained outstanding under our share repurchase program.\nA further discussion of our share repurchase programs is included in Note 10 - Capital Stock and Earnings (Loss) per Common Share in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe shares are expected to be repurchased from time to time through open market purchases. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at the Board's discretion. The manner, price, number and timing of such repurchases, if any, will be subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d).\nDivestitures and Other Sources of Cash\nChemtura AgroSolutions Business Divestiture and On-going Supply Arrangements\nIn November 2014, we completed the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform Specialty Products Corporation (\"Platform\") for approximately $1 billion, consisting of $950 million in cash and 2 million shares of Platform's common stock. The purchase price was subject to customary post-closing adjustments and related expenses which were finalized during 2015 and resulted in additional net proceeds of $3 million.\nThe net cash after-tax proceeds from this sale were used in part to pay for repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program, retire the remaining balance of our 2018 Senior Notes, pre-pay a portion of our Term Loan in December 2014 and pre-pay a portion of our China Facility in two tranches in December 2014 and January 2015.\nUnder the terms of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (\"SAPA\") with Platform, we have retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and have continued to manufacture products for Platform under several supply agreements and a tolling agreement (collectively, the \"supply agreements\"). The supply agreements have minimum terms of between two and four years.\nThe supply agreements with Platform are designed to recover the cash costs incurred to manufacture the products under the agreement. As such, the supply agreements are considered below-market contracts for their full term. In 2014 we recorded an obligation of $230 million, on a discounted basis, which represents the loss of profit on the sale of these products over the terms of the supply agreements, including contractual obligations to continue supply for a period of up to 2 years after the termination of the contracts. The recognition of the obligation, along with the accretion of the obligation to its undiscounted value of $345 million, is being recorded as net sales on a straight-line basis over the term of each supply agreement. Although the recognition of the obligation will be recorded as net sales to the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment over this period, this recognition will not generate cash flows during the term of the supply agreements. The change in this obligation that is included in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $38 million.\nFor further discussion of the Chemtura AgroSolutions sale, see Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Divestitures\nIn December 2013, we sold our wholly owned subsidiaries that constituted our Consumer Products business. The assets of these subsidiaries included dedicated manufacturing plants in the U.S. and South Africa, to KIK for $300 million and the assumption by KIK of pension and other liabilities totaling approximately $8 million. The Consumer Products business developed, manufactured and sold performance chemicals to consumers for in-home and outdoor use.\nIn April 2013, we sold substantially all the assets of our antioxidant business (the \"Antioxidant Sale\") to SK Blue Holdings, Ltd. ( SK\u201d), an affiliate of SK Capital Partners III, L.P., and Addivant USA Holding Corp. (Addivant\") for $97 million, $9 million in preferred stock issued by Addivant and the assumption by SK and Addivant of pension, environmental and other liabilities totaling approximately $91 million.\nFor further discussion of our Discontinued Operations, see Note 2 - Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Uses of Cash\nRestructuring Initiatives\nIn November 2014, the Board approved a restructuring plan to reduce manufacturing costs, eliminate stranded costs arising from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business and reduce SG&A costs. The main component of these actions was headcount reductions. The total cash costs approved by the Board to implement this plan was $37 million, of which we incurred $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 for severance and related costs and $2 million in 2015 for professional fees and severance related costs related to the closure of our West Lafayette, IN facility that was initiated in February 2015. We do not anticipate incurring the full $37 million of approved costs to complete the remaining actions in 2016 under this plan.\nIn June 2014, our Board approved the closure of the Adrian, MI facility, when an option given to KIK as part of the sale of our Consumer Products businesses expired unexercised. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2014, our management approved further actions to consolidate our business' organizational structure. We expected the total cost of these initiatives to be approximately $7 million to $9 million, of which we incurred approximately $5 million as of December 31, 2015 to substantially complete these actions. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $4 million in 2014, which included $3 million for severance and related costs and $1 million for accelerated asset retirement obligations related to the Adrian, MI facility. We recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $1 million in 2015, which included primarily professional fees and demolition costs related to the Adrian, MI closure.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $159 million in 2015 compared with net cash used in operating activities of $78 million in 2014 and net cash provided by operating activities of $79 million in 2013. Changes in key accounts are summarized below:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, accounts receivable generated cash flows of $24 million since December 31, 2014, primarily driven by decreases in the accounts receivable balances of our Industrial Performance and Industrial Engineered segments. The Industrial Performance segment's decline in accounts receivable was the result of lower net sales and lower sales prices as we passed along a reduction in raw material costs to certain customers in accordance with formula based contract pricing agreements. Our Industrial Engineered segment's accounts receivable was lower due primarily to lower net sales, primarily related to volume declines coupled with an improvement in collections as compared to 2014. Accounts receivable in our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment also declined from last year due to improved collections from Platform.\nInventory used cash flows of $5 million since December 31, 2014 primarily driven by an increase in our Industrial Engineered segment's inventory balance due principally to a build of inventory coupled with unfavorable absorption variances that were capitalized into inventory during the fourth quarter of 2015 offset by an increase in our inventory reserves related to a discontinued product. This increase was offset by a decrease in inventory in our Industrial Performance segment primarily the result of lower raw material costs. Inventory in our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment remained consistent with levels at December 31, 2014.\nAccounts payable used cash flows of $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily the result of a decrease in accounts payable in our Industrial Performance segment most notably related to the lower cost of raw materials and the timing of our purchases coupled with lower capital spending for our Nantong, China facility since December 31, 2014. This decrease was offset by an increase in accounts payable in our Industrial Engineered segment principally related to negotiated longer payment terms with our vendors. Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment accounts payable decreased since December 31, 2015 due to the timing of production for Platform under the supply agreements.\nWe used $28 million of cash flow for pension and post-retirement health care liabilities in large part due to cash contributions to fund pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities of $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 which included $24 million for domestic plans and $7 million for international plans.\nCash flows from operating activities in 2015 were adjusted by the impact of certain non-cash and other charges, which primarily included depreciation and amortization expense of $93 million, stock-based compensation expense of $12 million and a loss on the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business of $4 million offset by the recognition of the obligation, net of accretion, for the below-market obligations with Platform of $38 million and a gain of $8 million recorded for the release of cumulative translation adjustment associated with the liquidation of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe impact of changes in working capital of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business through the date of sale in November 2014 are included in the table above. During the year ended December 31, 2014, accounts receivable represented a use of cash of $89 million since December 31, 2013, primarily driven by increases in the accounts receivable balances of our Agrochemical Manufacturing and Industrial Engineered segments. The Agrochemical Manufacturing segment's increase was primarily due to the increase in demand particularly in North America and Europe for the 2014 growing season, extended terms for certain products in North America, a reduction in the utilization of financing facilities with banks in Brazil coupled with an increase in amounts due from Platform related to production under the supply agreements. The increase in our Industrial Engineered segment accounts receivable was due primarily to stronger sales and longer payment terms in Asia during the last months of 2014 coupled with slower payments from customer in Europe.\nInventory represented a use of cash of $31 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by increases in inventory balances in our Agrochemical Manufacturing and Industrial Performance segments, offset by inventory decreases in our Industrial Engineered segment. Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment continued to build inventory both prior and\nsubsequent to the sale of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business in anticipation of the 2015 growing season. Increased inventory balances in our Industrial Performance segment from December 31, 2013 is primarily the result of higher raw material prices, lower sales volume in intermediate, inhibitor and detergent petroleum additive products and a build of inventory at our new Ankerweg, The Netherlands plant as production increased throughout 2014. These increases were offset by a reduction in inventory in our Industrial Engineered segment primarily related to additional sales volumes in Emerald InnovationTM 3000 products and clear brine fluids and lower unfavorable manufacturing variances capitalized in 2014 compared with 2013, offset by lower sales volumes for bromine based and PCC products.\nAccounts payable represented a source of cash of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily in our Industrial Performance segment due to higher inventory purchases.\nPension and post-retirement health care liabilities represented a use of cash of $27 million primarily due to the funding of benefit obligations offset by a charge of $21 million related to the settlement of a pension obligation. Cash contributions to fund pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities amounted to $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 which included $27 million for domestic plans and $22 million for international plans.\nCash flows from operating activities in 2014 were adjusted by the impact of certain non-cash and other charges, which primarily included a gain on the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business of $529 million (the cash flows associated with the gain being reported in investing activities), a deferred tax benefit of $274 million primarily related to a release of the U.S valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets, depreciation and amortization expense of $102 million, stock-based compensation expense of $14 million, loss on sale of discontinued operations of $9 million, loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7 million and the recognition of the obligation, net of accretion, for the below-market obligations with Platform of $6 million for two month period subsequent to the sale.\nDuring 2013, accounts receivable represented a use of cash of $20 million since the end of 2012 primarily driven by Industrial Performance segment. Our Industrial Performance segment showed some increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by the sales increases this segment experienced at the end of 2013. Inventory represented a use of cash of $13 million since December 31, 2012 primarily driven by our Industrial Performance segment which reported an increase in inventory to support increased demand while our Industrial Engineered segment increased due to the acquisition of the remaining 50% of our DayStar joint venture. Accounts payable provide cash to operations of $20 million during 2013 primarily relating to our Industrial Performance segment as a result of the inventory increase resulting from higher demand. Pension and post-retirement health care liabilities represented a use of cash of $59 million primarily due to the funding of benefit obligations. Pension and post-retirement contributions amounted to $57 million during 2013 which included $32 million for domestic plans and $25 million for international plans.\nCash flows from operating activities in 2013 were adjusted by the impact of certain non-cash and other charges, which primarily included loss on sale of discontinued operations of $180 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $123 million, loss on early extinguishment of debt of $50 million, stock-based compensation expense of $14 million and impairment charges for long-lived assets of $7 million offset by a gain of $13 million recorded for the release of cumulative translation adjustment associated with the liquidation of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nCash Flows from Investing and Financing Activities\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $23 million for 2015. Investing activities included capital expenditures of $80 million for U.S. and international facilities, environmental and other compliance requirements offset by proceeds from the sale of the Platform shares of $54 million. Also included in investing activities were remaining proceeds net of transaction costs of $3 million from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $871 million for 2014. Investing activities included proceeds net of transaction costs and cash transferred of $965 million, $3 million and $3 million from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions, Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, respectively, and $13 million from the collection of a receivable from the sale of our 50% interest in Tetrabrom Technologies Ltd. in 2011. Investing activities also included capital expenditures of $113 million for U.S. and international facilities, environmental and other compliance requirements.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $184 million for 2013. Investing included capital expenditures of $170 million for U.S. and international facilities, environmental and other compliance requirements along with $3 million for the acquisition of the remaining interest in our DayStar joint venture. Investing activities also included proceeds, net of transaction costs and\ncash transferred of $78 million and $249 million from the sale of our Antioxidant and Consumer Products businesses, respectively, $20 million return of capital from our ISEM joint venture and $10 million from the collection of a receivable from the sale in 2011 of our 50% interest in Tetrabrom Technologies Ltd.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $189 million for 2015. Financing activities primarily included the repurchase of $150 million of our common stock under our share repurchase programs, the repayment of $42 million in principal of the Term Loan, the repayment of $15 million of our facility with the Agricultural Bank of China, Nantong Branch and payments on other long-term borrowings of $3 million, which were funded through our business divestitures and cash on hand. Other financing sources in the period were proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $20 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $935 million for 2014. Financing activities primarily included the repurchase of $618 million of our common stock under our share repurchase programs, the repayment of $236 million in principal of the Term Loan, the purchase of the remaining 7.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (the \"2018 Senior Notes\") of $105 million (including the call premium of $4 million) and payments on other long-term borrowings of $9 million, which were funded through our business divestitures and cash on hand. Other financing sources in the period were borrowings for capital improvements related to our facility in Nantong, China of $16 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $10 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $80 million for 2013. Financing activities primarily included the repurchase of $354 million of the 2018 Senior Notes, payment of the related tender premium and consent fees of $42 million and repayment of $102 million in principal of the Term Loan using the proceeds from the issuance of the $450 million of 2021 Senior Notes and cash on hand. Cash on hand was also used to repurchase $54 million of our common stock under our share repurchase program and $12 million of debt issuance costs related to the 2021 Senior Notes financing and amendments to the Term Loan and ABL Facility. Other financing sources in the period were borrowings for capital improvements related to our new facility in Nantong, China of $17 million, a promissory note for information technology software licenses of $7 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $8 million.\nContractual Obligations and Other Cash Requirements\nWe have obligations to make future cash payments under contracts and commitments, including long-term debt agreements, lease obligations, environmental liabilities, post-retirement health care liabilities and other long-term liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other cash commitments as of December 31, 2015.\n\n * Additional information is provided in various footnotes (including Debt, Leases, Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans, Income Taxes, and Divestitures) in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n (a) Our debt agreements include various notes and bank loans for which payments will be payable through 2021. Obligations by period reflect stated contractual due dates. We are not required to make any cash payments under our capital lease obligations, therefore these amounts are excluded from the table above. \n (b) Represents operating lease obligations primarily related to buildings, land and equipment. Such obligations are net of future sublease income and will be expensed over the life of the applicable lease contracts. During 2015, we made payments of $16 million for operating leases. \n (c) Represents interest payments and fees related to our 2021 Senior Notes, Term Loan, ABL Facility and other debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2015. Assumed interest rates are based upon rates in effect at December 31, 2015. \n (d) We have ongoing environmental liabilities for future remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation. We estimate that the ongoing environmental liability could range up to $76 million. We have recorded a liability for ongoing environmental remediation of $63 million at December 31, 2015. \n (e) We have post-retirement health care plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired and active employees and their beneficiaries. These plans are generally not pre-funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred, with the exception of certain inactive government related plans that are paid from plan assets.  Each year we spend in the range of $50 million - $60 million in capital spending to sustain existing operations including maintaining our plants, ensuring that they operate safely and generating efficiency improvements that support our other critical business and functional infrastructure.\nWe fund our defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus additional voluntary contribution amounts we deem appropriate. Estimated future funding requirements are highly dependent on factors that are not readily determinable. These include changes in legislation, returns earned on pension investments, labor negotiations and other factors related to assumptions regarding future liabilities. In 2015, we made contributions of $23 million to our domestic and international pension plans, which included a $14 million discretionary contribution to our qualified domestic plan. We also contributed $7 million to our post-retirement benefit plans (including payments made by us directly to plan participants). See Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d below for details regarding current pension assumptions. To the extent that current assumptions are not realized, actual funding requirements may be significantly different from those described below. The following table summarizes the estimated future funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans under current assumptions:\n\n (a) Represents minimum amounts required by law or contractual obligations. We may elect to make additional discretionary contributions as deemed appropriate consistent with our past practice.  We have substantial U.S. net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) as described in Note 9 - Income Taxes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. While our utilization of these NOLs is subject to annual federal NOL limitations under Internal Revenue Code ( IRC\u201d) Section 382, we expect they will substantially reduce the amount of U.S. cash tax payments we are required to make in the foreseeable future.\nOther Sources and Uses of Cash\nWe expect to finance our continuing operations, capital spending requirements and the remainder of our authorized stock repurchase program in 2015 with cash flows provided by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and the 2018 ABL Facility. Our long-term stated total leverage target remains approximately 2 times Adjusted EBITDA. We were close to this target on December 31, 2015.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 were $323 million, of which $171 million was held by Chemtura and our U.S. subsidiaries and $152 million was held by our direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures. The cash and cash equivalents of our foreign subsidiaries are used to fund working capital requirements, make cash contributions to various pension plans and fund capital expenditures. In light of these cash requirements, we consider undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested in their operations.\nIn addition to the letters of credit of $14 million and $15 million outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, we have guarantees that have been provided to various financial institutions. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $6 million and $10 million, respectively, in guarantees. The letters of credit and guarantees were primarily related to liabilities for insurance obligations, environmental obligations, banking and credit facilities, vendor deposits and European value added tax ( VAT\u201d) obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, such undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries totaled $481 million. Proceeds received by non-U.S. subsidiaries related to the divestiture of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business were substantially repatriated during 2014. Repatriation of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to adverse tax consequences given the potentially higher U.S. effective tax rates and withholding tax requirements in the source country. Estimating the range of tax liabilities that could arise from the repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries is not practicable at this time.\nSubsequent Event\nOn February 22, 2016, we announced that, in accordance with the selection made by Evercore Trust Company, N.A. (\"Evercore Trust\"), the independent fiduciary for the Chemtura Corporation Retirement Plan (the Plan\u201d), we entered into a purchase agreement with Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (\"Voya\"), a member of the Voya Financial, Inc. family of companies, for a group annuity contract that will transfer payment responsibility to Voya for retirement pension benefit benefits owed to approximately 5,000 of our retirees in the U.S. or their designated beneficiaries.\nBy irrevocably transferring the obligations to Voya, we will partially mitigate our exposure to our defined benefit pension plans and estimate a reduction in our overall projected pension benefit obligation in the range of $350 million to $375 million, based on the valuation date of February 17, 2016. The annuity purchase price will be funded by the assets of the Plan.\nWe expect to make a cash contribution to the Plan in the first quarter of 2016 of between $30 million and $40 million in order to maintain the Plan's funded status. We expect to incur a non-cash pension settlement charge in the range of $150 million to $170 million before tax during the first quarter of 2016 in connection with this group annuity purchase.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Accounting estimates and assumptions described in this section are those we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For all of these estimates, we note that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Actual results could differ from such estimates. The following discussion summarizes our critical accounting estimates. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements are discussed in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCarrying Value of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nWe have elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment procedures for all of our reporting units in accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Goodwill ( ASC 350-20\u201d) as of July 31, or sooner, if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units utilizing income and market approaches through the application of discounted cash flow and market comparable methods (Level 3 inputs as described in Note 14 - Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements). The assessment is required to be performed in two steps: step one to test for a potential impairment of goodwill and, if potential impairments are identified, step two to measure the impairment loss through a full fair value allocation of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit utilizing the acquisition method of accounting.\nWe continually monitor and evaluate business and competitive conditions that affect our operations and reflect the impact of these factors in our financial projections. If permanent or sustained changes in business or competitive conditions occur, they can lead to revised projections that could potentially give rise to impairment charges.\nFor further discussion of impairment charges, see Note - 3 Restructuring and Asset Impairment Activities in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are involved in environmental matters of various types in a number of jurisdictions. A number of such matters involve claims for material amounts of damages and relate to or allege environmental liabilities, including cleanup costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites and natural resource damages.\nEach quarter, we evaluate and review estimates for future remediation, operation and management costs directly related to remediation, to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts. For each site where the cost of remediation is probable and reasonably estimable, we determine the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site, the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan, the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by us and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur. At sites where we expect to incur ongoing operation and maintenance expenditures, we accrue on an undiscounted basis for a period of generally 10 years those costs which are probable and reasonably estimable.\nIn addition, it is possible that our estimates for environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified, further remediation measures be required or undertaken, current laws and regulations be modified or additional environmental laws and regulations be enacted.\nWe intend to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters. The resolution of environmental matters asserted against us could require us to pay remedial costs or damages, which are not currently determinable, that could exceed our present estimates, and as a result could have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Expense\nOur calculation of pension and other post-retirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of factors and assumptions. These factors and assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other relevant factors. Components of pension and other post-retirement benefits expense include interest and service costs on the pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other post-retirement benefits costs and obligations. See Note 13 - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPension Plans\nPension liabilities are measured on a discounted basis and the assumed discount rate is a significant assumption. At each measurement date, the discount rate is based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our liabilities. At December 31, 2015, we utilized a discount rate of 4.10% for our domestic qualified pension plan compared to 3.80% at December 31, 2014. For the international and non-qualified plans, a weighted average discount rate of 3.46% was used at December 31, 2015, compared to 3.28% used at December 31, 2014. As a sensitivity measure, a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate for all plans would result in less than a million dollar decrease in pre-tax earnings for 2015.\nDomestic discount rates adopted at December 31, 2015 utilized an interest rate yield curve to determine the discount rate pursuant to guidance codified under ASC Topic 715, Defined Benefit Plans ( ASC 715\u201d). The yield curve is comprised of AA bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years. We discounted the annual cash flows of our domestic pension plans using this yield curve and developed a single-point discount rate matching the respective plan's payout structure.\nA similar approach was used to determine the appropriate discount rates for the international plans. The actual method used varies from country to country depending on the amount of available information on bond yields to be able to estimate a single-point discount rate to match the respective plan's benefit disbursements.\nOur weighted average estimated rate of compensation increase was 2.88% for applicable domestic and international pension plans combined at December 31, 2015. As a sensitivity measure, an increase of 25 basis points in the estimated rate of compensation increase would decrease pre-tax earnings for 2015 by an immaterial amount.\nThe expected return on pension plan assets is based on our investment strategy, historical experience and expectations for long-term rates of return. We determine the expected rate of return on plan assets for the domestic and international pension plans by applying the expected returns on various asset classes to our target asset allocation.\nWe utilized a weighted average expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% on all domestic plan assets and a weighted average rate of 5.66% for the international plan assets for 2015.\nAsset-class return expectations are set using a combination of historical and forward-looking analyses. Historical returns are evaluated based on an arithmetic average of annual returns derived from recognized passive indices, such as the S&P 500, for the major asset classes. We looked at the arithmetic averages of annual investment returns from passive indices, assuming a portfolio of investments that follow the current target asset allocation for the domestic plans over several business cycles, to obtain an indication of the long-term historical market performance. The historical return estimates that result for each asset class are reviewed and combined with a qualitative assessment of long-term relationships between asset classes before a return estimate is finalized. The qualitative analysis is targeted towards removing the effect of unsustainable short-term valuations or trends, or capturing structural changes that are not yet reflected in the historical data. The resulting capital market assumptions\nare meant to reflect return levels and behavior that are likely to prevail over longer time periods. The geometric return over the past 19 years, the maximum available period of time for the applicable indices, was 11.94%, and over the past 10 years it was 9.47%. Both of these values exceeded the 7.50% domestic expected return on assets for 2015.\nThe actual annualized return on plan assets for the domestic plans for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was approximately (1.2%) (net of investment expenses), which was below the expected return on asset assumption for the year. The international plans realized a weighted average return of approximately 0.7% in local currency terms and approximately (5.4%) in U.S. dollar terms. Changes in exchange rates resulted in currency losses of approximately $27 million on plan assets, which were more than offset by currency gains of approximately $36 million on benefit obligations for the international pension arrangements.\nOur target asset allocation for the domestic pension plans is based on investing 32% of plan assets in equity instruments, 58% of plan assets in fixed income investments and 10% in all other types of investments. At December 31, 2015, 28% of the portfolio was invested in equities, 61% in fixed income investments and 11% in real estate and other investments.\nWe have unrecognized actuarial losses relating to our pension plans which have been included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, but not in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The extent to which these unrecognized actuarial losses will impact future pre-tax earnings depends on whether the unrecognized actuarial losses are deferred through the asset-smoothing mechanism (the market related value as defined by ASC Topic 715-30, Defined Benefit Plans - Pensions ( ASC 715-30\u201d)), or through amortization in pre-tax earnings to the extent that they exceed a 10% amortization corridor, as defined by ASC 715-30, which provides for amortization over the average remaining participant career or life. The amortization of unrecognized net losses existing as of December 31, 2015 will result in a $16 million decrease to pre-tax earnings for 2016 ($11 million for the qualified domestic plans and $5 million for the international and non-qualified plans). Since future gains and losses beyond 2015 are a result of various factors described herein, it is not possible to predict with certainty to what extent the combination of current and future losses may exceed the 10 percent amortization corridor and thereby be subject to further amortization. At the end of 2015, unrecognized net losses amounted to $270 million for the qualified domestic plans and $137 million for the international and non-qualified plans. Of these amounts, $23 million of unrecognized losses for the domestic plans and $17 million of unrecognized gains for the international plans are deferred through the asset smoothing mechanism as required by ASC 715.\nThe pre-tax pension expense for all pension plans was $1 million in 2015. Pension (income) expense is calculated based upon certain assumptions including discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and expected salary and wage increases. Actual results that differ from the current assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and will affect pension expense in future periods.\nThe following table estimates the future pension expense (income), based upon current assumptions:\n\nThe impact of a 100 basis point change in the actual return on assets would not have a material impact on the pension (income) expense for the above years.\nWe participate in a multi-employer pension plan that provides defined benefits to certain employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The risks of participating in a multi-employer plan differ from those of a single employer plan. The net pension cost of a multi-employer plan is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. Contributions that we make to the plan are not segregated and may be used to fund benefits to employees of other participating employers. The future cost of the plan is dependent on a number of factors, including the funded status of the plan and the ability of other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations. If one employer stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligation of the plan may have to be assumed by the remaining participating employers.\nOur contributions to the multi-employer plan for 2015 and prior years have been insignificant. However, due to the withdrawal of certain employers from the plan, there is uncertainty regarding the impact on our future contributions, although any\nincremental future contributions are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. We will continue to assess our obligations and risks associated to the multi-employer plan, and update our disclosures accordingly.\nOther Post-Retirement Benefits\nWe provide post-retirement health and life insurance benefits for current retired and active employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents for certain domestic and international employee groups.\nThe discount rates we adopted for the valuation of the post-retirement health care plans were determined using the same methodology as for the pension plans. At December 31, 2015, we utilized a weighted average discount rate of 3.97% for post-retirement health care plans, compared to 3.70% at December 31, 2014. As a sensitivity measure, a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would result in an immaterial change in pre-tax earnings for 2015.\nAssumed health care cost trend rates are based on past and current health care cost trends, considering such factors as health care inflation, changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns, technological advances, and the overall health of plan participants. We use health care trend cost rates starting with a weighted average initial level of 4.55% for the domestic arrangements and grading up to an ultimate level of 5%. For the international arrangements, the weighted average initial rate is 6.50%, grading down to 5%.\nThe pre-tax post-retirement healthcare expense was $2 million in 2015 and is expected to approximate $1 million per year for years 2016 to 2020 based upon the various assumptions discussed above.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes payable reflect our current tax provision and management's best estimate of the current tax liability relating to the outcome of uncertain tax positions. If the actual outcome of uncertain tax positions differs from our best estimates, an adjustment to income taxes payable could be required, which may result in additional income tax expense or benefit.\nWe record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. We also record deferred tax assets for the expected future tax benefits of net operating losses and income tax credit carryforwards.\nValuation allowances are established when we determine that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Thus, changes in future results of operations could result in adjustments to our valuation allowances.\nWe anticipate that we will repatriate the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we decreased by $10 million the amount of the net deferred tax liability we provide for the U.S. tax consequences of these repatriations, primarily due to the repatriations as a result of the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we decreased by $25 million, the amount of the net deferred tax liability we provide for the U.S. tax consequences of these repatriations. We consider undistributed earnings of all other foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested in their operations. At December 31, 2015, such undistributed earnings deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations amounted to $481 million. Repatriation of undistributed earnings, currently deemed indefinitely reinvested, would require us to accrue and pay taxes in the future. Estimating the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated is not practicable at this time.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S (including federal and state) and foreign jurisdictions. The income tax returns for our entities taxable in the U.S. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment. We assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The economic benefit associated with a tax position will only be recognized if it is more likely than not that a tax position ultimately will be sustained. We adjust these liabilities, if necessary, upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law.\nWe have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $27 million and $28 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This decrease is primarily related to actual cash repatriations made during the current year that offset the liability established in prior years for deemed repatriations and settlements of tax audits in various domestic and foreign jurisdictions.\nACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nFor information on accounting developments, see Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOUTLOOK\nIn 2016, we plan to build upon the improvements in our earnings and cash flow we achieved in 2015 to further expand Chemtura's profitability. We expect to deliver that improvement by continuing to focus on managing what we can control.\u201d\nIn 2015, we laid the foundation for improved performance through our manufacturing and SG&A cost reduction programs and through our commercial and operational excellence programs. In 2016, we anticipate being able to sustain the cost reductions we delivered in 2015 and offset cost inflation by the application of continuous improvement and productivity initiatives. However, to achieve further profitability improvement, we plan to deliver growth in sales volume by executing upon our growth levers.\nThe foundation for sales volume growth in 2016 has been laid in recent years by our investments in new product introductions, product enhancements and manufacturing capacity expansion. These investments have been focused on leveraging secular growth opportunities. We do not anticipate any general economic improvements to assist us in gaining sales volume and we face the uncertainties that flow from the continuing reduction in the price of oil and the slowing of the Chinese economy.\nThe resulting gains in sales volume should continue to improve the utilization of most but not all of the manufacturing capacity we have added in recent years and thereby reduce our unit product costs. By the end of 2015, we had completed the commissioning of the third and final phase of our investment in our Nantong, China multi-purpose plant with the completion of the urethanes unit. While this unit will commence the production and sale of urethane products in 2016, the slowing of the Chinese economic growth leads us to conclude that the rate at which we may be able to build sales from all three Nantong manufacturing units will be slower than we had previously anticipated.\nIndustrial Performance Products has now been successful in establishing additional supply of the key raw material that had constrained the volume of high viscosity polyalphaolefin synthetic base-stocks they could produce in 2015. With increased raw material availability, we anticipate being able to serve customers' demand for these products, improving the utilization of both the Elmira, Canada and Amsterdam, The Netherlands manufacturing facilities. The investments this segment has made to increase our capacity to produce our inhibitor lubricant additives will permit them to serve the increasing demand for these products in 2016. This segment has also secured additional customer requirements for its urethane hot cast elastomer products. The anticipated increased sales of these products should lay the foundation for their 2016 volume growth.\nWithin Industrial Engineered Products, in 2016 we should see customers complete their adoption of our Emerald InnovationTM 3000 flame retardant used in styrene-based insulation foams, replacing HBCD of which we discontinued manufacturing in 2015. The improvements in operating efficiency made in late 2015 should enable us to increase Emerald Innovation\u2122 3000 production rates to serve increased customer demand. In addition, in light of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's decision on mercury and air toxics standards, we anticipate that demand for our GeoBrom\u00ae product used in mercury control applications should increase during 2016. This segment has also secured additional demand for its traditional and metalocene-based polymerization catalysts and its tin-based products that should continue the recovery in performance of the organometallics product line that commenced in 2015. These volume gains and other growth opportunities should more than offset any weakening of demand for our clear brine fluid products used in deep offshore oil and gas applications that may occur. As a result of the lower oil prices, producers are reducing their investment in exploration and it is likely that we may see some reduction in demand compared to 2015. However, we do not yet have visibility as to when in 2016 such declines may occur. In addition, we anticipate that the segment should reflect the full year benefit of the changes in sales prices of bromine and certain derivatives that occurred in 2015.\nIn February 2016, we made a decision to discontinue one of our product lines within the Industrial Engineered Products segment. Inventory associated with this product line has been written down to its net realizable value of zero in the fourth quarter of 2015. The value of the property, plant and equipment associated with this product line at December 31, 2015 was approximately $7 million. We are currently in the process of determining whether this property, plant and equipment has an alternative use and the amount, if any, of asset impairment we will take in the first quarter of 2016.\nDespite the low oil price, due to supply and demand conditions for certain of the raw materials we purchase, in 2016 we anticipate that raw material costs in the aggregate will modestly increase compared to the prior year.\nThe cash generated from our anticipated improved profitability in 2016 can be used to fund an increase in capital expenditures to approximately $100 million for the year as well as the growth in working capital required by higher net sales. As a result, we expect generation for the year to be comparable to 2015 before cash used to repurchase our shares under our Board authorized share repurchase program, the repayment of the remainder of our senior secured term loan on or before maturity, and the funding of cash contributions to our pension and other post-retirement benefits plans.\nWe continue to explore opportunities to accelerate value creation for our shareholders through gaining scale by acquisition or a combination with another company. We believe that through building scale in industrial specialty chemicals, we can diversify our market exposures and give our Company the critical mass to invest in innovative products and applications. Executing on a compelling transaction can accelerate the benefits from our focus on the organic growth of our existing portfolio businesses and permit us to sustain our track record of delivering significant value to our shareholders.\nThere are a number of risks to achieving our business plans as described in Item 1A - Risk Factors and summarized below in Forward Looking Statements.",
