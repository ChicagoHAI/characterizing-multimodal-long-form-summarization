Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nSynta Pharmaceuticals Corp. is a company that has historically focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel oncology medicines that have the potential to change the lives of cancer patients. In October 2015, we announced the decision to terminate for futility the Phase 3 GALAXY-2 trial of our novel heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor, ganetespib, and docetaxel in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma. Based on a review of a pre-planned interim analysis, the study's Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) concluded that the addition of ganetespib to docetaxel was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of overall survival compared to docetaxel alone.\nWe have also been evaluating several candidates from our proprietary Hsp90 inhibitor Drug Conjugate program, or HDC program, which leverages the preferential accumulation of Hsp90 inhibitors in tumors to selectively deliver a wide array of anti-cancer payloads. We are currently conducting studies for our first clinical candidate from the HDC program, STA-12-8666, in anticipation of potentially submitting an investigational new drug application, or IND, for STA-12-8666. While we have determined not to pursue an IND submission for STA-12-8666 in the immediate future, we may determine to do so at a later date.\nWe were incorporated in March 2000 and commenced operations in July 2001. Since that time, we were principally engaged in the discovery and development of novel drug candidates. As of December 31, 2015, we have raised an aggregate of approximately $868.9 million in cash proceeds to fund operations, including $665.9 million in net proceeds from private and public offerings of our equity, $30.5 million in gross proceeds from term loans and $167.2 million in non-refundable payments from partnering activities under prior collaborations, as well as $5.3 million from the exercise of common stock warrants and options. We have also generated funds from government grants, equipment lease financings and investment income.\nWe have historically devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of our drug candidates, as well as intellectual property prosecution. We currently do not have any drugs that are commercially available and none of our drug candidates have obtained approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or any similar foreign regulatory authority. Since our inception, we have had no revenues from product sales. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $706.2 million.\nKey Developments\nFollowing the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial in October 2015, we initiated a comprehensive review of our strategy. In November 2015, we committed to a restructuring that consisted primarily of a workforce reduction to better align our workforce to our revised operating plans, which included support of key ongoing ganetespib investigator-sponsored studies and continued effort on development of candidates from the HDC program, in particular STA-12-8666. The restructuring was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. Cash payments in connection with the workforce reduction, comprised principally of severance, unused vacation payments, benefits continuation costs and outplacement services, were approximately $2.6 million of which approximately $1.3 million was paid during the fourth quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $1.3 million was\naccrued in remaining restructuring-related payments that are expected to be substantially paid during the first quarter of 2016.\nAs announced in March 2016, in order to conserve cash while we continue to evaluate business alternatives to maximize value for stockholders, we committed to an additional restructuring in February 2016 that consisted primarily of a workforce reduction of 23 positions, including 19 research and development positions, to a total of 10 remaining positions. In connection with this restructuring, we discontinued a substantial portion of our research and development activities. Cash payments in connection with the workforce reduction, comprised principally of severance, unused vacation payments, benefits continuation costs and outplacement services, will be approximately $1.5 million. We expect the restructuring to be substantially completed during the first quarter of 2016 and the majority of the related cash payments to be paid during the first half of 2016. Employees directly affected by the restructuring have received notification and will be provided with severance payments.\nWe continue to conduct limited activities with respect to ganetespib and the candidates in the HDC program, including STA-12-8666. With the exception of ongoing clinical trials in ovarian cancer and sarcoma, we have undertaken efforts to wind down existing ganetespib investigator-sponsored clinical trials. We have also entered into strategic agreements to out-license two of our prior drug candidates, elesclomol and our calcium release-activated calcium channel (CRACM) inhibitor program. However, we no longer anticipate expending material resources on any of our current drug candidates.\nAs previously announced in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 1, 2016, reporting the restructuring of our workforce, we have been considering potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. Such strategic alternatives include, but are not limited to, a sale of the company, a business combination or collaboration, joint development and partnership opportunities, a distribution of all or a significant amount of cash to stockholders, and liquidation of the company. We do not know if we will be successful in pursuing any strategic alternative or that any transaction will occur; however, we are committed to pursuing a strategic direction that our Board of Directors believes is in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe cannot predict whether and to what extent we may continue drug development activities, if at all, and what our future cash needs may be for any such activities. We expect our $66.6 million in cash resources as of December 31, 2015, along with significantly lower operating expenses following the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial, subsequent restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months.\nOn December 3, 2015, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued inclusion on The NASDAQ Global Market under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). The notification letter states that pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) the Company will be afforded 180 calendar days, or until May 31, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of the Company's common stock must maintain a minimum bid closing price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. If we do not regain compliance by May 31, 2016, we may transfer to The NASDAQ Capital Market in order to receive an additional 180-day compliance period to comply. In order to be eligible for the transfer and additional time, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all of the initial listing requirements for The NASDAQ Capital Market, other than the minimum bid price requirement, and must notify NASDAQ in writing of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. While we intend to engage in efforts to regain compliance, and thus maintain our listing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance during the applicable time periods set forth.\nOur Oncology Candidates\nWe have a clinical-stage drug candidate in oncology (ganetespib) and a novel, proprietary small molecule cancer drug development program (the HDC program).\nGanetespib (Hsp90 Inhibitor)\nGanetespib is a novel, potent, small molecule inhibitor of Hsp90, a molecular chaperone which is required for the proper folding and activation of many cancer-promoting proteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 by ganetespib leads to the simultaneous degradation of many of these client proteins and the subsequent death or cell cycle arrest of cancer cells dependent on those proteins. A number of Hsp90 client proteins are also involved in the resistance of cancer cells to other anti-cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy. The ability to reduce cancer-cell drug resistance suggests that the combination of ganetespib with chemotherapies or other anti-cancer agents may provide greater benefit than those agents administered alone. In preclinical studies, ganetespib has shown potent anti-cancer activity against a broad range of solid and hematologic cancers, both as a monotherapy and in combination with a variety of anti-cancer treatment approaches including chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.\nOngoing Ganetespib Clinical Trials\nWe expect to continue to support the clinical trials in ovarian cancer and sarcoma described below by providing ganetespib drug supply and required safety and regulatory oversight until each of these respective studies conclude.\nGANNET53 Trial-Ganetespib in ovarian cancer\nGANNET53, a Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) research project funded by the European Commission, is a pan-European randomized trial designed to evaluate the combination of ganetespib and paclitaxel vs. paclitaxel alone in over 200 patients with metastatic, predominantly p53 mutant, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Preclinical models have shown that mutant p53 is critical to the growth and proliferation of these cancers. Many mutations render p53 unable to fold appropriately, leaving the protein highly dependent on Hsp90 for stability. Inhibition of Hsp90 destroys the complex between Hsp90 and mutant p53, leading to the degradation of the protein and cancer cell death. We believe that mutated p53 may to serve as a predictive biomarker for Hsp90 inhibitors such as ganetespib.\nHsp90 inhibition has also been shown to sensitize mutant p53 cancer cells to treatment with chemotherapies, as has been seen in preclinical studies evaluating ganetespib in other tumor types, supporting the planned trial design evaluating the combination of ganetespib and paclitaxel vs. paclitaxel alone.\nEnrollment of the safety lead-in Phase 1 portion of GANNET53 in centers in Austria, Belgium, France, and Germany began in July 2014 and is now complete. Initial results from the Phase 1 portion presented in June 2015 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting demonstrated the feasibility and tolerability of combining ganetespib and paclitaxel in this treatment setting. In June 2015, we announced that the first patient was enrolled into the randomized Phase 2 portion of the trial.\nWe expect completion of enrollment in this trial to occur in 2017; however, as GANNET53 is an investigator-sponsored trial, we do not ultimately control the enrollment timeline for the study.\nSARC 023-Ganetespib in Sarcoma\nSARC 023, sponsored by the Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC), is an open label Phase 1/2 trial of ganetespib in combination with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus in patients with refractory sarcoma, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). The Pediatric Subcommittee of ODAC reviewed the design of SARC 023, as well as pre-clinical data demonstrating the scientific rationale for studying this combination in a clinical trial. The Phase 1 portion of the study, which is currently ongoing, is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated/recommended dose of the combination.\nWe expect completion of enrollment in this trial to occur in 2017; however, as SARC 023 is an investigator-sponsored trial, we do not ultimately control the enrollment timeline for the study.\nOther Ganetespib Clinical Trials\nIn light of recent corporate developments, we have elected to no longer support other investigator-sponsored clinical trials with the exception of ensuring drug supply of ganetespib to currently enrolled patients deemed to be receiving medical benefit and providing required safety and regulatory monitoring. Our expectation is that no additional patients will be enrolled on ganetespib containing treatment arms of clinical studies other than the ovarian cancer and sarcoma trials described above. Our intent is to wind down the ganetespib containing arms in all other remaining investigator-sponsored trials by mid-2016.\nIncluded in these studies are the AML-LI (Less Intensive)-1 and AML-18 trials evaluating ganetespib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and the I-SPY 2 TRIAL (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular Analysis 2) evaluating ganetespib in women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced breast cancer.\nHDC Program\nIn September 2013, we announced the launch of a novel, proprietary small molecule cancer drug development program: the HDC program.\nHDCs are drug candidates consisting of an Hsp90 inhibitor (targeting moiety) joined to an anti-cancer agent (payload) via a cleavable chemical linker optimized for controlled release of payload drug inside cancer cells. HDCs are small molecules that do not rely on cell surface antigens for targeting and internalization for cellular uptake. Upon cell entry, typically via small molecule uptake (passive diffusion and possibly active transporter), HDCs can bind intracellular Hsp90 that is present in significant amounts in a wide range of cancers.\nUpon systemic administration HDCs have the potential to achieve significantly higher concentrations of active anticancer drugs (payloads) in tumors than the concentrations achieved when such anticancer drugs are given in their original, unconjugated form. It is important to note that such high concentrations are sustained over prolonged periods of time, thus significantly increasing the exposure of tumors to the anticancer drug relative to the exposure that can be achieved when such anticancer drugs are given in their original, unconjugated form.\nIn October 2013, we announced the publication of the first key patent application covering our proprietary HDC technology, which includes composition of matter claims covering HDC compounds, methods for identifying therapeutically effective compounds, and methods of use against a wide range of diseases and conditions. Any resulting patent, if issued, would expire no earlier than 2034.\nOur lead drug candidate from our HDC Program is STA-12-8666, a conjugate of an Hsp90 inhibitor bound to SN-38, the highly potent active metabolite of the widely used chemotherapy irinotecan.\nAs part of our strategic overview and in light of recent corporate developments, however, we have decided not pursue an IND submission for STA-12-8666 at this time.\nOther Candidates\nElesclomol (Mitochondria-Targeting Agent)\nIn January 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to further develop our drug candidate, elesclomol. We will no longer be performing research activities on this drug candidate and, as part of the arrangement, we will receive a minority interest and Board representation in the third party, payments based on achievement of certain development milestones and product royalties upon commercialization.\nCRACM Ion Channel Inhibitors\nIn May 2014, we entered into a license arrangement for our CRACM program, including two lead candidates and the associated intellectual property portfolio, with PRCL Research Inc. (PRCL), a company funded by TVM Life Science Venture VII and the Fonds de Solidarit\u00e9 des Travailleurs du Qu\u00e9bec, based in Montreal, Canada. PRCL's plans were to develop one of the two lead candidates licensed from us to proof-of-concept. We have recently been informed that PRCL has selected one of these candidates to move forward into IND enabling studies.\nWe hold a minority interest in PRCL and a seat on PRCL's Board of Directors. We are not required to provide any research funding or capital contributions to PRCL, and we are not required to perform any research activities related to these candidates. We are reimbursed by PRCL for intellectual property management costs in connection with the contributed intellectual property. If and when proof-of-concept is reached with either drug candidate, Eli Lilly and Company, which is an investor in TVM, will help manage the development program through one of its divisions and will have an option to acquire PRCL or its assets at the then fair value.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not yet generated any product revenue and may never do so. Our revenues to date have been generated primarily through our former collaboration and license agreements. The terms of these agreements included payment to us of upfront license fees, milestone payments, research and development cost sharing and royalties. We may seek to generate revenue from product sales and from future collaborative or strategic relationships. In the future, we expect any revenue we may generate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received and expenses incurred under future collaborations or strategic relationships, if consummated, and the amount and timing of payments we may receive upon the sale of our drug candidates, to the extent any are successfully commercialized.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense consists of costs incurred in connection with developing and advancing our drug discovery technology and identifying and developing our drug candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred.\nOur research and development expenses have consisted primarily of:\n\u2022 internal costs associated with research, preclinical and clinical activities;\n\u2022 payments to third party contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs;\n\u2022 costs associated with drug formulation and supply of drugs for clinical trials;\n\u2022 personnel related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and travel; and\n\u2022 overhead expenses, including rent and maintenance of our facilities, and laboratory and other supplies.\nWe do not know if we will be successful in developing any of our drug candidates. Because we may seek to out-license or sell our drug candidates to one or more parties, we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our drug candidates will be subject to future development or the timelines or capital requirements related to any such arrangement. Because of this uncertainty, the numerous risks and uncertainties related to drug development, clinical trials, regulatory requirements and product manufacturing, and the stage of development of our drug candidates, we are unable to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. The duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development, including with respect to:\n\u2022 the number of clinical sites included in the trial;\n\u2022 the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects;\n\u2022 the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials; and\n\u2022 the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials.\nOur expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals. In addition, we may obtain unexpected or unfavorable results from future clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others. A change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in any of our clinical trials, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control would evolve and therefore impact any potential future clinical development programs and plans over time.\nWe anticipate that overall research and development costs will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial for futility, restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, bonuses and related expenses for personnel in executive, finance, business and commercial development, investor and medical community relations, human resources and administrative functions. Other costs include stock-based compensation\ncosts, directors' and officers' liability insurance premiums, legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, fees for general legal, accounting, public-company requirements and compliance, and other professional services, as well as overhead-related costs not otherwise included in research and development.\nWe expect that general and administrative expense will increase in 2016 as compared to prior periods due to the re-allocation of facilities overhead costs that would otherwise be charged to research and development expense (until our facilities leases expire in the fourth quarter of 2016). This increase will be partially offset by lower personnel-related costs and stock compensation due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In connection with the restructuring in February 2016, we discontinued a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We are required to make estimates and judgments with respect to contract research accruals, the recoverability of long-lived assets and measurement of stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nCollaboration and License Agreements\nOur principal source of revenue to date has been our former collaboration and license agreements, which included upfront license payments, development milestones, reimbursement of research and development costs, potential profit sharing payments, commercial and sales-based milestones and royalties. The accounting for collaboration and license agreements requires subjective analysis and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about whether deliverables within multiple-element arrangements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual arrangement into separate units of accounting and to determine the arrangement consideration to be allocated to each unit of accounting.\nFor multiple-element arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011, we follow the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13-Multiple-deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU No. 2009-13). ASU No. 2009-13 amended certain provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605-Revenue Recognition. This standard addresses the determination of the unit(s) of accounting for multiple-element arrangements and how an arrangement's consideration should be allocated to each unit of accounting.\nPursuant to this standard, each required deliverable is evaluated to determine if it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting. For us this determination includes an assessment as to whether the deliverable has \"stand-alone value\" to the customer separate from the undelivered elements. The arrangement's consideration is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The estimated selling price of each deliverable is determined using the\nfollowing hierarchy of values: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, (ii) third-party evidence of selling price, or (iii) our best estimate of the selling price (BESP). The BESP reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis. We expect, in general, to use BESP for allocating consideration to each deliverable in future collaboration agreements. In general, the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is then recognized as the related goods or services are delivered limited to the consideration not contingent upon future deliverables. We did not recognize any revenue related to collaboration and license agreements during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nWe account for development milestones under collaboration and license agreements pursuant to ASU No. 2010-17 Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition (ASU No. 2010-17). ASU No. 2010-17 codified a method of revenue recognition that has been common practice. Under this method, contingent consideration from research and development activities that is earned upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment. We do not have any ongoing collaboration and license agreements under which milestones may be achieved.\nRoyalty revenues are based upon a percentage of net sales. Royalties from the sales of products will be recorded on the accrual basis when results are reliably measurable, collectability is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Commercial and sales-based milestones, which are based upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon sales thresholds, will be recognized in the period in which the respective sales threshold is achieved and collectability is reasonably assured. We do not have any ongoing collaboration and license agreements under which royalties or commercial and sales-based milestones may be achieved.\nAccrued Expenses and Accrued Contract Research Liabilities\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements. Given our current business, the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our operating results is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials. In connection with all of the foregoing service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided. The majority of our service providers, including contract research organizations, invoice us in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred, or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period, our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated. We currently reflect the effects of any changes in estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances directly in our operations in the period such change becomes known. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a net reduction in accrued contract\nresearch costs of approximately $2.9 million, principally as a result of the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial.\nOur arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed. We recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion. The date on which services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date, and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods. We recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations. Generally, these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial, monitoring the trial, closing the trial and preparing the resulting data. Costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial.\nWith respect to financial reporting periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers, the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs. In light of the foregoing, we do not believe our practices for estimating future expenses and making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future. Except for the change in estimate recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015, there were no changes in our estimates and accruals for contract service fees that had a material net effect on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees, officers and directors. We use the Black- Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value as it is the most appropriate valuation method for our option grants. The Black-Scholes model requires inputs for risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and expected lives of the options. Expected volatility is based upon the weighted average historical volatility data of our common stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected lives for options granted represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. We use the simplified method for determining the expected lives of options. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical data. This analysis is re-evaluated at least annually and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary.\nFor awards with graded vesting, we recognize compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the award on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nOur net loss included stock-based compensation costs in the amount of $4.3 million, $7.4 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and no income tax benefit related to our stock-based compensation arrangements for employee and non-employee awards. As of December 31, 2015, the total amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense was $7.0 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.8 years.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nRevenues\nThere were no revenues in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nResearch and Development Expense\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 / 2014\nComparison </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 / 2013\nComparison </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in millions)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ganetespib\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>43.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>56.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>64.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(13.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (24 </td> <td>)% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(7.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (12 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> STA-12-8666\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Elesclomol\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (60 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CRACM\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (67 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (67 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other early stage programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (61 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>54.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>68.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>71.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(14.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (21 </td> <td>)% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(3.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGanetespib\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our ganetespib program decreased by $13.5 million, including decreases of $3.4 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational and stock compensation resulting from a lower level of FTEs, and $10.1 million in external costs. Decreases in external costs principally resulted from lower costs incurred in 2015 in connection with the early termination of the GALAXY-2 trial in October 2015 for futility, and the close-outs of the GALAXY-1 trial, the ENCHANT-1 trial and other company-sponsored trials, as well as costs that were incurred in the first quarter of 2014 for validation manufacturing that were not incurred in 2015. These lower costs were partially offset by higher costs incurred in 2015 related to completion of enrollment in the I-SPY-2 trial that commenced in October 2014. We recorded a $2.9 million net reduction in accrued contract research costs during the fourth quarter of 2015, principally as a result of the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial. We anticipate that overall research and development costs in support of the ganetespib program will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial for futility, restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our ganetespib program decreased by $7.7 million, including decreases of $3.6 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $4.1 million in net decreases for external costs. Internal costs decreased principally due to available resources being allocated to our HDC program. External costs overall decreased due to lower costs incurred in 2014 related to the wind-down of the GALAXY-1 trial, the ENCHANT-1 trial and other company-sponsored trials, offset by the increase resulting from the advancement of the GALAXY-2 trial that commenced enrollment in April 2013 and the initiation of the I-SPY 2 breast cancer trial in October 2014. In addition, costs were incurred in 2013 for the conduct of NDA-supporting clinical pharmacology studies that were not incurred in 2014.\nSTA-12-8666\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our STA-12-8666 program increased by $6.5 million, including increases of $3.7 million for personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $2.8 million for external costs. In the first quarter of\n2015, we commenced pre-clinical development of our lead HDC candidate, STA-12-8666. Prior to commencing pre-clinical development in 2015, costs incurred under our STA-12-8666 program were reported under our early-stage programs. We anticipate that overall research and development costs in support of the STA-12-8666 program will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes and our decision not to pursue submitting an IND submission for STA-12-8666 in the immediate future.\nElesclomol\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our elesclomol program decreased by $0.3 million including decreases of $0.1 million for personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.2 million for external costs.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our elesclomol program increased by $0.4 million, principally due to increases of $0.1 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.3 million in external costs. These increases were principally related to the pace of the ongoing clinical trial in ovarian cancer.\nCRACM\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our CRACM program decreased by $0.2 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation. In May 2014, we entered into a license arrangement with PRCL under which we may conduct preclinical research activities in the future that would be reimbursed by PRCL.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our CRACM program decreased by $0.6 million, principally due to decreases of $0.4 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.2 million in external costs. These decreases were the result of a lower investment in the CRACM program as we sought a corporate partner. In May 2014, we entered into a license arrangement with PRCL under which we are not required to perform any research activities.\nEarly-stage programs\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our early stage programs decreased by $6.5 million, including decreases of $6.2 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.3 million in external costs. In 2015, we advanced our lead HDC candidate, STA-12-8666, into IND-enabling studies and began reporting these costs separately under the STA-12-8666 program. We anticipate that overall research and development costs in support of the HDC discovery program will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our early stage programs increased by $4.2 million, including increases of $4.1 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.1 million in external costs. These increases were principally the result of our investment in the HDC program that was announced in September 2013.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 / 2014\nComparison </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 / 2013\nComparison </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in millions)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(2.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (15 </td> <td>)% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2.3 million, including net decreases of $2.0 million in personnel-related costs, related overhead and stock compensation, and $0.3 million in external professional fees. The $2.0 million net decrease in internal costs was principally in connection with approximately $2.0 million in lower net compensation costs related to management changes in the position of President and Chief Executive Officer. In the first quarter of 2014, Safi Bahcall resigned and we recognized approximately $2.0 million in costs in connection with his separation agreement that were not incurred in 2015, including approximately $1.0 million in cash compensation being paid over two years and approximately $1.0 million in non-cash stock compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting and extended vesting period of certain of his stock options. We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in 2016 as compared to prior periods due to the re-allocation of facilities overhead costs that would otherwise be charged to research and development expense (until our facilities leases expire in the fourth quarter of 2016). This increase will be partially offset by lower personnel-related costs and stock compensation due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In connection with the restructuring in February 2016, we discontinued a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, general and administrative expenses remained at a constant level, including $1.1 million in net decreases in external professional fees principally related to lower patent prosecution costs, offset by an increase of $1.1 million in personnel-related costs, related overhead and stock compensation. The net increase in internal costs was principally related to management changes in the position of President and Chief Executive Officer. In March 2014, Safi Bahcall, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, resigned and we entered into a separation agreement with him. In the first quarter of 2014, we recognized approximately $2.0 million in costs in connection with this separation agreement, including approximately $1.0 million in cash compensation to be paid over two years and approximately $1.0 million in non-cash stock compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting and extended vesting period of certain of his stock options. In August 2014, we announced the hiring of Anne Whitaker, our new President and Chief Executive Officer and entered into an employment contract with her. In the third quarter of 2014, we recognized approximately $0.4 million in related upfront cash compensation for a sign-on bonus and relocation allowance. These increases were partially offset by executive compensation that was incurred in 2013 that was not incurred in 2014 while we conducted a search for a new President and Chief Executive Officer following Safi Bahcall's departure.\nInterest Expense, net\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 / 2014\nComparison </th> <th> </th> <th>2014/ 2013\nComparison </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in millions)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(1.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (50 </td> <td>)% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(0.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (15 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, interest expense decreased due to principal payments under the GECC Term Loan and the original three-year $2.0 million loan under the Oxford Term Loan.

The use of cash in these periods principally resulted from our losses from operations, as adjusted for non-cash charges for depreciation and stock-based compensation, and changes in our working capital accounts.\nIn 2015, our investing activities provided cash of $20.0 million, including the sales and maturities of marketable securities in our investment portfolio in the amount of $137.2 million, offset by the purchases of marketable securities in the amount of $117.1 million and purchases of property and equipment in the amount of $0.1 million. In 2014, our investing activities used cash of $8.8 million, including the purchases of marketable securities in the amount of $93.8 million and purchases of property and equipment in the amount of $0.1 million, offset by maturities of marketable securities in our investment portfolio in the amount of $85.1 million. In 2013, our investing activities used cash of $24.7 million, including the purchases of marketable securities of $114.2 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.8 million, offset by maturities of marketable securities in our investment portfolio in the amount of $90.3 million.\nOur financing activities provided cash of $40.4 million, $85.3 million and $69.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, we raised approximately $49.6 million in net cash proceeds, including $41.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of 25,300,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering in April 2015 and $7.7 million in net proceeds from sales of 3,614,511 shares of our common stock under the at-the-market issuance sales agreements with MLV. In 2014, we raised approximately $94.8 million in net cash proceeds, including $89.0 million in net proceeds from sales of 21,692,753 shares of our common stock under at-the-market issuance sales agreements with MLV, $5.0 million in a registered direct offering of 1,250,000 shares of our common stock to an affiliate of a director who is our largest stockholder and $0.8 million from the exercise of common stock options. In 2013, we raised approximately $71.7 million in net cash proceeds, including $57.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of 16,100,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering in November 2013, $13.5 million in gross proceeds from additional funding under the GECC Term Loan and Oxford Term Loan and $1.1 million from the exercise of common stock options. We repaid $9.2 million,\n$9.5 million and $2.6 million in principal payments in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in connection with the GECC Term Loan and the Oxford Term Loan. In January 2014, we began making 30 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. During the period from July 2012 through March 2013, we made 9 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. For the periods from April 2013 through December 2013 we made interest-only payments.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following tables summarize our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions).\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Contractual Obligations (as of December 31, 2015)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017\nthrough\n2018 </th> <th> </th> <th>2019\nthrough\n2020 </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GECC and Oxford Term Loans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development contracts(2)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes scheduled interest payments and an exit fee of $788,000 due at the time of the final payment of the outstanding principal under the GECC Term Loan.\n(2)Research and development contracts principally include contracts for human clinical studies, animal studies and clinical manufacturing.

Under the co-development agreement, this CRO was performing clinical research services under a reduced fee structure in exchange for a share of licensing payments and commercial revenues, if any, up to a specified maximum payment, which is defined as a multiple of the fee reduction realized. The maximum amount of the service fee discount was realized in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn accordance with the termination provisions of the Roche Agreement, all rights to the CRACM licensed compounds under the agreement were returned to us. In May 2014, we entered into a license arrangement with PRCL Research, Inc for two lead candidates and the associated intellectual property portfolio. We may pay Roche a low single-digit royalty on any potential future sales of the licensed products.\nIn accordance with the termination provisions of the GSK Agreement, all rights to the elesclomol program were returned to us. In January 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to further develop our drug candidate, elesclomol. We may pay GSK a low single-digit royalty on any potential future sales of elesclomol.\nUnder a license agreement, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $0.5 million if specified development milestones are met, as follows (in millions).\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Milestone </th> <th> </th> <th>Amount </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development-based milestones related to the conduct of clinical trials\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Development-based milestones related to regulatory submission and approval\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPublic and Registered Direct Offerings\nIn April 2015, we raised approximately $44.3 million in gross proceeds from the sale of an aggregate 25,300,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $1.75 per share, including 3,300,000 shares upon the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. Certain of our directors and their affiliates, including our largest stockholder, purchased an aggregate of 7,257,142 shares in this offering at the public offering price. The net offering proceeds to us were approximately $41.9 million after deducting underwriters' discounts, fees and commissions, and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn April 2014, we sold 1,250,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $4.01 per share in a registered direct offering to an affiliate of a director who is our largest stockholder. These shares were sold directly without a placement agent, underwriter, broker or dealer. The net proceeds to us were approximately $5.0 million after deducting offering expenses payable by the Company.\nIn November 2013, we raised approximately $60.4 million in gross proceeds from the sale of an aggregate 16,100,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $3.75 per share, including 14,000,000 shares in the initial offering and 2,100,000 shares upon the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. Certain of our directors and their affiliates, including our largest stockholder, purchased an aggregate of 5,183,333 shares in this offering. The net offering proceeds to us were approximately $57.1 million after deducting underwriters' discounts, fees and commissions, and other offering expenses payable by us.\nAt-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreements\nMLV & Co., LLC\nWe entered into at-the-market issuance sales agreements (May 2012, May 2014 and July 2014 Sales Agreements) with MLV & Co., LLC (MLV), pursuant to which we issued and sold shares of our common stock from time to time, at our option, through MLV as our sales agent. Sales of common stock through MLV were made pursuant to an \"at-the-market\" offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act). MLV used commercially reasonable efforts to sell the common stock based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions that we imposed). All shares were sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-187242). We paid MLV a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds. The May 2012 and May 2014 Sales Agreements were terminated by us upon the sale of substantially all stock authorized for sale under each such agreements. In October 2015, we terminated the July 2014 Sales Agreement.\nIn March and April 2014, we sold an aggregate of 6,588,875 shares of common stock pursuant to the May 2012 Sales Agreement for an aggregate of approximately $28.0 million in gross proceeds at an average selling price of $4.25 per share. Net proceeds to us were approximately $27.3 million after deducting commissions and other transactions costs.\nFrom May 2014 through July 2014, we sold an aggregate of 9,424,193 shares of common stock pursuant to the May 2014 Sales Agreement for an aggregate of approximately $40.0 million in gross proceeds at an average selling price of $4.24 per share. Net proceeds to us were approximately $39.2 million after deducting commissions and other transactions costs, including approximately $33.6 million from the sale of 8,060,244 shares in the second quarter of 2014 and approximately $5.6 million from the sale of 1,363,949 shares in July 2014.\nIn July 2014, we reserved up to $50 million under our shelf registration statement for issuance under the July 2014 Sales Agreement. In the third quarter of 2014, we sold an aggregate of 5,679,685 shares of common stock pursuant to the July 2014 Sales Agreement for an aggregate of approximately $23.0 million in gross proceeds at an average selling price of $4.05 per share. Net proceeds to us were approximately $22.5 million after deducting commissions and other transaction costs.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, we sold an aggregate of 3,614,511 shares of common stock pursuant to the July 2014 Sales Agreement for an aggregate of approximately $7.9 million in gross proceeds at an average selling price of $2.19 per share. Net proceeds to us were approximately $7.7 million after deducting commissions and other transaction costs.\nCowen and Company, LLC\nIn October 2015, we entered into an at-the-market issuance sales agreement (October 2015 Sales Agreement), with Cowen and Company, LLC (Cowen), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million, from time to time, at our option, through Cowen as our sales agent. Sales of common stock through Cowen may be made by any method that is deemed an \"at-the-market\" offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including by means of ordinary brokers' transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by us and Cowen. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Cowen will use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell the common stock based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). We are not obligated to make any sales of our common stock under the Sales Agreement. Any shares sold will be sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (file no. 333-206135). We will pay Cowen a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds. The October 2015 Sales Agreement may be terminated by us at any time upon 10 days' notice. No shares have been sold to-date under the October 2015 Sales Agreement.\nTerm Loans\nGeneral Electric Capital Corporation (GECC)\nIn March 2013, we amended our loan and security agreement entered into in September 2010 with GECC and one other lender, or the GECC Term Loan, and obtained $12.9 million in additional loan funding and, as a result, increased the principal balance to $22.5 million at March 31, 2013. Interest on the borrowings under the GECC Term Loan remains at the annual rate of 9.75%. We made interest-only payments for the period from April 2013 through December 2013. In January 2014, we began making 30 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. During the period from July 2012 through March 2013, we made 9 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. For the periods from April 2013 through December 2013 and prior to July 2012 we made interest-only payments. As of December 31, 2015, in accordance with the GECC Term Loan, $4.5 million in remaining principal payments is scheduled to be paid by June 2016, at which time we are obligated to pay an exit fee in the amount of $788,000. (See Note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOxford Finance Corporation (Oxford)\nIn March 2011, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Oxford and received $2.0 million in loan funding, and in December 2012, we entered into a loan modification agreement, as amended, under which we could elect to draw down up to an additional $0.6 million in equipment financing until June 30, 2013, which we collectively refer to herein as the Oxford Term Loan. As of June 30, 2013, the Company had fully utilized the $0.6 million in additional equipment financing. Interest on the borrowings under the Oxford Term Loan accrues at an annual rate of 13.35%. In May 2011, we began making 36 equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest on the initial $2.0 million outstanding balance that was fully paid in April 2014. We continue to make equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest on the $0.6 million in additional equipment financing. As of December 31, 2015, in accordance with the Oxford Term Loan, $107,000 in remaining principal payments is scheduled to be paid by July 2016. (See Note 9 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.)\nLiquidity\nFunding Requirements\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 the completion of the ongoing investigator-sponsored clinical trials of ganetespib;\n\u2022 the costs involved in conducting preclinical activities for our ganetespib and HDC programs;\n\u2022 the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022 the extent to which we may elect to continue drug development activities in the future, if at all; and\n\u2022 the timing and completion of any transaction that may result from our ongoing strategy review.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $66.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $31.1 million from $97.7 million as of December 31, 2014. This decrease principally reflects $49.6 million that we raised in net cash proceeds, including $41.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in a public offering and $7.7 million in net proceeds from sales of our common stock under the at-the-market issuance sales agreement with MLV, offset by cash used in operations and term loan principal payments as discussed under \"Cash Flows\" above.\nWe have not yet generated any product revenue and may never do so. We cannot predict whether and to what extent we may continue drug development activities, if at all, and what our future cash needs may be for any such activities. We expect our $66.6 million in cash resources as of December 31, 2015, along with significantly lower operating expenses following the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial, subsequent restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months. This estimate assumes no additional funding from new partnership agreements, equity financings or further sales under our ATM. The timing and nature of certain activities contemplated for the remainder of 2016 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources. We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-206135) under which we have up to $300 million in securities available for future issuance, including up to $100 million in shares of common stock that we have reserved and that may be offered and sold under the October 2015 Sales Agreement with Cowen. However, pursuant to the instructions to Form S-3, we only have the ability to sell shares under the shelf registration statement, during any 12-month period, in an amount less than or equal to one-third of the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates.\nWe may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials and conduct additional preclinical and discovery activities. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with future research and development activities.\nTo the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future operating and capital requirements, we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings or licensing arrangements. However, additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling convertible debt securities, further dilution to our existing stockholders may result. If we raise funds through collaboration agreements or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently. Conversely, we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.\nTax Loss Carryforwards\nFor tax years through 2015 we performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code that would limit our ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We determined that we experienced an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, in connection with our acquisition of Principia Associates, Inc. on September 20, 2002, but did not experience a change in ownership upon the effectiveness of our IPO, or any other equity offerings to date. As a result, the utilization of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change is limited. As of December 31, 2015, we have net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal tax purposes of approximately $578.1 million, after excluding net operating losses that have expired unused as a result of Section 382 limitations, with the remainder expiring in varying amounts through 2035 unless utilized. As of December 31, 2015, we have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $321.9 million, which will expire through 2035 unless utilized. The net operating loss carryforwards include approximately $1.4 million of deductions related to the exercise of common stock options. This amount represents an excess tax benefit and has not been included in the gross deferred tax asset reflected for net operating losses. The utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited if we experience future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCertain Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward- looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nSynta Pharmaceuticals Corp. is a company that has historically focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel oncology medicines that have the potential to change the lives of cancer patients. In October 2015, we announced the decision to terminate for futility the Phase 3 GALAXY-2 trial of our novel heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor, ganetespib, and docetaxel in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma. Based on a review of a pre-planned interim analysis, the study's Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) concluded that the addition of ganetespib to docetaxel was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of overall survival compared to docetaxel alone.\nWe have also been evaluating several candidates from our proprietary Hsp90 inhibitor Drug Conjugate program, or HDC program, which leverages the preferential accumulation of Hsp90 inhibitors in tumors to selectively deliver a wide array of anti-cancer payloads. We are currently conducting studies for our first clinical candidate from the HDC program, STA-12-8666, in anticipation of potentially submitting an investigational new drug application, or IND, for STA-12-8666. While we have determined not to pursue an IND submission for STA-12-8666 in the immediate future, we may determine to do so at a later date.\nWe were incorporated in March 2000 and commenced operations in July 2001. Since that time, we were principally engaged in the discovery and development of novel drug candidates. As of December 31, 2015, we have raised an aggregate of approximately $868.9 million in cash proceeds to fund operations, including $665.9 million in net proceeds from private and public offerings of our equity, $30.5 million in gross proceeds from term loans and $167.2 million in non-refundable payments from partnering activities under prior collaborations, as well as $5.3 million from the exercise of common stock warrants and options. We have also generated funds from government grants, equipment lease financings and investment income.\nWe have historically devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of our drug candidates, as well as intellectual property prosecution. We currently do not have any drugs that are commercially available and none of our drug candidates have obtained approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or any similar foreign regulatory authority. Since our inception, we have had no revenues from product sales. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $706.2 million.\nKey Developments\nFollowing the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial in October 2015, we initiated a comprehensive review of our strategy. In November 2015, we committed to a restructuring that consisted primarily of a workforce reduction to better align our workforce to our revised operating plans, which included support of key ongoing ganetespib investigator-sponsored studies and continued effort on development of candidates from the HDC program, in particular STA-12-8666. The restructuring was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. Cash payments in connection with the workforce reduction, comprised principally of severance, unused vacation payments, benefits continuation costs and outplacement services, were approximately $2.6 million of which approximately $1.3 million was paid during the fourth quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $1.3 million was\naccrued in remaining restructuring-related payments that are expected to be substantially paid during the first quarter of 2016.\nAs announced in March 2016, in order to conserve cash while we continue to evaluate business alternatives to maximize value for stockholders, we committed to an additional restructuring in February 2016 that consisted primarily of a workforce reduction of 23 positions, including 19 research and development positions, to a total of 10 remaining positions. In connection with this restructuring, we discontinued a substantial portion of our research and development activities. Cash payments in connection with the workforce reduction, comprised principally of severance, unused vacation payments, benefits continuation costs and outplacement services, will be approximately $1.5 million. We expect the restructuring to be substantially completed during the first quarter of 2016 and the majority of the related cash payments to be paid during the first half of 2016. Employees directly affected by the restructuring have received notification and will be provided with severance payments.\nWe continue to conduct limited activities with respect to ganetespib and the candidates in the HDC program, including STA-12-8666. With the exception of ongoing clinical trials in ovarian cancer and sarcoma, we have undertaken efforts to wind down existing ganetespib investigator-sponsored clinical trials. We have also entered into strategic agreements to out-license two of our prior drug candidates, elesclomol and our calcium release-activated calcium channel (CRACM) inhibitor program. However, we no longer anticipate expending material resources on any of our current drug candidates.\nAs previously announced in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 1, 2016, reporting the restructuring of our workforce, we have been considering potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. Such strategic alternatives include, but are not limited to, a sale of the company, a business combination or collaboration, joint development and partnership opportunities, a distribution of all or a significant amount of cash to stockholders, and liquidation of the company. We do not know if we will be successful in pursuing any strategic alternative or that any transaction will occur; however, we are committed to pursuing a strategic direction that our Board of Directors believes is in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe cannot predict whether and to what extent we may continue drug development activities, if at all, and what our future cash needs may be for any such activities. We expect our $66.6 million in cash resources as of December 31, 2015, along with significantly lower operating expenses following the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial, subsequent restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months.\nOn December 3, 2015, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued inclusion on The NASDAQ Global Market under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). The notification letter states that pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) the Company will be afforded 180 calendar days, or until May 31, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of the Company's common stock must maintain a minimum bid closing price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. If we do not regain compliance by May 31, 2016, we may transfer to The NASDAQ Capital Market in order to receive an additional 180-day compliance period to comply. In order to be eligible for the transfer and additional time, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all of the initial listing requirements for The NASDAQ Capital Market, other than the minimum bid price requirement, and must notify NASDAQ in writing of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. While we intend to engage in efforts to regain compliance, and thus maintain our listing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance during the applicable time periods set forth.\nOur Oncology Candidates\nWe have a clinical-stage drug candidate in oncology (ganetespib) and a novel, proprietary small molecule cancer drug development program (the HDC program).\nGanetespib (Hsp90 Inhibitor)\nGanetespib is a novel, potent, small molecule inhibitor of Hsp90, a molecular chaperone which is required for the proper folding and activation of many cancer-promoting proteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 by ganetespib leads to the simultaneous degradation of many of these client proteins and the subsequent death or cell cycle arrest of cancer cells dependent on those proteins. A number of Hsp90 client proteins are also involved in the resistance of cancer cells to other anti-cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy. The ability to reduce cancer-cell drug resistance suggests that the combination of ganetespib with chemotherapies or other anti-cancer agents may provide greater benefit than those agents administered alone. In preclinical studies, ganetespib has shown potent anti-cancer activity against a broad range of solid and hematologic cancers, both as a monotherapy and in combination with a variety of anti-cancer treatment approaches including chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.\nOngoing Ganetespib Clinical Trials\nWe expect to continue to support the clinical trials in ovarian cancer and sarcoma described below by providing ganetespib drug supply and required safety and regulatory oversight until each of these respective studies conclude.\nGANNET53 Trial-Ganetespib in ovarian cancer\nGANNET53, a Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) research project funded by the European Commission, is a pan-European randomized trial designed to evaluate the combination of ganetespib and paclitaxel vs. paclitaxel alone in over 200 patients with metastatic, predominantly p53 mutant, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Preclinical models have shown that mutant p53 is critical to the growth and proliferation of these cancers. Many mutations render p53 unable to fold appropriately, leaving the protein highly dependent on Hsp90 for stability. Inhibition of Hsp90 destroys the complex between Hsp90 and mutant p53, leading to the degradation of the protein and cancer cell death. We believe that mutated p53 may to serve as a predictive biomarker for Hsp90 inhibitors such as ganetespib.\nHsp90 inhibition has also been shown to sensitize mutant p53 cancer cells to treatment with chemotherapies, as has been seen in preclinical studies evaluating ganetespib in other tumor types, supporting the planned trial design evaluating the combination of ganetespib and paclitaxel vs. paclitaxel alone.\nEnrollment of the safety lead-in Phase 1 portion of GANNET53 in centers in Austria, Belgium, France, and Germany began in July 2014 and is now complete. Initial results from the Phase 1 portion presented in June 2015 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting demonstrated the feasibility and tolerability of combining ganetespib and paclitaxel in this treatment setting. In June 2015, we announced that the first patient was enrolled into the randomized Phase 2 portion of the trial.\nWe expect completion of enrollment in this trial to occur in 2017; however, as GANNET53 is an investigator-sponsored trial, we do not ultimately control the enrollment timeline for the study.\nSARC 023-Ganetespib in Sarcoma\nSARC 023, sponsored by the Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC), is an open label Phase 1/2 trial of ganetespib in combination with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus in patients with refractory sarcoma, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). The Pediatric Subcommittee of ODAC reviewed the design of SARC 023, as well as pre-clinical data demonstrating the scientific rationale for studying this combination in a clinical trial. The Phase 1 portion of the study, which is currently ongoing, is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated/recommended dose of the combination.\nWe expect completion of enrollment in this trial to occur in 2017; however, as SARC 023 is an investigator-sponsored trial, we do not ultimately control the enrollment timeline for the study.\nOther Ganetespib Clinical Trials\nIn light of recent corporate developments, we have elected to no longer support other investigator-sponsored clinical trials with the exception of ensuring drug supply of ganetespib to currently enrolled patients deemed to be receiving medical benefit and providing required safety and regulatory monitoring. Our expectation is that no additional patients will be enrolled on ganetespib containing treatment arms of clinical studies other than the ovarian cancer and sarcoma trials described above. Our intent is to wind down the ganetespib containing arms in all other remaining investigator-sponsored trials by mid-2016.\nIncluded in these studies are the AML-LI (Less Intensive)-1 and AML-18 trials evaluating ganetespib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and the I-SPY 2 TRIAL (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular Analysis 2) evaluating ganetespib in women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced breast cancer.\nHDC Program\nIn September 2013, we announced the launch of a novel, proprietary small molecule cancer drug development program: the HDC program.\nHDCs are drug candidates consisting of an Hsp90 inhibitor (targeting moiety) joined to an anti-cancer agent (payload) via a cleavable chemical linker optimized for controlled release of payload drug inside cancer cells. HDCs are small molecules that do not rely on cell surface antigens for targeting and internalization for cellular uptake. Upon cell entry, typically via small molecule uptake (passive diffusion and possibly active transporter), HDCs can bind intracellular Hsp90 that is present in significant amounts in a wide range of cancers.\nUpon systemic administration HDCs have the potential to achieve significantly higher concentrations of active anticancer drugs (payloads) in tumors than the concentrations achieved when such anticancer drugs are given in their original, unconjugated form. It is important to note that such high concentrations are sustained over prolonged periods of time, thus significantly increasing the exposure of tumors to the anticancer drug relative to the exposure that can be achieved when such anticancer drugs are given in their original, unconjugated form.\nIn October 2013, we announced the publication of the first key patent application covering our proprietary HDC technology, which includes composition of matter claims covering HDC compounds, methods for identifying therapeutically effective compounds, and methods of use against a wide range of diseases and conditions. Any resulting patent, if issued, would expire no earlier than 2034.\nOur lead drug candidate from our HDC Program is STA-12-8666, a conjugate of an Hsp90 inhibitor bound to SN-38, the highly potent active metabolite of the widely used chemotherapy irinotecan.\nAs part of our strategic overview and in light of recent corporate developments, however, we have decided not pursue an IND submission for STA-12-8666 at this time.\nOther Candidates\nElesclomol (Mitochondria-Targeting Agent)\nIn January 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to further develop our drug candidate, elesclomol. We will no longer be performing research activities on this drug candidate and, as part of the arrangement, we will receive a minority interest and Board representation in the third party, payments based on achievement of certain development milestones and product royalties upon commercialization.\nCRACM Ion Channel Inhibitors\nIn May 2014, we entered into a license arrangement for our CRACM program, including two lead candidates and the associated intellectual property portfolio, with PRCL Research Inc. (PRCL), a company funded by TVM Life Science Venture VII and the Fonds de Solidarit\u00e9 des Travailleurs du Qu\u00e9bec, based in Montreal, Canada. PRCL's plans were to develop one of the two lead candidates licensed from us to proof-of-concept. We have recently been informed that PRCL has selected one of these candidates to move forward into IND enabling studies.\nWe hold a minority interest in PRCL and a seat on PRCL's Board of Directors. We are not required to provide any research funding or capital contributions to PRCL, and we are not required to perform any research activities related to these candidates. We are reimbursed by PRCL for intellectual property management costs in connection with the contributed intellectual property. If and when proof-of-concept is reached with either drug candidate, Eli Lilly and Company, which is an investor in TVM, will help manage the development program through one of its divisions and will have an option to acquire PRCL or its assets at the then fair value.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not yet generated any product revenue and may never do so. Our revenues to date have been generated primarily through our former collaboration and license agreements. The terms of these agreements included payment to us of upfront license fees, milestone payments, research and development cost sharing and royalties. We may seek to generate revenue from product sales and from future collaborative or strategic relationships. In the future, we expect any revenue we may generate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received and expenses incurred under future collaborations or strategic relationships, if consummated, and the amount and timing of payments we may receive upon the sale of our drug candidates, to the extent any are successfully commercialized.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense consists of costs incurred in connection with developing and advancing our drug discovery technology and identifying and developing our drug candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred.\nOur research and development expenses have consisted primarily of:\n\u2022 internal costs associated with research, preclinical and clinical activities;\n\u2022 payments to third party contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs;\n\u2022 costs associated with drug formulation and supply of drugs for clinical trials;\n\u2022 personnel related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and travel; and\n\u2022 overhead expenses, including rent and maintenance of our facilities, and laboratory and other supplies.\nWe do not know if we will be successful in developing any of our drug candidates. Because we may seek to out-license or sell our drug candidates to one or more parties, we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our drug candidates will be subject to future development or the timelines or capital requirements related to any such arrangement. Because of this uncertainty, the numerous risks and uncertainties related to drug development, clinical trials, regulatory requirements and product manufacturing, and the stage of development of our drug candidates, we are unable to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. The duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development, including with respect to:\n\u2022 the number of clinical sites included in the trial;\n\u2022 the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects;\n\u2022 the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials; and\n\u2022 the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials.\nOur expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals. In addition, we may obtain unexpected or unfavorable results from future clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others. A change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in any of our clinical trials, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control would evolve and therefore impact any potential future clinical development programs and plans over time.\nWe anticipate that overall research and development costs will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial for futility, restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, bonuses and related expenses for personnel in executive, finance, business and commercial development, investor and medical community relations, human resources and administrative functions. Other costs include stock-based compensation\ncosts, directors' and officers' liability insurance premiums, legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, fees for general legal, accounting, public-company requirements and compliance, and other professional services, as well as overhead-related costs not otherwise included in research and development.\nWe expect that general and administrative expense will increase in 2016 as compared to prior periods due to the re-allocation of facilities overhead costs that would otherwise be charged to research and development expense (until our facilities leases expire in the fourth quarter of 2016). This increase will be partially offset by lower personnel-related costs and stock compensation due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In connection with the restructuring in February 2016, we discontinued a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We are required to make estimates and judgments with respect to contract research accruals, the recoverability of long-lived assets and measurement of stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nCollaboration and License Agreements\nOur principal source of revenue to date has been our former collaboration and license agreements, which included upfront license payments, development milestones, reimbursement of research and development costs, potential profit sharing payments, commercial and sales-based milestones and royalties. The accounting for collaboration and license agreements requires subjective analysis and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about whether deliverables within multiple-element arrangements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual arrangement into separate units of accounting and to determine the arrangement consideration to be allocated to each unit of accounting.\nFor multiple-element arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011, we follow the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13-Multiple-deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU No. 2009-13). ASU No. 2009-13 amended certain provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605-Revenue Recognition. This standard addresses the determination of the unit(s) of accounting for multiple-element arrangements and how an arrangement's consideration should be allocated to each unit of accounting.\nPursuant to this standard, each required deliverable is evaluated to determine if it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting. For us this determination includes an assessment as to whether the deliverable has \"stand-alone value\" to the customer separate from the undelivered elements. The arrangement's consideration is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The estimated selling price of each deliverable is determined using the\nfollowing hierarchy of values: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, (ii) third-party evidence of selling price, or (iii) our best estimate of the selling price (BESP). The BESP reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis. We expect, in general, to use BESP for allocating consideration to each deliverable in future collaboration agreements. In general, the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is then recognized as the related goods or services are delivered limited to the consideration not contingent upon future deliverables. We did not recognize any revenue related to collaboration and license agreements during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nWe account for development milestones under collaboration and license agreements pursuant to ASU No. 2010-17 Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition (ASU No. 2010-17). ASU No. 2010-17 codified a method of revenue recognition that has been common practice. Under this method, contingent consideration from research and development activities that is earned upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment. We do not have any ongoing collaboration and license agreements under which milestones may be achieved.\nRoyalty revenues are based upon a percentage of net sales. Royalties from the sales of products will be recorded on the accrual basis when results are reliably measurable, collectability is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Commercial and sales-based milestones, which are based upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon sales thresholds, will be recognized in the period in which the respective sales threshold is achieved and collectability is reasonably assured. We do not have any ongoing collaboration and license agreements under which royalties or commercial and sales-based milestones may be achieved.\nAccrued Expenses and Accrued Contract Research Liabilities\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements. Given our current business, the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our operating results is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials. In connection with all of the foregoing service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided. The majority of our service providers, including contract research organizations, invoice us in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred, or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period, our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated. We currently reflect the effects of any changes in estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances directly in our operations in the period such change becomes known. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a net reduction in accrued contract\nresearch costs of approximately $2.9 million, principally as a result of the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial.\nOur arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed. We recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion. The date on which services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date, and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods. We recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations. Generally, these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial, monitoring the trial, closing the trial and preparing the resulting data. Costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial.\nWith respect to financial reporting periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers, the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs. In light of the foregoing, we do not believe our practices for estimating future expenses and making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future. Except for the change in estimate recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015, there were no changes in our estimates and accruals for contract service fees that had a material net effect on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees, officers and directors. We use the Black- Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value as it is the most appropriate valuation method for our option grants. The Black-Scholes model requires inputs for risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and expected lives of the options. Expected volatility is based upon the weighted average historical volatility data of our common stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected lives for options granted represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. We use the simplified method for determining the expected lives of options. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical data. This analysis is re-evaluated at least annually and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary.\nFor awards with graded vesting, we recognize compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the award on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nOur net loss included stock-based compensation costs in the amount of $4.3 million, $7.4 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and no income tax benefit related to our stock-based compensation arrangements for employee and non-employee awards. As of December 31, 2015, the total amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense was $7.0 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.8 years.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nRevenues\nThere were no revenues in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nResearch and Development Expense\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 / 2014\nComparison </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 / 2013\nComparison </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in millions)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ganetespib\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>43.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>56.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>64.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(13.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (24 </td> <td>)% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(7.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (12 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> STA-12-8666\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Elesclomol\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (60 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CRACM\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (67 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (67 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other early stage programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (61 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>54.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>68.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>71.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(14.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (21 </td> <td>)% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(3.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGanetespib\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our ganetespib program decreased by $13.5 million, including decreases of $3.4 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational and stock compensation resulting from a lower level of FTEs, and $10.1 million in external costs. Decreases in external costs principally resulted from lower costs incurred in 2015 in connection with the early termination of the GALAXY-2 trial in October 2015 for futility, and the close-outs of the GALAXY-1 trial, the ENCHANT-1 trial and other company-sponsored trials, as well as costs that were incurred in the first quarter of 2014 for validation manufacturing that were not incurred in 2015. These lower costs were partially offset by higher costs incurred in 2015 related to completion of enrollment in the I-SPY-2 trial that commenced in October 2014. We recorded a $2.9 million net reduction in accrued contract research costs during the fourth quarter of 2015, principally as a result of the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial. We anticipate that overall research and development costs in support of the ganetespib program will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial for futility, restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our ganetespib program decreased by $7.7 million, including decreases of $3.6 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $4.1 million in net decreases for external costs. Internal costs decreased principally due to available resources being allocated to our HDC program. External costs overall decreased due to lower costs incurred in 2014 related to the wind-down of the GALAXY-1 trial, the ENCHANT-1 trial and other company-sponsored trials, offset by the increase resulting from the advancement of the GALAXY-2 trial that commenced enrollment in April 2013 and the initiation of the I-SPY 2 breast cancer trial in October 2014. In addition, costs were incurred in 2013 for the conduct of NDA-supporting clinical pharmacology studies that were not incurred in 2014.\nSTA-12-8666\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our STA-12-8666 program increased by $6.5 million, including increases of $3.7 million for personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $2.8 million for external costs. In the first quarter of\n2015, we commenced pre-clinical development of our lead HDC candidate, STA-12-8666. Prior to commencing pre-clinical development in 2015, costs incurred under our STA-12-8666 program were reported under our early-stage programs. We anticipate that overall research and development costs in support of the STA-12-8666 program will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes and our decision not to pursue submitting an IND submission for STA-12-8666 in the immediate future.\nElesclomol\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our elesclomol program decreased by $0.3 million including decreases of $0.1 million for personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.2 million for external costs.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our elesclomol program increased by $0.4 million, principally due to increases of $0.1 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.3 million in external costs. These increases were principally related to the pace of the ongoing clinical trial in ovarian cancer.\nCRACM\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our CRACM program decreased by $0.2 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation. In May 2014, we entered into a license arrangement with PRCL under which we may conduct preclinical research activities in the future that would be reimbursed by PRCL.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our CRACM program decreased by $0.6 million, principally due to decreases of $0.4 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.2 million in external costs. These decreases were the result of a lower investment in the CRACM program as we sought a corporate partner. In May 2014, we entered into a license arrangement with PRCL under which we are not required to perform any research activities.\nEarly-stage programs\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our early stage programs decreased by $6.5 million, including decreases of $6.2 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.3 million in external costs. In 2015, we advanced our lead HDC candidate, STA-12-8666, into IND-enabling studies and began reporting these costs separately under the STA-12-8666 program. We anticipate that overall research and development costs in support of the HDC discovery program will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our early stage programs increased by $4.2 million, including increases of $4.1 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.1 million in external costs. These increases were principally the result of our investment in the HDC program that was announced in September 2013.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 / 2014\nComparison </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 / 2013\nComparison </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in millions)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(2.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (15 </td> <td>)% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2.3 million, including net decreases of $2.0 million in personnel-related costs, related overhead and stock compensation, and $0.3 million in external professional fees. The $2.0 million net decrease in internal costs was principally in connection with approximately $2.0 million in lower net compensation costs related to management changes in the position of President and Chief Executive Officer. In the first quarter of 2014, Safi Bahcall resigned and we recognized approximately $2.0 million in costs in connection with his separation agreement that were not incurred in 2015, including approximately $1.0 million in cash compensation being paid over two years and approximately $1.0 million in non-cash stock compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting and extended vesting period of certain of his stock options. We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in 2016 as compared to prior periods due to the re-allocation of facilities overhead costs that would otherwise be charged to research and development expense (until our facilities leases expire in the fourth quarter of 2016). This increase will be partially offset by lower personnel-related costs and stock compensation due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In connection with the restructuring in February 2016, we discontinued a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, general and administrative expenses remained at a constant level, including $1.1 million in net decreases in external professional fees principally related to lower patent prosecution costs, offset by an increase of $1.1 million in personnel-related costs, related overhead and stock compensation. The net increase in internal costs was principally related to management changes in the position of President and Chief Executive Officer. In March 2014, Safi Bahcall, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, resigned and we entered into a separation agreement with him. In the first quarter of 2014, we recognized approximately $2.0 million in costs in connection with this separation agreement, including approximately $1.0 million in cash compensation to be paid over two years and approximately $1.0 million in non-cash stock compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting and extended vesting period of certain of his stock options. In August 2014, we announced the hiring of Anne Whitaker, our new President and Chief Executive Officer and entered into an employment contract with her. In the third quarter of 2014, we recognized approximately $0.4 million in related upfront cash compensation for a sign-on bonus and relocation allowance. These increases were partially offset by executive compensation that was incurred in 2013 that was not incurred in 2014 while we conducted a search for a new President and Chief Executive Officer following Safi Bahcall's departure.\nInterest Expense, net\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 / 2014\nComparison </th> <th> </th> <th>2014/ 2013\nComparison </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2014 </th> <th> </th> <th>2013 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> <th>$ </th> <th> </th> <th>% </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(dollars in millions)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(1.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (50 </td> <td>)% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(0.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (15 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, interest expense decreased due to principal payments under the GECC Term Loan and the original three-year $2.0 million loan under the Oxford Term Loan.

The use of cash in these periods principally resulted from our losses from operations, as adjusted for non-cash charges for depreciation and stock-based compensation, and changes in our working capital accounts.\nIn 2015, our investing activities provided cash of $20.0 million, including the sales and maturities of marketable securities in our investment portfolio in the amount of $137.2 million, offset by the purchases of marketable securities in the amount of $117.1 million and purchases of property and equipment in the amount of $0.1 million.

We repaid $9.2 million,\n$9.5 million and $2.6 million in principal payments in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in connection with the GECC Term Loan and the Oxford Term Loan. In January 2014, we began making 30 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. During the period from July 2012 through March 2013, we made 9 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. For the periods from April 2013 through December 2013 we made interest-only payments.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following tables summarize our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions).\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Contractual Obligations (as of December 31, 2015)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017\nthrough\n2018 </th> <th> </th> <th>2019\nthrough\n2020 </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating and capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GECC and Oxford Term Loans(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development contracts(2)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes scheduled interest payments and an exit fee of $788,000 due at the time of the final payment of the outstanding principal under the GECC Term Loan.\n(2)Research and development contracts principally include contracts for human clinical studies, animal studies and clinical manufacturing.

Under the co-development agreement, this CRO was performing clinical research services under a reduced fee structure in exchange for a share of licensing payments and commercial revenues, if any, up to a specified maximum payment, which is defined as a multiple of the fee reduction realized. The maximum amount of the service fee discount was realized in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn accordance with the termination provisions of the Roche Agreement, all rights to the CRACM licensed compounds under the agreement were returned to us.

Sales of common stock through MLV were made pursuant to an \"at-the-market\" offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act). MLV used commercially reasonable efforts to sell the common stock based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions that we imposed). All shares were sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-187242). We paid MLV a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds. The May 2012 and May 2014 Sales Agreements were terminated by us upon the sale of substantially all stock authorized for sale under each such agreements.

No shares have been sold to-date under the October 2015 Sales Agreement.\nTerm Loans\nGeneral Electric Capital Corporation (GECC)\nIn March 2013, we amended our loan and security agreement entered into in September 2010 with GECC and one other lender, or the GECC Term Loan, and obtained $12.9 million in additional loan funding and, as a result, increased the principal balance to $22.5 million at March 31, 2013. Interest on the borrowings under the GECC Term Loan remains at the annual rate of 9.75%. We made interest-only payments for the period from April 2013 through December 2013. In January 2014, we began making 30 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. During the period from July 2012 through March 2013, we made 9 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. For the periods from April 2013 through December 2013 and prior to July 2012 we made interest-only payments. As of December 31, 2015, in accordance with the GECC Term Loan, $4.5 million in remaining principal payments is scheduled to be paid by June 2016, at which time we are obligated to pay an exit fee in the amount of $788,000. (See Note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOxford Finance Corporation (Oxford)\nIn March 2011, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Oxford and received $2.0 million in loan funding, and in December 2012, we entered into a loan modification agreement, as amended, under which we could elect to draw down up to an additional $0.6 million in equipment financing until June 30, 2013, which we collectively refer to herein as the Oxford Term Loan. As of June 30, 2013, the Company had fully utilized the $0.6 million in additional equipment financing. Interest on the borrowings under the Oxford Term Loan accrues at an annual rate of 13.35%. In May 2011, we began making 36 equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest on the initial $2.0 million outstanding balance that was fully paid in April 2014. We continue to make equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest on the $0.6 million in additional equipment financing. As of December 31, 2015, in accordance with the Oxford Term Loan, $107,000 in remaining principal payments is scheduled to be paid by July 2016. (See Note 9 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.)\nLiquidity\nFunding Requirements\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 the completion of the ongoing investigator-sponsored clinical trials of ganetespib;\n\u2022 the costs involved in conducting preclinical activities for our ganetespib and HDC programs;\n\u2022 the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022 the extent to which we may elect to continue drug development activities in the future, if at all; and\n\u2022 the timing and completion of any transaction that may result from our ongoing strategy review.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $66.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $31.1 million from $97.7 million as of December 31, 2014. This decrease principally reflects $49.6 million that we raised in net cash proceeds, including $41.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in a public offering and $7.7 million in net proceeds from sales of our common stock under the at-the-market issuance sales agreement with MLV, offset by cash used in operations and term loan principal payments as discussed under \"Cash Flows\" above.\nWe have not yet generated any product revenue and may never do so. We cannot predict whether and to what extent we may continue drug development activities, if at all, and what our future cash needs may be for any such activities. We expect our $66.6 million in cash resources as of December 31, 2015, along with significantly lower operating expenses following the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial, subsequent restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months. This estimate assumes no additional funding from new partnership agreements, equity financings or further sales under our ATM. The timing and nature of certain activities contemplated for the remainder of 2016 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources. We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-206135) under which we have up to $300 million in securities available for future issuance, including up to $100 million in shares of common stock that we have reserved and that may be offered and sold under the October 2015 Sales Agreement with Cowen. However, pursuant to the instructions to Form S-3, we only have the ability to sell shares under the shelf registration statement, during any 12-month period, in an amount less than or equal to one-third of the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates.\nWe may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials and conduct additional preclinical and discovery activities. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with future research and development activities.\nTo the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future operating and capital requirements, we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings or licensing arrangements. However, additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling convertible debt securities, further dilution to our existing stockholders may result. If we raise funds through collaboration agreements or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently. Conversely, we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.\nTax Loss Carryforwards\nFor tax years through 2015 we performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code that would limit our ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We determined that we experienced an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, in connection with our acquisition of Principia Associates, Inc. on September 20, 2002, but did not experience a change in ownership upon the effectiveness of our IPO, or any other equity offerings to date. As a result, the utilization of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change is limited. As of December 31, 2015, we have net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal tax purposes of approximately $578.1 million, after excluding net operating losses that have expired unused as a result of Section 382 limitations, with the remainder expiring in varying amounts through 2035 unless utilized. As of December 31, 2015, we have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $321.9 million, which will expire through 2035 unless utilized. The net operating loss carryforwards include approximately $1.4 million of deductions related to the exercise of common stock options. This amount represents an excess tax benefit and has not been included in the gross deferred tax asset reflected for net operating losses. The utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited if we experience future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCertain Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward- looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nSynta Pharmaceuticals Corp. is a company that has historically focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel oncology medicines that have the potential to change the lives of cancer patients. In October 2015, we announced the decision to terminate for futility the Phase 3 GALAXY-2 trial of our novel heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor, ganetespib, and docetaxel in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma. Based on a review of a pre-planned interim analysis, the study's Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) concluded that the addition of ganetespib to docetaxel was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of overall survival compared to docetaxel alone.\nWe have also been evaluating several candidates from our proprietary Hsp90 inhibitor Drug Conjugate program, or HDC program, which leverages the preferential accumulation of Hsp90 inhibitors in tumors to selectively deliver a wide array of anti-cancer payloads. We are currently conducting studies for our first clinical candidate from the HDC program, STA-12-8666, in anticipation of potentially submitting an investigational new drug application, or IND, for STA-12-8666. While we have determined not to pursue an IND submission for STA-12-8666 in the immediate future, we may determine to do so at a later date.\nWe were incorporated in March 2000 and commenced operations in July 2001. Since that time, we were principally engaged in the discovery and development of novel drug candidates. As of December 31, 2015, we have raised an aggregate of approximately $868.9 million in cash proceeds to fund operations, including $665.9 million in net proceeds from private and public offerings of our equity, $30.5 million in gross proceeds from term loans and $167.2 million in non-refundable payments from partnering activities under prior collaborations, as well as $5.3 million from the exercise of common stock warrants and options. We have also generated funds from government grants, equipment lease financings and investment income.\nWe have historically devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of our drug candidates, as well as intellectual property prosecution. We currently do not have any drugs that are commercially available and none of our drug candidates have obtained approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or any similar foreign regulatory authority. Since our inception, we have had no revenues from product sales. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $706.2 million.\nKey Developments\nFollowing the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial in October 2015, we initiated a comprehensive review of our strategy. In November 2015, we committed to a restructuring that consisted primarily of a workforce reduction to better align our workforce to our revised operating plans, which included support of key ongoing ganetespib investigator-sponsored studies and continued effort on development of candidates from the HDC program, in particular STA-12-8666. The restructuring was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. Cash payments in connection with the workforce reduction, comprised principally of severance, unused vacation payments, benefits continuation costs and outplacement services, were approximately $2.6 million of which approximately $1.3 million was paid during the fourth quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $1.3 million was\naccrued in remaining restructuring-related payments that are expected to be substantially paid during the first quarter of 2016.\nAs announced in March 2016, in order to conserve cash while we continue to evaluate business alternatives to maximize value for stockholders, we committed to an additional restructuring in February 2016 that consisted primarily of a workforce reduction of 23 positions, including 19 research and development positions, to a total of 10 remaining positions. In connection with this restructuring, we discontinued a substantial portion of our research and development activities. Cash payments in connection with the workforce reduction, comprised principally of severance, unused vacation payments, benefits continuation costs and outplacement services, will be approximately $1.5 million. We expect the restructuring to be substantially completed during the first quarter of 2016 and the majority of the related cash payments to be paid during the first half of 2016. Employees directly affected by the restructuring have received notification and will be provided with severance payments.\nWe continue to conduct limited activities with respect to ganetespib and the candidates in the HDC program, including STA-12-8666. With the exception of ongoing clinical trials in ovarian cancer and sarcoma, we have undertaken efforts to wind down existing ganetespib investigator-sponsored clinical trials. We have also entered into strategic agreements to out-license two of our prior drug candidates, elesclomol and our calcium release-activated calcium channel (CRACM) inhibitor program. However, we no longer anticipate expending material resources on any of our current drug candidates.\nAs previously announced in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 1, 2016, reporting the restructuring of our workforce, we have been considering potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. Such strategic alternatives include, but are not limited to, a sale of the company, a business combination or collaboration, joint development and partnership opportunities, a distribution of all or a significant amount of cash to stockholders, and liquidation of the company. We do not know if we will be successful in pursuing any strategic alternative or that any transaction will occur; however, we are committed to pursuing a strategic direction that our Board of Directors believes is in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe cannot predict whether and to what extent we may continue drug development activities, if at all, and what our future cash needs may be for any such activities. We expect our $66.6 million in cash resources as of December 31, 2015, along with significantly lower operating expenses following the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial, subsequent restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months.\nOn December 3, 2015, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued inclusion on The NASDAQ Global Market under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). The notification letter states that pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) the Company will be afforded 180 calendar days, or until May 31, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of the Company's common stock must maintain a minimum bid closing price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. If we do not regain compliance by May 31, 2016, we may transfer to The NASDAQ Capital Market in order to receive an additional 180-day compliance period to comply. In order to be eligible for the transfer and additional time, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all of the initial listing requirements for The NASDAQ Capital Market, other than the minimum bid price requirement, and must notify NASDAQ in writing of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. While we intend to engage in efforts to regain compliance, and thus maintain our listing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance during the applicable time periods set forth.\nOur Oncology Candidates\nWe have a clinical-stage drug candidate in oncology (ganetespib) and a novel, proprietary small molecule cancer drug development program (the HDC program).\nGanetespib (Hsp90 Inhibitor)\nGanetespib is a novel, potent, small molecule inhibitor of Hsp90, a molecular chaperone which is required for the proper folding and activation of many cancer-promoting proteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 by ganetespib leads to the simultaneous degradation of many of these client proteins and the subsequent death or cell cycle arrest of cancer cells dependent on those proteins. A number of Hsp90 client proteins are also involved in the resistance of cancer cells to other anti-cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy. The ability to reduce cancer-cell drug resistance suggests that the combination of ganetespib with chemotherapies or other anti-cancer agents may provide greater benefit than those agents administered alone. In preclinical studies, ganetespib has shown potent anti-cancer activity against a broad range of solid and hematologic cancers, both as a monotherapy and in combination with a variety of anti-cancer treatment approaches including chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.\nOngoing Ganetespib Clinical Trials\nWe expect to continue to support the clinical trials in ovarian cancer and sarcoma described below by providing ganetespib drug supply and required safety and regulatory oversight until each of these respective studies conclude.\nGANNET53 Trial-Ganetespib in ovarian cancer\nGANNET53, a Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) research project funded by the European Commission, is a pan-European randomized trial designed to evaluate the combination of ganetespib and paclitaxel vs. paclitaxel alone in over 200 patients with metastatic, predominantly p53 mutant, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Preclinical models have shown that mutant p53 is critical to the growth and proliferation of these cancers. Many mutations render p53 unable to fold appropriately, leaving the protein highly dependent on Hsp90 for stability. Inhibition of Hsp90 destroys the complex between Hsp90 and mutant p53, leading to the degradation of the protein and cancer cell death. We believe that mutated p53 may to serve as a predictive biomarker for Hsp90 inhibitors such as ganetespib.\nHsp90 inhibition has also been shown to sensitize mutant p53 cancer cells to treatment with chemotherapies, as has been seen in preclinical studies evaluating ganetespib in other tumor types, supporting the planned trial design evaluating the combination of ganetespib and paclitaxel vs. paclitaxel alone.\nEnrollment of the safety lead-in Phase 1 portion of GANNET53 in centers in Austria, Belgium, France, and Germany began in July 2014 and is now complete. Initial results from the Phase 1 portion presented in June 2015 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting demonstrated the feasibility and tolerability of combining ganetespib and paclitaxel in this treatment setting. In June 2015, we announced that the first patient was enrolled into the randomized Phase 2 portion of the trial.\nWe expect completion of enrollment in this trial to occur in 2017; however, as GANNET53 is an investigator-sponsored trial, we do not ultimately control the enrollment timeline for the study.\nSARC 023-Ganetespib in Sarcoma\nSARC 023, sponsored by the Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC), is an open label Phase 1/2 trial of ganetespib in combination with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus in patients with refractory sarcoma, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). The Pediatric Subcommittee of ODAC reviewed the design of SARC 023, as well as pre-clinical data demonstrating the scientific rationale for studying this combination in a clinical trial. The Phase 1 portion of the study, which is currently ongoing, is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated/recommended dose of the combination.\nWe expect completion of enrollment in this trial to occur in 2017; however, as SARC 023 is an investigator-sponsored trial, we do not ultimately control the enrollment timeline for the study.\nOther Ganetespib Clinical Trials\nIn light of recent corporate developments, we have elected to no longer support other investigator-sponsored clinical trials with the exception of ensuring drug supply of ganetespib to currently enrolled patients deemed to be receiving medical benefit and providing required safety and regulatory monitoring. Our expectation is that no additional patients will be enrolled on ganetespib containing treatment arms of clinical studies other than the ovarian cancer and sarcoma trials described above. Our intent is to wind down the ganetespib containing arms in all other remaining investigator-sponsored trials by mid-2016.\nIncluded in these studies are the AML-LI (Less Intensive)-1 and AML-18 trials evaluating ganetespib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and the I-SPY 2 TRIAL (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular Analysis 2) evaluating ganetespib in women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced breast cancer.\nHDC Program\nIn September 2013, we announced the launch of a novel, proprietary small molecule cancer drug development program: the HDC program.\nHDCs are drug candidates consisting of an Hsp90 inhibitor (targeting moiety) joined to an anti-cancer agent (payload) via a cleavable chemical linker optimized for controlled release of payload drug inside cancer cells. HDCs are small molecules that do not rely on cell surface antigens for targeting and internalization for cellular uptake. Upon cell entry, typically via small molecule uptake (passive diffusion and possibly active transporter), HDCs can bind intracellular Hsp90 that is present in significant amounts in a wide range of cancers.\nUpon systemic administration HDCs have the potential to achieve significantly higher concentrations of active anticancer drugs (payloads) in tumors than the concentrations achieved when such anticancer drugs are given in their original, unconjugated form. It is important to note that such high concentrations are sustained over prolonged periods of time, thus significantly increasing the exposure of tumors to the anticancer drug relative to the exposure that can be achieved when such anticancer drugs are given in their original, unconjugated form.\nIn October 2013, we announced the publication of the first key patent application covering our proprietary HDC technology, which includes composition of matter claims covering HDC compounds, methods for identifying therapeutically effective compounds, and methods of use against a wide range of diseases and conditions. Any resulting patent, if issued, would expire no earlier than 2034.\nOur lead drug candidate from our HDC Program is STA-12-8666, a conjugate of an Hsp90 inhibitor bound to SN-38, the highly potent active metabolite of the widely used chemotherapy irinotecan.\nAs part of our strategic overview and in light of recent corporate developments, however, we have decided not pursue an IND submission for STA-12-8666 at this time.\nOther Candidates\nElesclomol (Mitochondria-Targeting Agent)\nIn January 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to further develop our drug candidate, elesclomol. We will no longer be performing research activities on this drug candidate and, as part of the arrangement, we will receive a minority interest and Board representation in the third party, payments based on achievement of certain development milestones and product royalties upon commercialization.\nCRACM Ion Channel Inhibitors\nIn May 2014, we entered into a license arrangement for our CRACM program, including two lead candidates and the associated intellectual property portfolio, with PRCL Research Inc. (PRCL), a company funded by TVM Life Science Venture VII and the Fonds de Solidarit\u00e9 des Travailleurs du Qu\u00e9bec, based in Montreal, Canada. PRCL's plans were to develop one of the two lead candidates licensed from us to proof-of-concept. We have recently been informed that PRCL has selected one of these candidates to move forward into IND enabling studies.\nWe hold a minority interest in PRCL and a seat on PRCL's Board of Directors. We are not required to provide any research funding or capital contributions to PRCL, and we are not required to perform any research activities related to these candidates. We are reimbursed by PRCL for intellectual property management costs in connection with the contributed intellectual property. If and when proof-of-concept is reached with either drug candidate, Eli Lilly and Company, which is an investor in TVM, will help manage the development program through one of its divisions and will have an option to acquire PRCL or its assets at the then fair value.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have not yet generated any product revenue and may never do so. Our revenues to date have been generated primarily through our former collaboration and license agreements. The terms of these agreements included payment to us of upfront license fees, milestone payments, research and development cost sharing and royalties. We may seek to generate revenue from product sales and from future collaborative or strategic relationships. In the future, we expect any revenue we may generate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received and expenses incurred under future collaborations or strategic relationships, if consummated, and the amount and timing of payments we may receive upon the sale of our drug candidates, to the extent any are successfully commercialized.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense consists of costs incurred in connection with developing and advancing our drug discovery technology and identifying and developing our drug candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred.\nOur research and development expenses have consisted primarily of:\n\u2022 internal costs associated with research, preclinical and clinical activities;\n\u2022 payments to third party contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs;\n\u2022 costs associated with drug formulation and supply of drugs for clinical trials;\n\u2022 personnel related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and travel; and\n\u2022 overhead expenses, including rent and maintenance of our facilities, and laboratory and other supplies.\nWe do not know if we will be successful in developing any of our drug candidates. Because we may seek to out-license or sell our drug candidates to one or more parties, we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our drug candidates will be subject to future development or the timelines or capital requirements related to any such arrangement. Because of this uncertainty, the numerous risks and uncertainties related to drug development, clinical trials, regulatory requirements and product manufacturing, and the stage of development of our drug candidates, we are unable to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. The duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development, including with respect to:\n\u2022 the number of clinical sites included in the trial;\n\u2022 the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects;\n\u2022 the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials; and\n\u2022 the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials.\nOur expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals. In addition, we may obtain unexpected or unfavorable results from future clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others. A change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in any of our clinical trials, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control would evolve and therefore impact any potential future clinical development programs and plans over time.\nWe anticipate that overall research and development costs will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial for futility, restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, bonuses and related expenses for personnel in executive, finance, business and commercial development, investor and medical community relations, human resources and administrative functions. Other costs include stock-based compensation\ncosts, directors' and officers' liability insurance premiums, legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, fees for general legal, accounting, public-company requirements and compliance, and other professional services, as well as overhead-related costs not otherwise included in research and development.\nWe expect that general and administrative expense will increase in 2016 as compared to prior periods due to the re-allocation of facilities overhead costs that would otherwise be charged to research and development expense (until our facilities leases expire in the fourth quarter of 2016). This increase will be partially offset by lower personnel-related costs and stock compensation due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In connection with the restructuring in February 2016, we discontinued a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We are required to make estimates and judgments with respect to contract research accruals, the recoverability of long-lived assets and measurement of stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nCollaboration and License Agreements\nOur principal source of revenue to date has been our former collaboration and license agreements, which included upfront license payments, development milestones, reimbursement of research and development costs, potential profit sharing payments, commercial and sales-based milestones and royalties. The accounting for collaboration and license agreements requires subjective analysis and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about whether deliverables within multiple-element arrangements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual arrangement into separate units of accounting and to determine the arrangement consideration to be allocated to each unit of accounting.\nFor multiple-element arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011, we follow the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13-Multiple-deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU No. 2009-13). ASU No. 2009-13 amended certain provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605-Revenue Recognition. This standard addresses the determination of the unit(s) of accounting for multiple-element arrangements and how an arrangement's consideration should be allocated to each unit of accounting.\nPursuant to this standard, each required deliverable is evaluated to determine if it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting. For us this determination includes an assessment as to whether the deliverable has \"stand-alone value\" to the customer separate from the undelivered elements. The arrangement's consideration is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The estimated selling price of each deliverable is determined using the\nfollowing hierarchy of values: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, (ii) third-party evidence of selling price, or (iii) our best estimate of the selling price (BESP). The BESP reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis. We expect, in general, to use BESP for allocating consideration to each deliverable in future collaboration agreements. In general, the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is then recognized as the related goods or services are delivered limited to the consideration not contingent upon future deliverables. We did not recognize any revenue related to collaboration and license agreements during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nWe account for development milestones under collaboration and license agreements pursuant to ASU No. 2010-17 Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition (ASU No. 2010-17). ASU No. 2010-17 codified a method of revenue recognition that has been common practice. Under this method, contingent consideration from research and development activities that is earned upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment. We do not have any ongoing collaboration and license agreements under which milestones may be achieved.\nRoyalty revenues are based upon a percentage of net sales. Royalties from the sales of products will be recorded on the accrual basis when results are reliably measurable, collectability is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Commercial and sales-based milestones, which are based upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon sales thresholds, will be recognized in the period in which the respective sales threshold is achieved and collectability is reasonably assured. We do not have any ongoing collaboration and license agreements under which royalties or commercial and sales-based milestones may be achieved.\nAccrued Expenses and Accrued Contract Research Liabilities\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements. Given our current business, the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our operating results is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials. In connection with all of the foregoing service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided. The majority of our service providers, including contract research organizations, invoice us in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred, or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period, our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated. We currently reflect the effects of any changes in estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances directly in our operations in the period such change becomes known. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a net reduction in accrued contract\nresearch costs of approximately $2.9 million, principally as a result of the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial.\nOur arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed. We recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion. The date on which services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date, and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods. We recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations. Generally, these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial, monitoring the trial, closing the trial and preparing the resulting data. Costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial.\nWith respect to financial reporting periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers, the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs. In light of the foregoing, we do not believe our practices for estimating future expenses and making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future. Except for the change in estimate recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015, there were no changes in our estimates and accruals for contract service fees that had a material net effect on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees, officers and directors. We use the Black- Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value as it is the most appropriate valuation method for our option grants. The Black-Scholes model requires inputs for risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and expected lives of the options. Expected volatility is based upon the weighted average historical volatility data of our common stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected lives for options granted represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. We use the simplified method for determining the expected lives of options. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical data. This analysis is re-evaluated at least annually and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary.\nFor awards with graded vesting, we recognize compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the award on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nOur net loss included stock-based compensation costs in the amount of $4.3 million, $7.4 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and no income tax benefit related to our stock-based compensation arrangements for employee and non-employee awards. As of December 31, 2015, the total amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense was $7.0 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.8 years.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nRevenues\nThere were no revenues in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nResearch and Development Expense\n\nGanetespib\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our ganetespib program decreased by $13.5 million, including decreases of $3.4 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational and stock compensation resulting from a lower level of FTEs, and $10.1 million in external costs. Decreases in external costs principally resulted from lower costs incurred in 2015 in connection with the early termination of the GALAXY-2 trial in October 2015 for futility, and the close-outs of the GALAXY-1 trial, the ENCHANT-1 trial and other company-sponsored trials, as well as costs that were incurred in the first quarter of 2014 for validation manufacturing that were not incurred in 2015. These lower costs were partially offset by higher costs incurred in 2015 related to completion of enrollment in the I-SPY-2 trial that commenced in October 2014. We recorded a $2.9 million net reduction in accrued contract research costs during the fourth quarter of 2015, principally as a result of the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial. We anticipate that overall research and development costs in support of the ganetespib program will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial for futility, restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our ganetespib program decreased by $7.7 million, including decreases of $3.6 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $4.1 million in net decreases for external costs. Internal costs decreased principally due to available resources being allocated to our HDC program. External costs overall decreased due to lower costs incurred in 2014 related to the wind-down of the GALAXY-1 trial, the ENCHANT-1 trial and other company-sponsored trials, offset by the increase resulting from the advancement of the GALAXY-2 trial that commenced enrollment in April 2013 and the initiation of the I-SPY 2 breast cancer trial in October 2014. In addition, costs were incurred in 2013 for the conduct of NDA-supporting clinical pharmacology studies that were not incurred in 2014.\nSTA-12-8666\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our STA-12-8666 program increased by $6.5 million, including increases of $3.7 million for personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $2.8 million for external costs. In the first quarter of\n2015, we commenced pre-clinical development of our lead HDC candidate, STA-12-8666. Prior to commencing pre-clinical development in 2015, costs incurred under our STA-12-8666 program were reported under our early-stage programs. We anticipate that overall research and development costs in support of the STA-12-8666 program will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes and our decision not to pursue submitting an IND submission for STA-12-8666 in the immediate future.\nElesclomol\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our elesclomol program decreased by $0.3 million including decreases of $0.1 million for personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.2 million for external costs.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our elesclomol program increased by $0.4 million, principally due to increases of $0.1 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.3 million in external costs. These increases were principally related to the pace of the ongoing clinical trial in ovarian cancer.\nCRACM\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our CRACM program decreased by $0.2 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation. In May 2014, we entered into a license arrangement with PRCL under which we may conduct preclinical research activities in the future that would be reimbursed by PRCL.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our CRACM program decreased by $0.6 million, principally due to decreases of $0.4 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.2 million in external costs. These decreases were the result of a lower investment in the CRACM program as we sought a corporate partner. In May 2014, we entered into a license arrangement with PRCL under which we are not required to perform any research activities.\nEarly-stage programs\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, costs incurred under our early stage programs decreased by $6.5 million, including decreases of $6.2 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.3 million in external costs. In 2015, we advanced our lead HDC candidate, STA-12-8666, into IND-enabling studies and began reporting these costs separately under the STA-12-8666 program. We anticipate that overall research and development costs in support of the HDC discovery program will decrease significantly for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, costs incurred under our early stage programs increased by $4.2 million, including increases of $4.1 million in personnel-related costs, related research supplies, operational overhead and stock compensation, and $0.1 million in external costs. These increases were principally the result of our investment in the HDC program that was announced in September 2013.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2.3 million, including net decreases of $2.0 million in personnel-related costs, related overhead and stock compensation, and $0.3 million in external professional fees. The $2.0 million net decrease in internal costs was principally in connection with approximately $2.0 million in lower net compensation costs related to management changes in the position of President and Chief Executive Officer. In the first quarter of 2014, Safi Bahcall resigned and we recognized approximately $2.0 million in costs in connection with his separation agreement that were not incurred in 2015, including approximately $1.0 million in cash compensation being paid over two years and approximately $1.0 million in non-cash stock compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting and extended vesting period of certain of his stock options. We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in 2016 as compared to prior periods due to the re-allocation of facilities overhead costs that would otherwise be charged to research and development expense (until our facilities leases expire in the fourth quarter of 2016). This increase will be partially offset by lower personnel-related costs and stock compensation due to the restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. In connection with the restructuring in February 2016, we discontinued a substantial portion of our research and development activities for cash conservation purposes.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, general and administrative expenses remained at a constant level, including $1.1 million in net decreases in external professional fees principally related to lower patent prosecution costs, offset by an increase of $1.1 million in personnel-related costs, related overhead and stock compensation. The net increase in internal costs was principally related to management changes in the position of President and Chief Executive Officer. In March 2014, Safi Bahcall, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, resigned and we entered into a separation agreement with him. In the first quarter of 2014, we recognized approximately $2.0 million in costs in connection with this separation agreement, including approximately $1.0 million in cash compensation to be paid over two years and approximately $1.0 million in non-cash stock compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting and extended vesting period of certain of his stock options. In August 2014, we announced the hiring of Anne Whitaker, our new President and Chief Executive Officer and entered into an employment contract with her. In the third quarter of 2014, we recognized approximately $0.4 million in related upfront cash compensation for a sign-on bonus and relocation allowance. These increases were partially offset by executive compensation that was incurred in 2013 that was not incurred in 2014 while we conducted a search for a new President and Chief Executive Officer following Safi Bahcall's departure.\nInterest Expense, net\n\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, interest expense decreased due to principal payments under the GECC Term Loan and the original three-year $2.0 million loan under the Oxford Term Loan. Interest\nexpense will continue to decrease as a result of scheduled maturities of the GECC Term Loan and the Oxford Term Loan in June 2016 and July 2016, respectively.\nIn 2014 as compared to 2013, interest expense decreased due to the start of principal payments in January 2014 under the GECC Term Loan and the maturity in April 2014 of the original three-year $2.0 million loan under the Oxford Term Loan.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash position, cash flows and capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n\nOur operating activities used cash of $71.4 million, $78.9 million and $77.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The use of cash in these periods principally resulted from our losses from operations, as adjusted for non-cash charges for depreciation and stock-based compensation, and changes in our working capital accounts.\nIn 2015, our investing activities provided cash of $20.0 million, including the sales and maturities of marketable securities in our investment portfolio in the amount of $137.2 million, offset by the purchases of marketable securities in the amount of $117.1 million and purchases of property and equipment in the amount of $0.1 million. In 2014, our investing activities used cash of $8.8 million, including the purchases of marketable securities in the amount of $93.8 million and purchases of property and equipment in the amount of $0.1 million, offset by maturities of marketable securities in our investment portfolio in the amount of $85.1 million. In 2013, our investing activities used cash of $24.7 million, including the purchases of marketable securities of $114.2 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.8 million, offset by maturities of marketable securities in our investment portfolio in the amount of $90.3 million.\nOur financing activities provided cash of $40.4 million, $85.3 million and $69.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, we raised approximately $49.6 million in net cash proceeds, including $41.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of 25,300,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering in April 2015 and $7.7 million in net proceeds from sales of 3,614,511 shares of our common stock under the at-the-market issuance sales agreements with MLV. In 2014, we raised approximately $94.8 million in net cash proceeds, including $89.0 million in net proceeds from sales of 21,692,753 shares of our common stock under at-the-market issuance sales agreements with MLV, $5.0 million in a registered direct offering of 1,250,000 shares of our common stock to an affiliate of a director who is our largest stockholder and $0.8 million from the exercise of common stock options. In 2013, we raised approximately $71.7 million in net cash proceeds, including $57.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of 16,100,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering in November 2013, $13.5 million in gross proceeds from additional funding under the GECC Term Loan and Oxford Term Loan and $1.1 million from the exercise of common stock options. We repaid $9.2 million,\n$9.5 million and $2.6 million in principal payments in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in connection with the GECC Term Loan and the Oxford Term Loan. In January 2014, we began making 30 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. During the period from July 2012 through March 2013, we made 9 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. For the periods from April 2013 through December 2013 we made interest-only payments.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following tables summarize our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions).\n\n(1)Includes scheduled interest payments and an exit fee of $788,000 due at the time of the final payment of the outstanding principal under the GECC Term Loan.\n(2)Research and development contracts principally include contracts for human clinical studies, animal studies and clinical manufacturing. In the event a study or manufacturing contract is terminated prior to the planned completion by mutual agreement between the contractor and us, the amount paid under such contracts may be less than the amounts presented.\n(3)Includes certain contract amendments entered into after December 31, 2015.\nAmounts not included in the table of Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nIn July 2011, we entered into a co-development agreement with one of our clinical research organizations, or CRO, for the conduct of certain company-sponsored clinical trials. Under the co-development agreement, this CRO was performing clinical research services under a reduced fee structure in exchange for a share of licensing payments and commercial revenues, if any, up to a specified maximum payment, which is defined as a multiple of the fee reduction realized. The maximum amount of the service fee discount was realized in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn accordance with the termination provisions of the Roche Agreement, all rights to the CRACM licensed compounds under the agreement were returned to us. In May 2014, we entered into a license arrangement with PRCL Research, Inc for two lead candidates and the associated intellectual property portfolio. We may pay Roche a low single-digit royalty on any potential future sales of the licensed products.\nIn accordance with the termination provisions of the GSK Agreement, all rights to the elesclomol program were returned to us. In January 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party to further develop our drug candidate, elesclomol. We may pay GSK a low single-digit royalty on any potential future sales of elesclomol.\nUnder a license agreement, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $0.5 million if specified development milestones are met, as follows (in millions).\n\nPublic and Registered Direct Offerings\nIn April 2015, we raised approximately $44.3 million in gross proceeds from the sale of an aggregate 25,300,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $1.75 per share, including 3,300,000 shares upon the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. Certain of our directors and their affiliates, including our largest stockholder, purchased an aggregate of 7,257,142 shares in this offering at the public offering price. The net offering proceeds to us were approximately $41.9 million after deducting underwriters' discounts, fees and commissions, and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn April 2014, we sold 1,250,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $4.01 per share in a registered direct offering to an affiliate of a director who is our largest stockholder. These shares were sold directly without a placement agent, underwriter, broker or dealer. The net proceeds to us were approximately $5.0 million after deducting offering expenses payable by the Company.\nIn November 2013, we raised approximately $60.4 million in gross proceeds from the sale of an aggregate 16,100,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $3.75 per share, including 14,000,000 shares in the initial offering and 2,100,000 shares upon the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. Certain of our directors and their affiliates, including our largest stockholder, purchased an aggregate of 5,183,333 shares in this offering. The net offering proceeds to us were approximately $57.1 million after deducting underwriters' discounts, fees and commissions, and other offering expenses payable by us.\nAt-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreements\nMLV & Co., LLC\nWe entered into at-the-market issuance sales agreements (May 2012, May 2014 and July 2014 Sales Agreements) with MLV & Co., LLC (MLV), pursuant to which we issued and sold shares of our common stock from time to time, at our option, through MLV as our sales agent. Sales of common stock through MLV were made pursuant to an \"at-the-market\" offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act). MLV used commercially reasonable efforts to sell the common stock based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions that we imposed). All shares were sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-187242). We paid MLV a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds. The May 2012 and May 2014 Sales Agreements were terminated by us upon the sale of substantially all stock authorized for sale under each such agreements. In October 2015, we terminated the July 2014 Sales Agreement.\nIn March and April 2014, we sold an aggregate of 6,588,875 shares of common stock pursuant to the May 2012 Sales Agreement for an aggregate of approximately $28.0 million in gross proceeds at an average selling price of $4.25 per share. Net proceeds to us were approximately $27.3 million after deducting commissions and other transactions costs.\nFrom May 2014 through July 2014, we sold an aggregate of 9,424,193 shares of common stock pursuant to the May 2014 Sales Agreement for an aggregate of approximately $40.0 million in gross proceeds at an average selling price of $4.24 per share. Net proceeds to us were approximately $39.2 million after deducting commissions and other transactions costs, including approximately $33.6 million from the sale of 8,060,244 shares in the second quarter of 2014 and approximately $5.6 million from the sale of 1,363,949 shares in July 2014.\nIn July 2014, we reserved up to $50 million under our shelf registration statement for issuance under the July 2014 Sales Agreement. In the third quarter of 2014, we sold an aggregate of 5,679,685 shares of common stock pursuant to the July 2014 Sales Agreement for an aggregate of approximately $23.0 million in gross proceeds at an average selling price of $4.05 per share. Net proceeds to us were approximately $22.5 million after deducting commissions and other transaction costs.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, we sold an aggregate of 3,614,511 shares of common stock pursuant to the July 2014 Sales Agreement for an aggregate of approximately $7.9 million in gross proceeds at an average selling price of $2.19 per share. Net proceeds to us were approximately $7.7 million after deducting commissions and other transaction costs.\nCowen and Company, LLC\nIn October 2015, we entered into an at-the-market issuance sales agreement (October 2015 Sales Agreement), with Cowen and Company, LLC (Cowen), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million, from time to time, at our option, through Cowen as our sales agent. Sales of common stock through Cowen may be made by any method that is deemed an \"at-the-market\" offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including by means of ordinary brokers' transactions at market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by us and Cowen. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Cowen will use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell the common stock based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). We are not obligated to make any sales of our common stock under the Sales Agreement. Any shares sold will be sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (file no. 333-206135). We will pay Cowen a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds. The October 2015 Sales Agreement may be terminated by us at any time upon 10 days' notice. No shares have been sold to-date under the October 2015 Sales Agreement.\nTerm Loans\nGeneral Electric Capital Corporation (GECC)\nIn March 2013, we amended our loan and security agreement entered into in September 2010 with GECC and one other lender, or the GECC Term Loan, and obtained $12.9 million in additional loan funding and, as a result, increased the principal balance to $22.5 million at March 31, 2013. Interest on the borrowings under the GECC Term Loan remains at the annual rate of 9.75%. We made interest-only payments for the period from April 2013 through December 2013. In January 2014, we began making 30 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. During the period from July 2012 through March 2013, we made 9 equal monthly payments of principal under the GECC Term Loan. For the periods from April 2013 through December 2013 and prior to July 2012 we made interest-only payments. As of December 31, 2015, in accordance with the GECC Term Loan, $4.5 million in remaining principal payments is scheduled to be paid by June 2016, at which time we are obligated to pay an exit fee in the amount of $788,000. (See Note 9 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOxford Finance Corporation (Oxford)\nIn March 2011, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Oxford and received $2.0 million in loan funding, and in December 2012, we entered into a loan modification agreement, as amended, under which we could elect to draw down up to an additional $0.6 million in equipment financing until June 30, 2013, which we collectively refer to herein as the Oxford Term Loan. As of June 30, 2013, the Company had fully utilized the $0.6 million in additional equipment financing. Interest on the borrowings under the Oxford Term Loan accrues at an annual rate of 13.35%. In May 2011, we began making 36 equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest on the initial $2.0 million outstanding balance that was fully paid in April 2014. We continue to make equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest on the $0.6 million in additional equipment financing. As of December 31, 2015, in accordance with the Oxford Term Loan, $107,000 in remaining principal payments is scheduled to be paid by July 2016. (See Note 9 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.)\nLiquidity\nFunding Requirements\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 the completion of the ongoing investigator-sponsored clinical trials of ganetespib;\n\u2022 the costs involved in conducting preclinical activities for our ganetespib and HDC programs;\n\u2022 the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022 the extent to which we may elect to continue drug development activities in the future, if at all; and\n\u2022 the timing and completion of any transaction that may result from our ongoing strategy review.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $66.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $31.1 million from $97.7 million as of December 31, 2014. This decrease principally reflects $49.6 million that we raised in net cash proceeds, including $41.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in a public offering and $7.7 million in net proceeds from sales of our common stock under the at-the-market issuance sales agreement with MLV, offset by cash used in operations and term loan principal payments as discussed under \"Cash Flows\" above.\nWe have not yet generated any product revenue and may never do so. We cannot predict whether and to what extent we may continue drug development activities, if at all, and what our future cash needs may be for any such activities. We expect our $66.6 million in cash resources as of December 31, 2015, along with significantly lower operating expenses following the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial, subsequent restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months. This estimate assumes no additional funding from new partnership agreements, equity financings or further sales under our ATM. The timing and nature of certain activities contemplated for the remainder of 2016 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources. We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-206135) under which we have up to $300 million in securities available for future issuance, including up to $100 million in shares of common stock that we have reserved and that may be offered and sold under the October 2015 Sales Agreement with Cowen. However, pursuant to the instructions to Form S-3, we only have the ability to sell shares under the shelf registration statement, during any 12-month period, in an amount less than or equal to one-third of the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates.\nWe may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials and conduct additional preclinical and discovery activities. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with future research and development activities.\nTo the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future operating and capital requirements, we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings or licensing arrangements. However, additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling convertible debt securities, further dilution to our existing stockholders may result. If we raise funds through collaboration agreements or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently. Conversely, we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.\nTax Loss Carryforwards\nFor tax years through 2015 we performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code that would limit our ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We determined that we experienced an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, in connection with our acquisition of Principia Associates, Inc. on September 20, 2002, but did not experience a change in ownership upon the effectiveness of our IPO, or any other equity offerings to date. As a result, the utilization of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change is limited. As of December 31, 2015, we have net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal tax purposes of approximately $578.1 million, after excluding net operating losses that have expired unused as a result of Section 382 limitations, with the remainder expiring in varying amounts through 2035 unless utilized. As of December 31, 2015, we have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $321.9 million, which will expire through 2035 unless utilized. The net operating loss carryforwards include approximately $1.4 million of deductions related to the exercise of common stock options. This amount represents an excess tax benefit and has not been included in the gross deferred tax asset reflected for net operating losses. The utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited if we experience future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCertain Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward- looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions.

oncology medicines, experienced significant developments affecting its financial and operational stance as of December 31, 2015. Key events include:\n\n- The Phase 3 GALAXY-2 trial for the novel heat shock protein 90 inhibitor, ganetespib, was terminated in October 2015, as it was unlikely to show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for patients with advanced non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma.\n- Funding raised since inception was approximately $868.9 million, with no FDA approvals for drug candidates and no product sales revenue. The accumulated deficit was $706.2 million.\n- A major restructuring took place, including workforce reduction and reevaluation of the company's strategy, mainly focusing on key ganetespib studies and the HDC program.\n- Cash payments in connection with workforce reduction were around $2.6 million.\n- Restructuring in early 2016 led to further reduction of the workforce and a majority of research and development activities.\n- Ganetespib trials continued in ovarian cancer and sarcoma, while wind-down of other clinical studies was planned.\n- Out-licensing agreements were secured for two drug candidates with payment based on development milestones and sales.\n- Strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value are under consideration, including a potential company sale, collaboration, joint development, or liquidation.\n- Cash resources as of the end of 2015 were $66.6 million, with a prediction it would fund operations for at least twelve months further.\n\nThe company faced a NASDAQ non-compliance notice due to its stock bid price falling below $1.00, with a compliance deadline of May 31, 2016. If non-compliance persists, the company could transfer to The NASDAQ Capital Market for an additional compliance period.\n\nThe company's oncology focus includes the ganetespib Hsp90 inhibitor and the HDC program, which aims to deliver potent anti-cancer payloads selectively to tumors using Hsp90 inhibitors. Initial HDC program development centered on STA-12-8666, which has been put aside for future consideration.\n\nFinancially, Synta experienced a decrease in general and administrative expenses, partially owing to management changes and a decrease in research and development expenses after discontinuing several trials. They expect general and administrative expenses to increase due to overhead reallocations but will be partially offset by cost reductions from restructurings. Interest expenses have also decreased with continued repayments of term loans.\n\nIn terms of funding, Synta conducted public offerings and utilized at-the-market issuances to raise capital. They hold sales agreements with MLV & Co. LLC and Cowen and Company, LLC alongside term loan agreements with General Electric Capital Corporation and Oxford Finance Corporation to support their financial needs.\n\nThe report also outlines contractual obligations, including operating and capital lease obligations, term loans, and research and development contracts totaling approximately $15.8 million.\n\nSynta has not yet determined how or if it will continue its drug development activities and what its future funding needs will be. Addition of new equity, debt, or partnerships may be pursued depending on future strategic decisions, but there are no guarantees of successful additional funding."}
