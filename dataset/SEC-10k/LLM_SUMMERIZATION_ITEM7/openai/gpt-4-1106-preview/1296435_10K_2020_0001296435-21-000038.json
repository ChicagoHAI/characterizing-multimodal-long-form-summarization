Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020. Also discussed is our financial position as of the end of this year. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. A detailed discussion of year ended December 31, 2019 can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2020.\nIntroduction\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the historical performance of our business, its financial condition and its prospects. We will discuss and provide our analysis of the following:\n\u2022Overview of Business;\n\u2022Business Segments;\n\u2022Results of Operations and Related Information;\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources;\n\u2022Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements; and\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates.\nOverview of Business\nWe are a leading global producer of specialty materials for niche markets. We have two primary operations: our technical products business and our fine paper and packaging business.\nOur mission is to create critical components that create possibilities for our customers and end-users. We expect to create value by growing in markets where product performance or image is valued and where we have competitive advantages. In managing our businesses, we believe that achieving and maintaining a leadership position in our markets, responding effectively to customer needs and competitive challenges, employing capital optimally, controlling costs and managing risks are important to long-term success. Changes in general economic conditions and timing of changes in input costs and selling prices can also impact our results. In this discussion and analysis, we will refer to these factors.\nBusiness Segments\nOur reportable operating segments consist of Technical Products and Fine Paper and Packaging.\nOur technical products business is a leading international producer of transportation, water and other filter media and durable, saturated and coated substrates for a variety of end markets. We focus on categories where we believe we are, or can be, a market leader. These categories include filtration media for transportation, water and other end use applications, backings for specialty tapes and abrasives, performance labels, digital transfer papers, and other custom engineered materials. Our products are typically used in high performance applications where our customers require specific standards and qualifications. Our dedicated technical products manufacturing facilities are located in Weidach and Bruckm\u00fchl, Germany, Eerbeek, Netherlands, Bolton, England, Munising, Michigan, Appleton, Wisconsin, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts.\nOur fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium printing, packaging, and other high-end specialty papers predominantly in North America. Our products include some of the most recognized and preferred brands in North America, where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories. Often these papers are characterized by distinctive finishing, colors, textures and coating. We sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors, as well as through converters, major national retailers and specialty businesses. Our dedicated fine paper and packaging\nmanufacturing facilities are located in Whiting and Neenah, Wisconsin, and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. In addition, certain products of both segments are manufactured in shared facilities located in Brownville and Lowville, New York, and Quakertown, Pennsylvania.\nResults of Operations and Related Information\nIn this section, we discuss and analyze our net sales, income before interest and income taxes (which we refer to as \"operating income\") and other information relevant to an understanding of our results of operations.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nIn 2020, we faced adverse impacts of the outbreak of COVID-19 which resulted in the decline in global economic activity and significantly reduced demand for our products and our customers' products. While we experienced varying degrees of recovery in our markets, the pandemic had a material negative impact on our business operations and financial results, including net sales and earnings. Both of our business segments have continued to operate during the pandemic as essential suppliers of goods and services and we continue to take steps to ensure the safety of our employees, including frequent cleaning and disinfection of workspaces, property and equipment, instituting social distancing measures and providing remote working environments for administrative employees. We experienced a limited number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in our operations and quarantined those individuals and first level exposed employees in accordance with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the \"CDC\") guidelines. Such cases did not cause any significant disruption to operations, nor have we experienced material disruptions to our supply chain.\nManagement implemented a number of actions to preserve the safety of our employees (as discussed in Human Capital section of Item 1. \"Business\"), carefully control and reduce spending, and preserve liquidity by actively managing working capital. These actions included the following:\n\u2022reducing discretionary spending;\n\u2022minimizing capital expenditures and discretionary contributions to pension plans;\n\u2022suspending stock repurchases under our 2020 Stock Purchase Plan;\n\u2022utilizing government initiatives and subsidies such as deferring payroll taxes under the CARES Act, government employee retention subsidies in the U.S., Europe and the U.K., and net operating loss carrybacks;\n\u2022consolidating our manufacturing footprint; and\n\u2022reducing payroll costs through a freeze on wage increases and hiring, furloughs for all U.S. employees, and reductions in our salaried and hourly headcount.\nExecutive Summary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, consolidated net sales of $792.6 million decreased $145.9 million, or 16 percent, from $938.5 million in 2019. The decline in revenues resulted primarily from significant adverse volume impacts from COVID-19. Net sales declined 6% in Technical Products and 29% in Fine Paper and Packaging. In addition, net selling prices were modestly lower in 2020 due both to selling price and mix. The decline in net sales was more pronounced in the Fine Paper and Packaging segment due to reductions in end-use demand for commercial print papers used in advertising and marketing. While down versus prior year, third and fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net sales increased 18% and 8%, respectively, from each of the preceding quarters, as the global markets continued to recover.\nConsolidated operating income decreased $84.4 million from the prior year to a loss of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding adjusting items noted below, operating income decreased $18.7 million due primarily to lower sales and manufacturing cost inefficiencies related to COVID-19. The impact of lower volumes was only partly offset by spending reductions and lower input costs net of selling price reductions. As presented on the reconciliation table on page 35, we recorded $70.5 million of adjusting items in 2020 including non-cash asset restructuring and impairment costs for long-lived assets, other restructuring and non-routine costs, incremental costs of responding to COVID-19, loss on debt extinguishment, pension and SERP settlements and acquisition due diligence costs. Adjusting items of $4.8 million in 2019 included accelerated depreciation due to idling of a fine paper machine, restructuring and other non-routine costs and pension related gain.\nCash provided by operating activities of $93.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4.2 million lower than cash provided by operating activities of $97.6 million in the prior year. Actions to improve working capital and to reduce spending largely offset the impact from lower earnings.\nCapital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $18.9 million compared to $21.4 million in the prior year. Lower capital spending in 2020 of $2.5 million was due to actions to minimize capital spending.\nAnalysis of Net Sales - Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table presents net sales by segment and net sales expressed as a percentage of total net sales:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technical Products </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>508.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>541.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fine Paper and Packaging </td> <td> </td> <td>283.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>396.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>792.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>938.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommentary:\nYear 2020 versus 2019\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change in Net Sales Compared to the\nPrior Year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year\nEnded\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change Due To </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nChange </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Price </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Volume </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Currency </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technical Products </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>508.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>541.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(32.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fine Paper and Packaging </td> <td> </td> <td>283.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>396.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(113.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(102.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>792.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>938.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(145.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(115.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $145.9 million (16%) lower than the prior year. The decline in revenues resulted primarily from significant adverse volume impacts from COVID-19. Net sales declined 6% in Technical Products and 29% in Fine Paper and Packaging. In addition, net selling prices were modestly lower in 2020 due both to selling price and mix.

While down versus prior year, third and fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net sales increased 18% and 8%, respectively, from each of the preceding quarters, as the global markets continued to recover.\n\u2022Net sales in our technical products business decreased $32.7 million (6%) from the prior year. The revenue decrease resulted primarily from lower net selling prices partly as a result of declines in input costs as well as a lower value mix of products sold, and lower volumes reflecting adverse impacts of COVID-19. These factors were only partly offset by increased sales of filtration products, including media for face masks in Europe launched in 2020.\n\u2022Net sales in our fine paper and packaging business decreased $113.2 million (29%) from the prior year. The decline was primarily due to lower volumes, reflecting adverse impacts of COVID-19. Volume declines were more pronounced in commercial print as compared to premium packaging and consumer channel sales. Net selling prices were lower partly as a result of declines in input costs as well as a lower value mix of products sold.\nAnalysis of Operating Income - Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe

In addition, in 2020, it included $57.1 million, $7.8 million, and $5.6 million of unfavorable adjustments in Technical Products, Fine Paper and Packaging, and Unallocated corporate costs, respectively. In 2019, it included non-routine costs of $6.2 million primarily related to the accelerated depreciation and other costs related to the consolidation of the fine paper manufacturing footprint with the idling of a paper machine, and $1.4 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to the curtailment gain for the Neenah Coldenhove pension plan. See the breakdown by segment and the reconciliation table on page 35 for further detail.\nConsolidated operating income decreased $84.4 million from prior year to a loss of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding adjusting items noted below, operating income decreased $18.7 million due primarily to lower sales and manufacturing cost inefficiencies related to COVID-19. The impact of lower volumes was only partly offset by spending reductions and lower input costs net of selling price reductions. As presented on the reconciliation table on page 35, we recorded $70.5 million of adjusting items in 2020 including non-cash asset restructuring and impairment costs for long-lived assets, other restructuring and non-routine costs, incremental costs of responding to COVID-19, loss on debt extinguishment, pension and SERP settlements and acquisition due diligence costs. Adjusting items of $4.8 million in 2019 included accelerated depreciation due to idling of a fine paper machine, restructuring and other non-routine costs and pension related gain.\n\u2022Operating income for our technical products business decreased $49.4 million from prior year to a loss of 4.8 million. Excluding unfavorable adjusting items discussed above and shown on the reconciliation table on page 35, adjusted operating income increased $8.9 million (21%), primarily as a result of lower input costs net of selling price reductions, a more profitable mix of filtration products (including media for face masks) and reductions in SG&A and other spending. These were partly offset by lower sales and production volumes and related manufacturing cost inefficiencies.\n\u2022Operating income for our fine paper and packaging business decreased $29.9 million (56%) from the prior year period. Excluding unfavorable adjusting items discussed above and shown on the reconciliation table on page 35, adjusted operating income decreased $27.8 million (47%) from the prior year primarily as a result of lower sales and production volumes and related manufacturing cost inefficiencies. The impact of lower volumes was only partly offset by spending reductions and lower input costs net of selling price reductions.\n\u2022Unallocated corporate costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $24.6 million, or $5.1 million higher than the prior year. Excluding unfavorable adjusting items discussed above and shown on the reconciliation table on page 35, the unallocated corporate costs decreased $0.2 million from prior year.\nTable 17:

income includes the pre-tax effects of asset restructuring and impairment costs, other restructuring and non-routine costs, COVID-19 costs, loss on debt extinguishment, pension and SERP adjustments, and acquisition due diligence costs. We believe that by adjusting reported operating income to exclude the effects of such items, the resulting adjusted operating income is on a basis that reflects the results of our ongoing operations. In assessing COVID-19 impacts, we excluded only costs which were unusual, incremental and directly attributable to mitigating the effects COVID-19 on our operations. We believe that providing adjusted operating results will help investors gain an additional perspective of underlying business trends and results. Adjusted operating income is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for operating income derived in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may use different methodologies for calculating their non-GAAP financial measures and, accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to their measures.\nAdditional Statement of Operations Commentary:\n\u2022SG&A expense of $88.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10.6 million lower than 2019. Costs in 2020 were lower due to actions taken to reduce costs in areas including marketing, travel, and payroll-related spending, including impacts of furloughs, headcount reductions and wage and hiring freezes. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 11.2 percent remained comparable to 10.5 percent in 2019 despite lower sales.\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred $12.6 million and $11.8 million of interest expense, respectively. In addition to higher debt in the second half of 2020, 2020 interest expense included an incremental $0.4 million due to an overlap in interest incurred in July on both our Senior Notes and Term Loan B, prior to the redemption of the 2021 Senior Notes on July 16, 2020.\n\u2022Income tax expense (benefit) represented (16) percent and 17 percent of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In general, our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to impacts of changes in the mix of earnings in taxing jurisdictions with differing statutory rates, the impact of R&D and other tax credits, changes in tax laws and changes in corporate structure as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, our effective income tax (benefit) rate related to continuing operations of (16) percent was significantly impacted by the effects of the pre-tax loss in the U.S. resulting from the $52.3 million asset impairment loss of the U.S. transportation filtration asset (see Note 12, \"Asset Restructuring and Impairment Costs\" of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2020. Also, as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 and other factors, we evaluated our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, including research and development and other tax credits and NOLs, before they expire. During 2020, the effective income tax (benefit) rate was negatively impacted by a $4.6 million increase to the valuation allowance against our state tax credits and NOLs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our effective income tax rate related to continuing operations was 17 percent, primarily due to the tax benefit of R&D tax credits generated during the year.\n\u2022On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\"). The CARES Act included various income and payroll tax provisions designed to stimulate the economy and provide relief to businesses. Among its benefits was the ability to enhance the value of NOLs by allowing the carryback of NOLs to tax years in which the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate was 35%. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $0.9 million and a corresponding tax receivable of $8.0 million for this tax refund to be received during 2021. In addition, we generated cash tax savings from the option to delay payment of $4.4 million of 2020 U.S. payroll taxes until December 31, 2021 and 2022. We also utilized the payroll tax provisions of the Employee Retention Credit of the CARES Act to partially offset qualified wages and benefits of employees impacted by COVID-19 travel and other work restrictions. We utilized similar COVID-19 relief measures in Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. aimed at providing subsidies for employee retention and deferral of tax payments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that we have a strong financial position and the liquidity to withstand economic uncertainty during this volatile period, in consideration of the following:\n\u2022$37.1 million of cash and cash equivalents was on hand at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022we had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2020 under our Global Revolving Credit Facility; with a significant remaining availability of $138.6 million;\n\u2022we have no near-term debt maturities, as the Global Revolving Credit Facility matures in December 2023 and the Term Loan B facility matures in June 2027;\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flow provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(47.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(75.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flow Commentary\n\u2022Cash provided by operating activities of $93.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4.2 million lower than cash provided by operating activities of $97.6 million in the prior year. Actions to improve working capital and to reduce spending largely offset the impact from lower earnings.\nInvesting Cash Flow Commentary:\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash used by investing activities was $19.5 million and $23.3 million, respectively. Capital spending was reduced in 2020 by $2.5 million to preserve liquidity.\n\u2022Going forward, we expect aggregate annual capital expenditures to return to a range of approximately 2 to 4 percent of net sales. We believe that this level of capital spending can be funded from cash provided from operating activities and allows us to maintain the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our assets while also investing in expanded capabilities to successfully pursue strategic initiatives and deliver attractive returns.\nFinancing Cash Flow Commentary:\nOur liquidity requirements are provided by cash generated from operations and short- and long-term borrowings.\n\u2022On July 16, 2020, we completed the redemption in full of the $175 million of 2021 Senior Notes using the $200 million of proceeds from the Term Loan B which we entered into on June 30, 2020.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used by financing activities was $47.0 million compared to cash used by financing activities of $75.2 million for the prior year. The change was due to lower net debt repayments of $4.3 million in 2020 compared to $38.1 million in the prior year.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents increased $28.1 million to $37.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $9.0 million at December 31, 2019. Total debt decreased $6.4 million to $194.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $200.8 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in total debt reflects repayment of all\namounts outstanding under the Global Revolving Credit Facility and scheduled repayments of the Term Loan B and other debt (described below), which exceeded the net incremental borrowing from the Term Loan B (compared to the extinguished 2021 Senior Notes). Net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) decreased by $34.5 million.\n\u2022We have the following credit facilities:\nGlobal Revolving Credit Facility\nOn June 30, 2020, we amended our principal credit agreement (Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) to among other things, (a) remove the applicable components of the Term Loan B Priority Collateral (as defined in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statement included herein) from the borrowing base calculation under the Global Revolving Credit Facility, (b) permit the pledging of the Collateral under the Term B Facility and subordinate liens of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement lenders on Term Loan B Priority Collateral to the first position liens on Term Loan B Priority Collateral under the Term B Facility, (c) reduce the U.S. revolving credit facility amount from $150 million to $125 million, (d) reduce the German revolving credit facility amount from $75 million to $50 million, and (e) adjust certain reporting and financial covenant activation and deactivation thresholds. The variable interest rates on our revolving credit facility are based on LIBOR as a benchmark, exposing us to possible changes in interest in the event that the method for determining LIBOR changes, LIBOR is replaced by an alternative reference rate or LIBOR is phased out altogether. The impact related to any changes cannot be predicted at this time. As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Global Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt.\"\nTerm Loan B Facility\nOn July 16, 2020, we completed the redemption in full of the $175 million of 2021 Senior Notes using the $200 million of proceeds from the Term Loan B which we entered into on June 30, 2020. Under the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, and subject to certain conditions and adjustments, the Company may from time to time solicit the Term Loan B Lenders or new lenders to provide incremental term loan financings under the Term B Facility up to $125 million in the aggregate (each an \"Incremental Term Facility\"). Under the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, borrowings under the Term B Facility will bear interest, as selected by the Company, at a per annum rate equal to either (a) the reserve-adjusted LIBOR rate for interest periods of one, two or three months, plus an applicable rate of 4.00% per annum, or (b) the Alternate Base Rate, plus an applicable rate of 2.00% per annum. Alternate Base Rate\u201d will be equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate as quoted from time to time in The Wall Street Journal or published by the Federal Reserve Board, (2) the overnight bank funding rate established by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 50 basis points, and (3) one-month reserve-adjusted LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Alternate Base Rate is subject to a floor\u201d of 2.0%, and the adjusted LIBOR rate is subject to a floor\u201d of 1.0%. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding Term Loan borrowings was 5.0% per annum. The Term Loan B is repayable in equal quarterly installments commencing on September 30, 2020 in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the Term B Facility (subject to certain reductions in connection with debt prepayments and debt buybacks). The entire unpaid principal balance of the Term Loan B, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will be due and payable at maturity on June 30, 2027. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt.\"\nOther Debt\nIn January 2013, Neenah Germany entered into a project financing agreement for the construction of a melt blown machine (the \"Second German Loan Agreement\"). The Second German Loan Agreement provides for \u20ac9.0 million of construction financing which is secured by the melt blown machine. The loan matures in September 2022 and principal is repaid in equal quarterly installments. At December 31, 2020, \u20ac2.0 million ($2.4 million, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2020) was outstanding under the Second German Loan Agreement.\nIn May 2018, Neenah Germany entered into a project financing agreement for construction of a regenerative thermal oxidizer (the \"Third German Loan Agreement\") to increase the capacity of the existing saturators and ensure compliance with new European air emission standards. The agreement provides for \u20ac5.0 million of financing and is secured by the asset. The loan matures in September 2022 and principal is repaid in 13 equal quarterly installments beginning in June 2019. The interest rate on amounts outstanding is 1.45 percent based on actual days elapsed in a 360-day year and is payable quarterly. In the fourth quarter 2018, we received a subsidy from the German government of $0.9 million due to completion of the regenerative thermal oxidizer project. At December 31, 2020, \u20ac2.1 million ($2.6 million, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2020) was outstanding under the Third German Loan Agreement.\n\u2022Availability under our Global Revolving Credit Facility varies over time depending on the value of our inventory, receivables and (in the case of the German Revolving Credit Facility) various capital assets. As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings, and $0.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, outstanding under our Global Revolving Credit Facility and $138.6 million of available credit (based on exchange rates at December 31, 2020).\n\u2022We have required debt payments through December 31, 2021 of $4.9 million on the Term Loan B and the Second and Third German Loan Agreements\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, our cash balance of $37.1 million consists of $16.6 million in the U.S. and $20.5 million held at entities outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, there were no restrictions regarding the repatriation of our non-U.S. cash.\nTransactions with Shareholders\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.47 per common share or $31.9 million and $0.45 per common share or $30.5 million, respectively.\n\u2022In November 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a program for the purchase of up to $25 million of outstanding common stock effective January 1, 2021 (\"Stock Purchase Plan\"). The program does not require the Company to purchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Purchases under the Stock Purchase Plan will be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with the requirements of applicable law. The timing and amount of any purchases will depend on share price, market conditions and other factors. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired approximately 59,577 shares of Common Stock at a cost of $3.6 million. For further details on our Stock Purchase Plans refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Stockholders' Equity.\"\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we acquired approximately 22,064 and 17,774 shares of Common Stock, respectively, at a cost of $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for shares surrendered by employees to pay taxes due on vested restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights exercised.\n\u2022Under the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are permitted to pay cash dividends on, and repurchase shares of, our common stock without limitation, as long as our specified excess availability under the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement exceeds the greater of (i) $20 million and (ii) 12.5% of our aggregate commitments under the Global Revolving Credit Facility (approximately $22 million as of December 31, 2020), on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such dividend or stock repurchase (as the case may be). If our specified excess availability, on a pro forma basis, is less than the applicable threshold, we are subject to certain restrictions on the amount of cash dividends we are permitted to declare and the amount of share repurchases we are permitted to execute. As of December 31, 2020, our availability was $138.6 million, so this restriction did not apply. See our availability under the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt.\"\n\u2022Under the most restrictive terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, we are permitted to pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed $8.75 million per fiscal quarter. However, as long as the total leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the Term Loan Credit Agreement does not exceed 2.5 to 1.0, we can pay dividends or repurchase shares without limitation. In the event the total leverage ratio exceeds 2.5 to 1.0, but is less than or equal to 3.5 to 1.0, we may still pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount in excess of $8.75 million per fiscal quarter by utilizing certain \"restricted payment baskets\" described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. In addition, we would be permitted to pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock in excess of $8.75 million per fiscal quarter if the aggregate amount of such payments, together with the amount of redemptions or prepayments of certain indebtedness, is less than or equal to the greater of (i) $65 million and (ii) 9% of our consolidated tangible assets. As of December 31, 2020, since our total leverage ratio was less than 2.5 to 1.0, none of these covenants were restrictive to our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Beyond\n2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt payments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt (a) </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open purchase orders (b) </td> <td> </td> <td>83.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other post-employment benefits (c) </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contributions to pension trusts and other benefit obligations (d) </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum purchase commitments (e) </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (f) </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>421.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________\n(a)Interest payments on long-term debt includes interest on variable rate debt at December 31, 2020 weighted average interest rates.\n(b)The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts we anticipate will become payable within the next 12 months for goods and services that we have negotiated for delivery.\n(c)The above table includes future payments that we will make for postretirement benefits other than pensions. Those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations.\n(d)We expect to make aggregate contributions to qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension trusts and to pay pension benefits for unfunded pension of $5.8 million in 2021. The amount also includes estimated payments of $0.1 million per year over 20 years for the withdrawal liability from PIUMPF. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits.\"\n(e)The minimum purchase commitments in 2020 are primarily for utilities and information technology contracts. Although we are primarily liable for payments on the above minimum purchase commitments, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe our exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.\n(f)We adopted the ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) accounting standard in 2019 by recognizing the present value of the lease payments above as right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Leases.\"\nOther Items\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, we had $28.2 million of U.S. federal and $7.4 million of U.S. state R&D Credits which, if not used, will expire between 2028 and 2040 for the U.S. federal R&D Credits and between 2021 and 2035 for the state R&D Credits. As of December 31, 2020, we had $71.8 million of state net operating losses (NOLs) which may be used to offset state taxable income. The NOLs are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a deferred income tax asset of $4.4 million. If not used, substantially all of the NOLs will expire in various amounts between 2021 and 2040.\n\u2022Management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our borrowing capacity are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending and other cash needs for the next 12 months. Our ability to generate adequate cash from operations beyond 2020 will depend on, among other things, our ability to successfully implement our business strategies, control costs in line with market conditions and manage the impact of changes in input prices and currencies. We can give no assurance we will be able to successfully implement these items.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for a description of accounting standards adopted in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. The critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regard to estimates used. These critical judgments relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of expenses.\nThe following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of our financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nInventories\nWe value U.S. inventories at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method, or market. German and Dutch inventories are valued at the lower of cost, using a weighted-average cost method, or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") value of U.S. inventories valued on the LIFO method was $88.5 million and $102.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively and exceeded such LIFO value by $6.4 million and $8.9 million, respectively. Cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these materials and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. Since we value most of our inventory utilizing the LIFO inventory costing methodology, rapid changes in raw material costs have an immediate impact on our operating results.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Our effective income tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items, such as R&D Credits, foreign tax rate differences, tax effects of foreign financing structures, changes in statutory tax rates and excess tax benefits from stock compensation. While we believe that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our liability for uncertain income taxes positions was $8.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires considerable judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions occur, and a resulting income tax liability is recorded when management concludes that an income tax position fails to achieve a more likely than not recognition threshold. When this occurs, the amount of tax benefits recognized may differ from the amount taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. These differences represent unrecognized tax benefits and\nare reviewed at each reporting period based on facts, circumstances, available evidence and applicable laws. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $5.3 million and $5.2 million of foreign tax credits, all of which the Company believes will expire unutilized. Therefore, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded a valuation allowance which was equal to the balance of the deferred income tax asset. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company also had a valuation allowance of $6.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, against the gross value of its state tax credits and NOLs. Including the federal benefit of state taxes, the net valuation allowance reflected on the consolidated balance sheets was $5.1 million and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers many factors, including specific taxing jurisdictions, sources of taxable income, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nConsolidated pension expense related to continuing operations for defined benefit pension plans was $4.0 million, $3.7 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 7, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\" for components of net periodic benefit cost. Accounting for defined benefit pension plans requires various assumptions, including, but not limited to, discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, future compensation growth rates and mortality rates. Accounting for our postretirement benefit plans also requires various assumptions, which include, but are not limited to, discount rates and annual rates of increase in the per capita costs of health care benefits.\nThe following chart summarizes the more significant assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit plans for each of the past three years:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension plans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average discount rate for benefit expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.78 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average discount rate for benefit obligation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.94 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate on plan assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5.42 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.91 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.78 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase for benefit expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.05 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.44 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postretirement benefit plans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average discount rate for benefit expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.68 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average discount rate for benefit obligation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.68 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.84 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.80 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultimate cost trend rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year that the ultimate cost trend rate is reached\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2037 </td> <td> </td> <td>2037 </td> <td> </td> <td>2037 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in the U.S. is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of AA-rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place, whose duration matches the timing of expected pension benefit payments. The discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in Germany is generally based on the IBOXX index of AA-rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected pension benefit payments.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets held by our pension trusts was determined based on several factors, including input from pension investment consultants and projected long-term returns of broad equity and bond indices. We also considered the plans' historical 10-year and 15-year compounded annual returns. We evaluate our investment strategy and long-term rate of return on pension asset assumptions at least annually.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, consolidated postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit expense was $2.9 million, $3.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit obligations in the U.S. is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of AA-rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place, whose duration matches the timing of expected postretirement health care and life insurance benefit payments. The discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future postretirement health\ncare and life insurance obligations for our foreign benefit plans is generally based on an index of AA-rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected benefit payments.\nWe evaluate these assumptions at least once each year or as facts and circumstances dictate and we make changes as conditions warrant. Changes to these assumptions will increase or decrease our reported net periodic benefit expense, which will result in changes to the recorded benefit plan assets and liabilities.\nUseful Life and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nFor financial reporting purposes, depreciation is principally computed on the straight-line method over estimated useful asset lives. The weighted average remaining useful lives for buildings, land improvements and machinery and equipment are approximately 17 years, 20 years and 9 years respectively. We also use units-of-production method of depreciation for the U.S. transportation filtration production assets with a gross book value of $29.4 million, which reflects the nature of the assets' utilization.\nProperty, plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (\"ASC Topic 360\"), whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long-lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pre-tax cash flows. Impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines, future sales volumes, growth rates for selling prices and costs, alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets. An asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pre-tax cash flows from the use of the asset (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount. We estimate fair value based on an expected present value technique using multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate.\nThe estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the adverse impacts of COVID-19, the Company recorded asset restructuring and impairment costs of $55.3 million, of which $52.3 million related to a non-cash impairment loss for long-lived assets used primarily in the Technical Products segment. The other charge of $3.0 million arose from accelerated depreciation due to the idling of assets and related employee termination benefits for a workforce reduction in the Fine Paper and Packaging segment. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Restructuring and Impairment Costs\" for further discussion.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives\nWe test goodwill for impairment at least annually in conjunction with preparation of Neenah's annual business plan, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired.\nWe tested goodwill for impairment as of November 30, 2020 under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. In this quantitative assessment, the Company estimated the fair value of the reporting units using a market approach in combination with a discounted operating cash flow approach. Significant assumptions used in developing the discounted operating cash flow approach were revenue growth rates and pricing, costs for manufacturing inputs, levels of capital investment and estimated cost of capital for high, medium and low growth environments. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not. As of November 30, 2020, no impairment was indicated.\nOther Intangible Assets\nCertain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not amortized. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are annually reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350.\nAcquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360. Intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, trade names and acquired intellectual property. Such intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of between 10 and 15 years.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment loss for its indefinite-lived intangible assets (brand names) of $0.9 million and $0.4 million in the Fine Paper and Packaging and Technical Products segments, respectively, due to the adverse impacts of the pandemic. See Note 12, \"Asset Restructuring and Impairment Costs.\" Our annual test of other intangible assets for impairment at November 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 indicated that the carrying amount of such assets was recoverable.\nAcquisition Accounting\nWe account for acquisitions under ASC Topic 805, which requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. The accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimates, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. The assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models. Projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for our business. The impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020. Also discussed is our financial position as of the end of this year. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. A detailed discussion of year ended December 31, 2019 can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2020.\nIntroduction\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the historical performance of our business, its financial condition and its prospects. We will discuss and provide our analysis of the following:\n\u2022Overview of Business;\n\u2022Business Segments;\n\u2022Results of Operations and Related Information;\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources;\n\u2022Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements; and\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates.\nOverview of Business\nWe are a leading global producer of specialty materials for niche markets. We have two primary operations: our technical products business and our fine paper and packaging business.\nOur mission is to create critical components that create possibilities for our customers and end-users. We expect to create value by growing in markets where product performance or image is valued and where we have competitive advantages. In managing our businesses, we believe that achieving and maintaining a leadership position in our markets, responding effectively to customer needs and competitive challenges, employing capital optimally, controlling costs and managing risks are important to long-term success. Changes in general economic conditions and timing of changes in input costs and selling prices can also impact our results. In this discussion and analysis, we will refer to these factors.\nBusiness Segments\nOur reportable operating segments consist of Technical Products and Fine Paper and Packaging.\nOur technical products business is a leading international producer of transportation, water and other filter media and durable, saturated and coated substrates for a variety of end markets. We focus on categories where we believe we are, or can be, a market leader. These categories include filtration media for transportation, water and other end use applications, backings for specialty tapes and abrasives, performance labels, digital transfer papers, and other custom engineered materials. Our products are typically used in high performance applications where our customers require specific standards and qualifications. Our dedicated technical products manufacturing facilities are located in Weidach and Bruckm\u00fchl, Germany, Eerbeek, Netherlands, Bolton, England, Munising, Michigan, Appleton, Wisconsin, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts.\nOur fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium printing, packaging, and other high-end specialty papers predominantly in North America. Our products include some of the most recognized and preferred brands in North America, where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories. Often these papers are characterized by distinctive finishing, colors, textures and coating. We sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors, as well as through converters, major national retailers and specialty businesses. Our dedicated fine paper and packaging\nmanufacturing facilities are located in Whiting and Neenah, Wisconsin, and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. In addition, certain products of both segments are manufactured in shared facilities located in Brownville and Lowville, New York, and Quakertown, Pennsylvania.\nResults of Operations and Related Information\nIn this section, we discuss and analyze our net sales, income before interest and income taxes (which we refer to as \"operating income\") and other information relevant to an understanding of our results of operations.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nIn 2020, we faced adverse impacts of the outbreak of COVID-19 which resulted in the decline in global economic activity and significantly reduced demand for our products and our customers' products. While we experienced varying degrees of recovery in our markets, the pandemic had a material negative impact on our business operations and financial results, including net sales and earnings. Both of our business segments have continued to operate during the pandemic as essential suppliers of goods and services and we continue to take steps to ensure the safety of our employees, including frequent cleaning and disinfection of workspaces, property and equipment, instituting social distancing measures and providing remote working environments for administrative employees. We experienced a limited number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in our operations and quarantined those individuals and first level exposed employees in accordance with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the \"CDC\") guidelines. Such cases did not cause any significant disruption to operations, nor have we experienced material disruptions to our supply chain.\nManagement implemented a number of actions to preserve the safety of our employees (as discussed in Human Capital section of Item 1. \"Business\"), carefully control and reduce spending, and preserve liquidity by actively managing working capital. These actions included the following:\n\u2022reducing discretionary spending;\n\u2022minimizing capital expenditures and discretionary contributions to pension plans;\n\u2022suspending stock repurchases under our 2020 Stock Purchase Plan;\n\u2022utilizing government initiatives and subsidies such as deferring payroll taxes under the CARES Act, government employee retention subsidies in the U.S., Europe and the U.K., and net operating loss carrybacks;\n\u2022consolidating our manufacturing footprint; and\n\u2022reducing payroll costs through a freeze on wage increases and hiring, furloughs for all U.S. employees, and reductions in our salaried and hourly headcount.\nExecutive Summary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, consolidated net sales of $792.6 million decreased $145.9 million, or 16 percent, from $938.5 million in 2019. The decline in revenues resulted primarily from significant adverse volume impacts from COVID-19. Net sales declined 6% in Technical Products and 29% in Fine Paper and Packaging. In addition, net selling prices were modestly lower in 2020 due both to selling price and mix. The decline in net sales was more pronounced in the Fine Paper and Packaging segment due to reductions in end-use demand for commercial print papers used in advertising and marketing. While down versus prior year, third and fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net sales increased 18% and 8%, respectively, from each of the preceding quarters, as the global markets continued to recover.\nConsolidated operating income decreased $84.4 million from the prior year to a loss of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding adjusting items noted below, operating income decreased $18.7 million due primarily to lower sales and manufacturing cost inefficiencies related to COVID-19. The impact of lower volumes was only partly offset by spending reductions and lower input costs net of selling price reductions. As presented on the reconciliation table on page 35, we recorded $70.5 million of adjusting items in 2020 including non-cash asset restructuring and impairment costs for long-lived assets, other restructuring and non-routine costs, incremental costs of responding to COVID-19, loss on debt extinguishment, pension and SERP settlements and acquisition due diligence costs. Adjusting items of $4.8 million in 2019 included accelerated depreciation due to idling of a fine paper machine, restructuring and other non-routine costs and pension related gain.\nCash provided by operating activities of $93.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4.2 million lower than cash provided by operating activities of $97.6 million in the prior year. Actions to improve working capital and to reduce spending largely offset the impact from lower earnings.\nCapital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $18.9 million compared to $21.4 million in the prior year. Lower capital spending in 2020 of $2.5 million was due to actions to minimize capital spending.\nAnalysis of Net Sales - Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table presents net sales by segment and net sales expressed as a percentage of total net sales:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technical Products </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>508.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>541.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fine Paper and Packaging </td> <td> </td> <td>283.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>396.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>792.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>938.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommentary:\nYear 2020 versus 2019\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change in Net Sales Compared to the\nPrior Year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year\nEnded\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change Due To </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nChange </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Price </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Volume </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Currency </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technical Products </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>508.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>541.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(32.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fine Paper and Packaging </td> <td> </td> <td>283.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>396.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(113.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(102.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>792.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>938.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(145.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(115.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $145.9 million (16%) lower than the prior year. The decline in revenues resulted primarily from significant adverse volume impacts from COVID-19. Net sales declined 6% in Technical Products and 29% in Fine Paper and Packaging. In addition, net selling prices were modestly lower in 2020 due both to selling price and mix. The decline in net sales was more pronounced in the Fine Paper and Packaging segment due to reductions in end-use demand for commercial print papers used in advertising and marketing. While down versus prior year, third and fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net sales increased 18% and 8%, respectively, from each of the preceding quarters, as the global markets continued to recover.\n\u2022Net sales in our technical products business decreased $32.7 million (6%) from the prior year. The revenue decrease resulted primarily from lower net selling prices partly as a result of declines in input costs as well as a lower value mix of products sold, and lower volumes reflecting adverse impacts of COVID-19. These factors were only partly offset by increased sales of filtration products, including media for face masks in Europe launched in 2020.\n\u2022Net sales in our fine paper and packaging business decreased $113.2 million (29%) from the prior year. The decline was primarily due to lower volumes, reflecting adverse impacts of COVID-19. Volume declines were more pronounced in commercial print as compared to premium packaging and consumer channel sales. Net selling prices were lower partly as a result of declines in input costs as well as a lower value mix of products sold.\nAnalysis of Operating Income - Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe

In addition, in 2020, it included $57.1 million, $7.8 million, and $5.6 million of unfavorable adjustments in Technical Products, Fine Paper and Packaging, and Unallocated corporate costs, respectively. In 2019, it included non-routine costs of $6.2 million primarily related to the accelerated depreciation and other costs related to the consolidation of the fine paper manufacturing footprint with the idling of a paper machine, and $1.4 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to the curtailment gain for the Neenah Coldenhove pension plan. See the breakdown by segment and the reconciliation table on page 35 for further detail.\nConsolidated operating income decreased $84.4 million from prior year to a loss of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding adjusting items noted below, operating income decreased $18.7 million due primarily to lower sales and manufacturing cost inefficiencies related to COVID-19. The impact of lower volumes was only partly offset by spending reductions and lower input costs net of selling price reductions. As presented on the reconciliation table on page 35, we recorded $70.5 million of adjusting items in 2020 including non-cash asset restructuring and impairment costs for long-lived assets, other restructuring and non-routine costs, incremental costs of responding to COVID-19, loss on debt extinguishment, pension and SERP settlements and acquisition due diligence costs. Adjusting items of $4.8 million in 2019 included accelerated depreciation due to idling of a fine paper machine, restructuring and other non-routine costs and pension related gain.\n\u2022Operating income for our technical products business decreased $49.4 million from prior year to a loss of 4.8 million. Excluding unfavorable adjusting items discussed above and shown on the reconciliation table on page 35, adjusted operating income increased $8.9 million (21%), primarily as a result of lower input costs net of selling price reductions, a more profitable mix of filtration products (including media for face masks) and reductions in SG&A and other spending. These were partly offset by lower sales and production volumes and related manufacturing cost inefficiencies.\n\u2022Operating income for our fine paper and packaging business decreased $29.9 million (56%) from the prior year period. Excluding unfavorable adjusting items discussed above and shown on the reconciliation table on page 35, adjusted operating income decreased $27.8 million (47%) from the prior year primarily as a result of lower sales and production volumes and related manufacturing cost inefficiencies. The impact of lower volumes was only partly offset by spending reductions and lower input costs net of selling price reductions.\n\u2022Unallocated corporate costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $24.6 million, or $5.1 million higher than the prior year. Excluding unfavorable adjusting items discussed above and shown on the reconciliation table on page 35, the unallocated corporate costs decreased $0.2 million from prior year.\n \nThe following table

income includes the pre-tax effects of asset restructuring and impairment costs, other restructuring and non-routine costs, COVID-19 costs, loss on debt extinguishment, pension and SERP adjustments, and acquisition due diligence costs. We believe that by adjusting reported operating income to exclude the effects of such items, the resulting adjusted operating income is on a basis that reflects the results of our ongoing operations. In assessing COVID-19 impacts, we excluded only costs which were unusual, incremental and directly attributable to mitigating the effects COVID-19 on our operations. We believe that providing adjusted operating results will help investors gain an additional perspective of underlying business trends and results. Adjusted operating income is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for operating income derived in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may use different methodologies for calculating their non-GAAP financial measures and, accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to their measures.\nAdditional Statement of Operations Commentary:\n\u2022SG&A expense of $88.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10.6 million lower than 2019. Costs in 2020 were lower due to actions taken to reduce costs in areas including marketing, travel, and payroll-related spending, including impacts of furloughs, headcount reductions and wage and hiring freezes. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 11.2 percent remained comparable to 10.5 percent in 2019 despite lower sales.\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred $12.6 million and $11.8 million of interest expense, respectively. In addition to higher debt in the second half of 2020, 2020 interest expense included an incremental $0.4 million due to an overlap in interest incurred in July on both our Senior Notes and Term Loan B, prior to the redemption of the 2021 Senior Notes on July 16, 2020.\n\u2022Income tax expense (benefit) represented (16) percent and 17 percent of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In general, our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to impacts of changes in the mix of earnings in taxing jurisdictions with differing statutory rates, the impact of R&D and other tax credits, changes in tax laws and changes in corporate structure as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, our effective income tax (benefit) rate related to continuing operations of (16) percent was significantly impacted by the effects of the pre-tax loss in the U.S. resulting from the $52.3 million asset impairment loss of the U.S. transportation filtration asset (see Note 12, \"Asset Restructuring and Impairment Costs\" of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2020. Also, as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 and other factors, we evaluated our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, including research and development and other tax credits and NOLs, before they expire. During 2020, the effective income tax (benefit) rate was negatively impacted by a $4.6 million increase to the valuation allowance against our state tax credits and NOLs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our effective income tax rate related to continuing operations was 17 percent, primarily due to the tax benefit of R&D tax credits generated during the year.\n\u2022On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\"). The CARES Act included various income and payroll tax provisions designed to stimulate the economy and provide relief to businesses. Among its benefits was the ability to enhance the value of NOLs by allowing the carryback of NOLs to tax years in which the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate was 35%. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $0.9 million and a corresponding tax receivable of $8.0 million for this tax refund to be received during 2021. In addition, we generated cash tax savings from the option to delay payment of $4.4 million of 2020 U.S. payroll taxes until December 31, 2021 and 2022. We also utilized the payroll tax provisions of the Employee Retention Credit of the CARES Act to partially offset qualified wages and benefits of employees impacted by COVID-19 travel and other work restrictions. We utilized similar COVID-19 relief measures in Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. aimed at providing subsidies for employee retention and deferral of tax payments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that we have a strong financial position and the liquidity to withstand economic uncertainty during this volatile period, in consideration of the following:\n\u2022$37.1 million of cash and cash equivalents was on hand at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022we had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2020 under our Global Revolving Credit Facility; with a significant remaining availability of $138.6 million;\n\u2022we have no near-term debt maturities, as the Global Revolving Credit Facility matures in December 2023 and the Term Loan B facility matures in June 2027;\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flow provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(47.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(75.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flow Commentary\n\u2022Cash provided by operating activities of $93.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4.2 million lower than cash provided by operating activities of $97.6 million in the prior year. Actions to improve working capital and to reduce spending largely offset the impact from lower earnings.\nInvesting Cash Flow Commentary:\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash used by investing activities was $19.5 million and $23.3 million, respectively. Capital spending was reduced in 2020 by $2.5 million to preserve liquidity.\n\u2022Going forward, we expect aggregate annual capital expenditures to return to a range of approximately 2 to 4 percent of net sales. We believe that this level of capital spending can be funded from cash provided from operating activities and allows us to maintain the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our assets while also investing in expanded capabilities to successfully pursue strategic initiatives and deliver attractive returns.\nFinancing Cash Flow Commentary:\nOur liquidity requirements are provided by cash generated from operations and short- and long-term borrowings.\n\u2022On July 16, 2020, we completed the redemption in full of the $175 million of 2021 Senior Notes using the $200 million of proceeds from the Term Loan B which we entered into on June 30, 2020.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used by financing activities was $47.0 million compared to cash used by financing activities of $75.2 million for the prior year. The change was due to lower net debt repayments of $4.3 million in 2020 compared to $38.1 million in the prior year.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents increased $28.1 million to $37.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $9.0 million at December 31, 2019. Total debt decreased $6.4 million to $194.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $200.8 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in total debt reflects repayment of all\namounts outstanding under the Global Revolving Credit Facility and scheduled repayments of the Term Loan B and other debt (described below), which exceeded the net incremental borrowing from the Term Loan B (compared to the extinguished 2021 Senior Notes). Net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) decreased by $34.5 million.\n\u2022We have the following credit facilities:\nGlobal Revolving Credit Facility\nOn June 30, 2020, we amended our principal credit agreement (Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) to among other things, (a) remove the applicable components of the Term Loan B Priority Collateral (as defined in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statement included herein) from the borrowing base calculation under the Global Revolving Credit Facility, (b) permit the pledging of the Collateral under the Term B Facility and subordinate liens of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement lenders on Term Loan B Priority Collateral to the first position liens on Term Loan B Priority Collateral under the Term B Facility, (c) reduce the U.S. revolving credit facility amount from $150 million to $125 million, (d) reduce the German revolving credit facility amount from $75 million to $50 million, and (e) adjust certain reporting and financial covenant activation and deactivation thresholds. The variable interest rates on our revolving credit facility are based on LIBOR as a benchmark, exposing us to possible changes in interest in the event that the method for determining LIBOR changes, LIBOR is replaced by an alternative reference rate or LIBOR is phased out altogether. The impact related to any changes cannot be predicted at this time. As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Global Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt.\"\nTerm Loan B Facility\nOn July 16, 2020, we completed the redemption in full of the $175 million of 2021 Senior Notes using the $200 million of proceeds from the Term Loan B which we entered into on June 30, 2020. Under the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, and subject to certain conditions and adjustments, the Company may from time to time solicit the Term Loan B Lenders or new lenders to provide incremental term loan financings under the Term B Facility up to $125 million in the aggregate (each an \"Incremental Term Facility\"). Under the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, borrowings under the Term B Facility will bear interest, as selected by the Company, at a per annum rate equal to either (a) the reserve-adjusted LIBOR rate for interest periods of one, two or three months, plus an applicable rate of 4.00% per annum, or (b) the Alternate Base Rate, plus an applicable rate of 2.00% per annum. Alternate Base Rate\u201d will be equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate as quoted from time to time in The Wall Street Journal or published by the Federal Reserve Board, (2) the overnight bank funding rate established by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 50 basis points, and (3) one-month reserve-adjusted LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Alternate Base Rate is subject to a floor\u201d of 2.0%, and the adjusted LIBOR rate is subject to a floor\u201d of 1.0%. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding Term Loan borrowings was 5.0% per annum. The Term Loan B is repayable in equal quarterly installments commencing on September 30, 2020 in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the Term B Facility (subject to certain reductions in connection with debt prepayments and debt buybacks). The entire unpaid principal balance of the Term Loan B, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will be due and payable at maturity on June 30, 2027. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt.\"\nOther Debt\nIn January 2013, Neenah Germany entered into a project financing agreement for the construction of a melt blown machine (the \"Second German Loan Agreement\"). The Second German Loan Agreement provides for \u20ac9.0 million of construction financing which is secured by the melt blown machine. The loan matures in September 2022 and principal is repaid in equal quarterly installments. At December 31, 2020, \u20ac2.0 million ($2.4 million, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2020) was outstanding under the Second German Loan Agreement.\nIn May 2018, Neenah Germany entered into a project financing agreement for construction of a regenerative thermal oxidizer (the \"Third German Loan Agreement\") to increase the capacity of the existing saturators and ensure compliance with new European air emission standards. The agreement provides for \u20ac5.0 million of financing and is secured by the asset. The loan matures in September 2022 and principal is repaid in 13 equal quarterly installments beginning in June 2019. The interest rate on amounts outstanding is 1.45 percent based on actual days elapsed in a 360-day year and is payable quarterly. In the fourth quarter 2018, we received a subsidy from the German government of $0.9 million due to completion of the regenerative thermal oxidizer project. At December 31, 2020, \u20ac2.1 million ($2.6 million, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2020) was outstanding under the Third German Loan Agreement.\n\u2022Availability under our Global Revolving Credit Facility varies over time depending on the value of our inventory, receivables and (in the case of the German Revolving Credit Facility) various capital assets. As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings, and $0.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, outstanding under our Global Revolving Credit Facility and $138.6 million of available credit (based on exchange rates at December 31, 2020).\n\u2022We have required debt payments through December 31, 2021 of $4.9 million on the Term Loan B and the Second and Third German Loan Agreements\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, our cash balance of $37.1 million consists of $16.6 million in the U.S. and $20.5 million held at entities outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, there were no restrictions regarding the repatriation of our non-U.S. cash.\nTransactions with Shareholders\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.47 per common share or $31.9 million and $0.45 per common share or $30.5 million, respectively.\n\u2022In November 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a program for the purchase of up to $25 million of outstanding common stock effective January 1, 2021 (\"Stock Purchase Plan\"). The program does not require the Company to purchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Purchases under the Stock Purchase Plan will be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with the requirements of applicable law. The timing and amount of any purchases will depend on share price, market conditions and other factors. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired approximately 59,577 shares of Common Stock at a cost of $3.6 million. For further details on our Stock Purchase Plans refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Stockholders' Equity.\"\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we acquired approximately 22,064 and 17,774 shares of Common Stock, respectively, at a cost of $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for shares surrendered by employees to pay taxes due on vested restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights exercised.\n\u2022Under the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are permitted to pay cash dividends on, and repurchase shares of, our common stock without limitation, as long as our specified excess availability under the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement exceeds the greater of (i) $20 million and (ii) 12.5% of our aggregate commitments under the Global Revolving Credit Facility (approximately $22 million as of December 31, 2020), on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such dividend or stock repurchase (as the case may be). If our specified excess availability, on a pro forma basis, is less than the applicable threshold, we are subject to certain restrictions on the amount of cash dividends we are permitted to declare and the amount of share repurchases we are permitted to execute. As of December 31, 2020, our availability was $138.6 million, so this restriction did not apply. See our availability under the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt.\"\n\u2022Under the most restrictive terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, we are permitted to pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed $8.75 million per fiscal quarter. However, as long as the total leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the Term Loan Credit Agreement does not exceed 2.5 to 1.0, we can pay dividends or repurchase shares without limitation. In the event the total leverage ratio exceeds 2.5 to 1.0, but is less than or equal to 3.5 to 1.0, we may still pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount in excess of $8.75 million per fiscal quarter by utilizing certain \"restricted payment baskets\" described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. In addition, we would be permitted to pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock in excess of $8.75 million per fiscal quarter if the aggregate amount of such payments, together with the amount of redemptions or prepayments of certain indebtedness, is less than or equal to the greater of (i) $65 million and (ii) 9% of our consolidated tangible assets. As of December 31, 2020, since our total leverage ratio was less than 2.5 to 1.0, none of these covenants were restrictive to our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Beyond\n2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt payments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt (a) </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open purchase orders (b) </td> <td> </td> <td>83.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other post-employment benefits (c) </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contributions to pension trusts and other benefit obligations (d) </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum purchase commitments (e) </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (f) </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>421.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________\n(a)Interest payments on long-term debt includes interest on variable rate debt at December 31, 2020 weighted average interest rates.\n(b)The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts we anticipate will become payable within the next 12 months for goods and services that we have negotiated for delivery.\n(c)The above table includes future payments that we will make for postretirement benefits other than pensions. Those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations.\n(d)We expect to make aggregate contributions to qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension trusts and to pay pension benefits for unfunded pension of $5.8 million in 2021. The amount also includes estimated payments of $0.1 million per year over 20 years for the withdrawal liability from PIUMPF. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits.\"\n(e)The minimum purchase commitments in 2020 are primarily for utilities and information technology contracts. Although we are primarily liable for payments on the above minimum purchase commitments, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe our exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.\n(f)We adopted the ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) accounting standard in 2019 by recognizing the present value of the lease payments above as right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Leases.\"\nOther Items\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, we had $28.2 million of U.S. federal and $7.4 million of U.S. state R&D Credits which, if not used, will expire between 2028 and 2040 for the U.S. federal R&D Credits and between 2021 and 2035 for the state R&D Credits. As of December 31, 2020, we had $71.8 million of state net operating losses (NOLs) which may be used to offset state taxable income. The NOLs are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a deferred income tax asset of $4.4 million. If not used, substantially all of the NOLs will expire in various amounts between 2021 and 2040.\n\u2022Management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our borrowing capacity are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending and other cash needs for the next 12 months. Our ability to generate adequate cash from operations beyond 2020 will depend on, among other things, our ability to successfully implement our business strategies, control costs in line with market conditions and manage the impact of changes in input prices and currencies. We can give no assurance we will be able to successfully implement these items.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for a description of accounting standards adopted in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. The critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regard to estimates used. These critical judgments relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of expenses.\nThe following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of our financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nInventories\nWe value U.S. inventories at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method, or market. German and Dutch inventories are valued at the lower of cost, using a weighted-average cost method, or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") value of U.S. inventories valued on the LIFO method was $88.5 million and $102.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively and exceeded such LIFO value by $6.4 million and $8.9 million, respectively. Cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these materials and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. Since we value most of our inventory utilizing the LIFO inventory costing methodology, rapid changes in raw material costs have an immediate impact on our operating results.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Our effective income tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items, such as R&D Credits, foreign tax rate differences, tax effects of foreign financing structures, changes in statutory tax rates and excess tax benefits from stock compensation. While we believe that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our liability for uncertain income taxes positions was $8.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires considerable judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions occur, and a resulting income tax liability is recorded when management concludes that an income tax position fails to achieve a more likely than not recognition threshold. When this occurs, the amount of tax benefits recognized may differ from the amount taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. These differences represent unrecognized tax benefits and\nare reviewed at each reporting period based on facts, circumstances, available evidence and applicable laws. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $5.3 million and $5.2 million of foreign tax credits, all of which the Company believes will expire unutilized. Therefore, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded a valuation allowance which was equal to the balance of the deferred income tax asset. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company also had a valuation allowance of $6.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, against the gross value of its state tax credits and NOLs. Including the federal benefit of state taxes, the net valuation allowance reflected on the consolidated balance sheets was $5.1 million and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers many factors, including specific taxing jurisdictions, sources of taxable income, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nConsolidated pension expense related to continuing operations for defined benefit pension plans was $4.0 million, $3.7 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 7, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\" for components of net periodic benefit cost. Accounting for defined benefit pension plans requires various assumptions, including, but not limited to, discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, future compensation growth rates and mortality rates. Accounting for our postretirement benefit plans also requires various assumptions, which include, but are not limited to, discount rates and annual rates of increase in the per capita costs of health care benefits.\nThe following chart summarizes the more significant assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit plans for each of the past three years:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension plans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average discount rate for benefit expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.78 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average discount rate for benefit obligation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.98 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.94 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term rate on plan assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5.42 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.91 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.78 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase for benefit expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.05 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.44 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postretirement benefit plans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average discount rate for benefit expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.68 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average discount rate for benefit obligation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.68 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.84 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.80 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultimate cost trend rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year that the ultimate cost trend rate is reached\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2037 </td> <td> </td> <td>2037 </td> <td> </td> <td>2037 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in the U.S. is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of AA-rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place, whose duration matches the timing of expected pension benefit payments. The discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in Germany is generally based on the IBOXX index of AA-rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected pension benefit payments.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets held by our pension trusts was determined based on several factors, including input from pension investment consultants and projected long-term returns of broad equity and bond indices. We also considered the plans' historical 10-year and 15-year compounded annual returns. We evaluate our investment strategy and long-term rate of return on pension asset assumptions at least annually.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, consolidated postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit expense was $2.9 million, $3.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit obligations in the U.S. is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of AA-rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place, whose duration matches the timing of expected postretirement health care and life insurance benefit payments. The discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future postretirement health\ncare and life insurance obligations for our foreign benefit plans is generally based on an index of AA-rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected benefit payments.\nWe evaluate these assumptions at least once each year or as facts and circumstances dictate and we make changes as conditions warrant. Changes to these assumptions will increase or decrease our reported net periodic benefit expense, which will result in changes to the recorded benefit plan assets and liabilities.\nUseful Life and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nFor financial reporting purposes, depreciation is principally computed on the straight-line method over estimated useful asset lives. The weighted average remaining useful lives for buildings, land improvements and machinery and equipment are approximately 17 years, 20 years and 9 years respectively. We also use units-of-production method of depreciation for the U.S. transportation filtration production assets with a gross book value of $29.4 million, which reflects the nature of the assets' utilization.\nProperty, plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (\"ASC Topic 360\"), whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long-lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pre-tax cash flows. Impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines, future sales volumes, growth rates for selling prices and costs, alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets. An asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pre-tax cash flows from the use of the asset (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount. We estimate fair value based on an expected present value technique using multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate.\nThe estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the adverse impacts of COVID-19, the Company recorded asset restructuring and impairment costs of $55.3 million, of which $52.3 million related to a non-cash impairment loss for long-lived assets used primarily in the Technical Products segment. The other charge of $3.0 million arose from accelerated depreciation due to the idling of assets and related employee termination benefits for a workforce reduction in the Fine Paper and Packaging segment. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Restructuring and Impairment Costs\" for further discussion.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives\nWe test goodwill for impairment at least annually in conjunction with preparation of Neenah's annual business plan, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired.\nWe tested goodwill for impairment as of November 30, 2020 under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. In this quantitative assessment, the Company estimated the fair value of the reporting units using a market approach in combination with a discounted operating cash flow approach. Significant assumptions used in developing the discounted operating cash flow approach were revenue growth rates and pricing, costs for manufacturing inputs, levels of capital investment and estimated cost of capital for high, medium and low growth environments. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not. As of November 30, 2020, no impairment was indicated.\nOther Intangible Assets\nCertain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not amortized. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are annually reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350.\nAcquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360. Intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, trade names and acquired intellectual property. Such intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of between 10 and 15 years.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment loss for its indefinite-lived intangible assets (brand names) of $0.9 million and $0.4 million in the Fine Paper and Packaging and Technical Products segments, respectively, due to the adverse impacts of the pandemic. See Note 12, \"Asset Restructuring and Impairment Costs.\" Our annual test of other intangible assets for impairment at November 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 indicated that the carrying amount of such assets was recoverable.\nAcquisition Accounting\nWe account for acquisitions under ASC Topic 805, which requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. The accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimates, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. The assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models. Projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for our business. The impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020. Also discussed is our financial position as of the end of this year. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. A detailed discussion of year ended December 31, 2019 can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2020.\nIntroduction\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the historical performance of our business, its financial condition and its prospects. We will discuss and provide our analysis of the following:\n\u2022Overview of Business;\n\u2022Business Segments;\n\u2022Results of Operations and Related Information;\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources;\n\u2022Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements; and\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates.\nOverview of Business\nWe are a leading global producer of specialty materials for niche markets. We have two primary operations: our technical products business and our fine paper and packaging business.\nOur mission is to create critical components that create possibilities for our customers and end-users. We expect to create value by growing in markets where product performance or image is valued and where we have competitive advantages. In managing our businesses, we believe that achieving and maintaining a leadership position in our markets, responding effectively to customer needs and competitive challenges, employing capital optimally, controlling costs and managing risks are important to long-term success. Changes in general economic conditions and timing of changes in input costs and selling prices can also impact our results. In this discussion and analysis, we will refer to these factors.\nBusiness Segments\nOur reportable operating segments consist of Technical Products and Fine Paper and Packaging.\nOur technical products business is a leading international producer of transportation, water and other filter media and durable, saturated and coated substrates for a variety of end markets. We focus on categories where we believe we are, or can be, a market leader. These categories include filtration media for transportation, water and other end use applications, backings for specialty tapes and abrasives, performance labels, digital transfer papers, and other custom engineered materials. Our products are typically used in high performance applications where our customers require specific standards and qualifications. Our dedicated technical products manufacturing facilities are located in Weidach and Bruckm\u00fchl, Germany, Eerbeek, Netherlands, Bolton, England, Munising, Michigan, Appleton, Wisconsin, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts.\nOur fine paper and packaging business is a leading supplier of premium printing, packaging, and other high-end specialty papers predominantly in North America. Our products include some of the most recognized and preferred brands in North America, where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories. Often these papers are characterized by distinctive finishing, colors, textures and coating. We sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors, as well as through converters, major national retailers and specialty businesses. Our dedicated fine paper and packaging\nmanufacturing facilities are located in Whiting and Neenah, Wisconsin, and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. In addition, certain products of both segments are manufactured in shared facilities located in Brownville and Lowville, New York, and Quakertown, Pennsylvania.\nResults of Operations and Related Information\nIn this section, we discuss and analyze our net sales, income before interest and income taxes (which we refer to as \"operating income\") and other information relevant to an understanding of our results of operations.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nIn 2020, we faced adverse impacts of the outbreak of COVID-19 which resulted in the decline in global economic activity and significantly reduced demand for our products and our customers' products. While we experienced varying degrees of recovery in our markets, the pandemic had a material negative impact on our business operations and financial results, including net sales and earnings. Both of our business segments have continued to operate during the pandemic as essential suppliers of goods and services and we continue to take steps to ensure the safety of our employees, including frequent cleaning and disinfection of workspaces, property and equipment, instituting social distancing measures and providing remote working environments for administrative employees. We experienced a limited number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in our operations and quarantined those individuals and first level exposed employees in accordance with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the \"CDC\") guidelines. Such cases did not cause any significant disruption to operations, nor have we experienced material disruptions to our supply chain.\nManagement implemented a number of actions to preserve the safety of our employees (as discussed in Human Capital section of Item 1. \"Business\"), carefully control and reduce spending, and preserve liquidity by actively managing working capital. These actions included the following:\n\u2022reducing discretionary spending;\n\u2022minimizing capital expenditures and discretionary contributions to pension plans;\n\u2022suspending stock repurchases under our 2020 Stock Purchase Plan;\n\u2022utilizing government initiatives and subsidies such as deferring payroll taxes under the CARES Act, government employee retention subsidies in the U.S., Europe and the U.K., and net operating loss carrybacks;\n\u2022consolidating our manufacturing footprint; and\n\u2022reducing payroll costs through a freeze on wage increases and hiring, furloughs for all U.S. employees, and reductions in our salaried and hourly headcount.\nExecutive Summary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, consolidated net sales of $792.6 million decreased $145.9 million, or 16 percent, from $938.5 million in 2019. The decline in revenues resulted primarily from significant adverse volume impacts from COVID-19. Net sales declined 6% in Technical Products and 29% in Fine Paper and Packaging. In addition, net selling prices were modestly lower in 2020 due both to selling price and mix. The decline in net sales was more pronounced in the Fine Paper and Packaging segment due to reductions in end-use demand for commercial print papers used in advertising and marketing. While down versus prior year, third and fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net sales increased 18% and 8%, respectively, from each of the preceding quarters, as the global markets continued to recover.\nConsolidated operating income decreased $84.4 million from the prior year to a loss of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding adjusting items noted below, operating income decreased $18.7 million due primarily to lower sales and manufacturing cost inefficiencies related to COVID-19. The impact of lower volumes was only partly offset by spending reductions and lower input costs net of selling price reductions. As presented on the reconciliation table on page 35, we recorded $70.5 million of adjusting items in 2020 including non-cash asset restructuring and impairment costs for long-lived assets, other restructuring and non-routine costs, incremental costs of responding to COVID-19, loss on debt extinguishment, pension and SERP settlements and acquisition due diligence costs. Adjusting items of $4.8 million in 2019 included accelerated depreciation due to idling of a fine paper machine, restructuring and other non-routine costs and pension related gain.\nCash provided by operating activities of $93.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4.2 million lower than cash provided by operating activities of $97.6 million in the prior year. Actions to improve working capital and to reduce spending largely offset the impact from lower earnings.\nCapital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $18.9 million compared to $21.4 million in the prior year. Lower capital spending in 2020 of $2.5 million was due to actions to minimize capital spending.\nAnalysis of Net Sales - Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table presents net sales by segment and net sales expressed as a percentage of total net sales:\n\nCommentary:\nYear 2020 versus 2019\n\nConsolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $145.9 million (16%) lower than the prior year. The decline in revenues resulted primarily from significant adverse volume impacts from COVID-19. Net sales declined 6% in Technical Products and 29% in Fine Paper and Packaging. In addition, net selling prices were modestly lower in 2020 due both to selling price and mix. The decline in net sales was more pronounced in the Fine Paper and Packaging segment due to reductions in end-use demand for commercial print papers used in advertising and marketing. While down versus prior year, third and fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net sales increased 18% and 8%, respectively, from each of the preceding quarters, as the global markets continued to recover.\n\u2022Net sales in our technical products business decreased $32.7 million (6%) from the prior year. The revenue decrease resulted primarily from lower net selling prices partly as a result of declines in input costs as well as a lower value mix of products sold, and lower volumes reflecting adverse impacts of COVID-19. These factors were only partly offset by increased sales of filtration products, including media for face masks in Europe launched in 2020.\n\u2022Net sales in our fine paper and packaging business decreased $113.2 million (29%) from the prior year. The decline was primarily due to lower volumes, reflecting adverse impacts of COVID-19. Volume declines were more pronounced in commercial print as compared to premium packaging and consumer channel sales. Net selling prices were lower partly as a result of declines in input costs as well as a lower value mix of products sold.\nAnalysis of Operating Income - Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table sets forth line items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated and is intended to provide a perspective of trends in our historical results:\n\nCommentary:\nYear 2020 versus 2019\n\n_______________________\n(a)Includes price changes, net of changes in product mix.\n(b)Includes price changes for raw materials and energy.\n(c)Includes other manufacturing costs, over (under) absorption of fixed costs, distribution and selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses. In addition, in 2020, it included $57.1 million, $7.8 million, and $5.6 million of unfavorable adjustments in Technical Products, Fine Paper and Packaging, and Unallocated corporate costs, respectively. In 2019, it included non-routine costs of $6.2 million primarily related to the accelerated depreciation and other costs related to the consolidation of the fine paper manufacturing footprint with the idling of a paper machine, and $1.4 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to the curtailment gain for the Neenah Coldenhove pension plan. See the breakdown by segment and the reconciliation table on page 35 for further detail.\nConsolidated operating income decreased $84.4 million from prior year to a loss of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding adjusting items noted below, operating income decreased $18.7 million due primarily to lower sales and manufacturing cost inefficiencies related to COVID-19. The impact of lower volumes was only partly offset by spending reductions and lower input costs net of selling price reductions. As presented on the reconciliation table on page 35, we recorded $70.5 million of adjusting items in 2020 including non-cash asset restructuring and impairment costs for long-lived assets, other restructuring and non-routine costs, incremental costs of responding to COVID-19, loss on debt extinguishment, pension and SERP settlements and acquisition due diligence costs. Adjusting items of $4.8 million in 2019 included accelerated depreciation due to idling of a fine paper machine, restructuring and other non-routine costs and pension related gain.\n\u2022Operating income for our technical products business decreased $49.4 million from prior year to a loss of 4.8 million. Excluding unfavorable adjusting items discussed above and shown on the reconciliation table on page 35, adjusted operating income increased $8.9 million (21%), primarily as a result of lower input costs net of selling price reductions, a more profitable mix of filtration products (including media for face masks) and reductions in SG&A and other spending. These were partly offset by lower sales and production volumes and related manufacturing cost inefficiencies.\n\u2022Operating income for our fine paper and packaging business decreased $29.9 million (56%) from the prior year period. Excluding unfavorable adjusting items discussed above and shown on the reconciliation table on page 35, adjusted operating income decreased $27.8 million (47%) from the prior year primarily as a result of lower sales and production volumes and related manufacturing cost inefficiencies. The impact of lower volumes was only partly offset by spending reductions and lower input costs net of selling price reductions.\n\u2022Unallocated corporate costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $24.6 million, or $5.1 million higher than the prior year. Excluding unfavorable adjusting items discussed above and shown on the reconciliation table on page 35, the unallocated corporate costs decreased $0.2 million from prior year.\n \nThe following table sets forth our operating income by segment, adjusted for the effects of certain costs, for the periods indicated:\n\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), consolidated operating income includes the pre-tax effects of asset restructuring and impairment costs, other restructuring and non-routine costs, COVID-19 costs, loss on debt extinguishment, pension and SERP adjustments, and acquisition due diligence costs. We believe that by adjusting reported operating income to exclude the effects of such items, the resulting adjusted operating income is on a basis that reflects the results of our ongoing operations. In assessing COVID-19 impacts, we excluded only costs which were unusual, incremental and directly attributable to mitigating the effects COVID-19 on our operations. We believe that providing adjusted operating results will help investors gain an additional perspective of underlying business trends and results. Adjusted operating income is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for operating income derived in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may use different methodologies for calculating their non-GAAP financial measures and, accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to their measures.\nAdditional Statement of Operations Commentary:\n\u2022SG&A expense of $88.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10.6 million lower than 2019. Costs in 2020 were lower due to actions taken to reduce costs in areas including marketing, travel, and payroll-related spending, including impacts of furloughs, headcount reductions and wage and hiring freezes. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 11.2 percent remained comparable to 10.5 percent in 2019 despite lower sales.\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred $12.6 million and $11.8 million of interest expense, respectively. In addition to higher debt in the second half of 2020, 2020 interest expense included an incremental $0.4 million due to an overlap in interest incurred in July on both our Senior Notes and Term Loan B, prior to the redemption of the 2021 Senior Notes on July 16, 2020.\n\u2022Income tax expense (benefit) represented (16) percent and 17 percent of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In general, our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to impacts of changes in the mix of earnings in taxing jurisdictions with differing statutory rates, the impact of R&D and other tax credits, changes in tax laws and changes in corporate structure as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, our effective income tax (benefit) rate related to continuing operations of (16) percent was significantly impacted by the effects of the pre-tax loss in the U.S. resulting from the $52.3 million asset impairment loss of the U.S. transportation filtration asset (see Note 12, \"Asset Restructuring and Impairment Costs\" of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2020. Also, as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 and other factors, we evaluated our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, including research and development and other tax credits and NOLs, before they expire. During 2020, the effective income tax (benefit) rate was negatively impacted by a $4.6 million increase to the valuation allowance against our state tax credits and NOLs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our effective income tax rate related to continuing operations was 17 percent, primarily due to the tax benefit of R&D tax credits generated during the year.\n\u2022On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\"). The CARES Act included various income and payroll tax provisions designed to stimulate the economy and provide relief to businesses. Among its benefits was the ability to enhance the value of NOLs by allowing the carryback of NOLs to tax years in which the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate was 35%. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $0.9 million and a corresponding tax receivable of $8.0 million for this tax refund to be received during 2021. In addition, we generated cash tax savings from the option to delay payment of $4.4 million of 2020 U.S. payroll taxes until December 31, 2021 and 2022. We also utilized the payroll tax provisions of the Employee Retention Credit of the CARES Act to partially offset qualified wages and benefits of employees impacted by COVID-19 travel and other work restrictions. We utilized similar COVID-19 relief measures in Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. aimed at providing subsidies for employee retention and deferral of tax payments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that we have a strong financial position and the liquidity to withstand economic uncertainty during this volatile period, in consideration of the following:\n\u2022$37.1 million of cash and cash equivalents was on hand at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022we had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2020 under our Global Revolving Credit Facility; with a significant remaining availability of $138.6 million;\n\u2022we have no near-term debt maturities, as the Global Revolving Credit Facility matures in December 2023 and the Term Loan B facility matures in June 2027;\n\nOperating Cash Flow Commentary\n\u2022Cash provided by operating activities of $93.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4.2 million lower than cash provided by operating activities of $97.6 million in the prior year. Actions to improve working capital and to reduce spending largely offset the impact from lower earnings.\nInvesting Cash Flow Commentary:\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash used by investing activities was $19.5 million and $23.3 million, respectively. Capital spending was reduced in 2020 by $2.5 million to preserve liquidity.\n\u2022Going forward, we expect aggregate annual capital expenditures to return to a range of approximately 2 to 4 percent of net sales. We believe that this level of capital spending can be funded from cash provided from operating activities and allows us to maintain the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our assets while also investing in expanded capabilities to successfully pursue strategic initiatives and deliver attractive returns.\nFinancing Cash Flow Commentary:\nOur liquidity requirements are provided by cash generated from operations and short- and long-term borrowings.\n\u2022On July 16, 2020, we completed the redemption in full of the $175 million of 2021 Senior Notes using the $200 million of proceeds from the Term Loan B which we entered into on June 30, 2020.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used by financing activities was $47.0 million compared to cash used by financing activities of $75.2 million for the prior year. The change was due to lower net debt repayments of $4.3 million in 2020 compared to $38.1 million in the prior year.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents increased $28.1 million to $37.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $9.0 million at December 31, 2019. Total debt decreased $6.4 million to $194.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $200.8 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in total debt reflects repayment of all\namounts outstanding under the Global Revolving Credit Facility and scheduled repayments of the Term Loan B and other debt (described below), which exceeded the net incremental borrowing from the Term Loan B (compared to the extinguished 2021 Senior Notes). Net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) decreased by $34.5 million.\n\u2022We have the following credit facilities:\nGlobal Revolving Credit Facility\nOn June 30, 2020, we amended our principal credit agreement (Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) to among other things, (a) remove the applicable components of the Term Loan B Priority Collateral (as defined in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statement included herein) from the borrowing base calculation under the Global Revolving Credit Facility, (b) permit the pledging of the Collateral under the Term B Facility and subordinate liens of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement lenders on Term Loan B Priority Collateral to the first position liens on Term Loan B Priority Collateral under the Term B Facility, (c) reduce the U.S. revolving credit facility amount from $150 million to $125 million, (d) reduce the German revolving credit facility amount from $75 million to $50 million, and (e) adjust certain reporting and financial covenant activation and deactivation thresholds. The variable interest rates on our revolving credit facility are based on LIBOR as a benchmark, exposing us to possible changes in interest in the event that the method for determining LIBOR changes, LIBOR is replaced by an alternative reference rate or LIBOR is phased out altogether. The impact related to any changes cannot be predicted at this time. As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Global Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt.\"\nTerm Loan B Facility\nOn July 16, 2020, we completed the redemption in full of the $175 million of 2021 Senior Notes using the $200 million of proceeds from the Term Loan B which we entered into on June 30, 2020. Under the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, and subject to certain conditions and adjustments, the Company may from time to time solicit the Term Loan B Lenders or new lenders to provide incremental term loan financings under the Term B Facility up to $125 million in the aggregate (each an \"Incremental Term Facility\"). Under the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, borrowings under the Term B Facility will bear interest, as selected by the Company, at a per annum rate equal to either (a) the reserve-adjusted LIBOR rate for interest periods of one, two or three months, plus an applicable rate of 4.00% per annum, or (b) the Alternate Base Rate, plus an applicable rate of 2.00% per annum. Alternate Base Rate\u201d will be equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate as quoted from time to time in The Wall Street Journal or published by the Federal Reserve Board, (2) the overnight bank funding rate established by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 50 basis points, and (3) one-month reserve-adjusted LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Alternate Base Rate is subject to a floor\u201d of 2.0%, and the adjusted LIBOR rate is subject to a floor\u201d of 1.0%. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding Term Loan borrowings was 5.0% per annum. The Term Loan B is repayable in equal quarterly installments commencing on September 30, 2020 in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the Term B Facility (subject to certain reductions in connection with debt prepayments and debt buybacks). The entire unpaid principal balance of the Term Loan B, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will be due and payable at maturity on June 30, 2027. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt.\"\nOther Debt\nIn January 2013, Neenah Germany entered into a project financing agreement for the construction of a melt blown machine (the \"Second German Loan Agreement\"). The Second German Loan Agreement provides for \u20ac9.0 million of construction financing which is secured by the melt blown machine. The loan matures in September 2022 and principal is repaid in equal quarterly installments. At December 31, 2020, \u20ac2.0 million ($2.4 million, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2020) was outstanding under the Second German Loan Agreement.\nIn May 2018, Neenah Germany entered into a project financing agreement for construction of a regenerative thermal oxidizer (the \"Third German Loan Agreement\") to increase the capacity of the existing saturators and ensure compliance with new European air emission standards. The agreement provides for \u20ac5.0 million of financing and is secured by the asset. The loan matures in September 2022 and principal is repaid in 13 equal quarterly installments beginning in June 2019. The interest rate on amounts outstanding is 1.45 percent based on actual days elapsed in a 360-day year and is payable quarterly. In the fourth quarter 2018, we received a subsidy from the German government of $0.9 million due to completion of the regenerative thermal oxidizer project. At December 31, 2020, \u20ac2.1 million ($2.6 million, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2020) was outstanding under the Third German Loan Agreement.\n\u2022Availability under our Global Revolving Credit Facility varies over time depending on the value of our inventory, receivables and (in the case of the German Revolving Credit Facility) various capital assets. As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings, and $0.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, outstanding under our Global Revolving Credit Facility and $138.6 million of available credit (based on exchange rates at December 31, 2020).\n\u2022We have required debt payments through December 31, 2021 of $4.9 million on the Term Loan B and the Second and Third German Loan Agreements\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, our cash balance of $37.1 million consists of $16.6 million in the U.S. and $20.5 million held at entities outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, there were no restrictions regarding the repatriation of our non-U.S. cash.\nTransactions with Shareholders\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.47 per common share or $31.9 million and $0.45 per common share or $30.5 million, respectively.\n\u2022In November 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a program for the purchase of up to $25 million of outstanding common stock effective January 1, 2021 (\"Stock Purchase Plan\"). The program does not require the Company to purchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Purchases under the Stock Purchase Plan will be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with the requirements of applicable law. The timing and amount of any purchases will depend on share price, market conditions and other factors. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired approximately 59,577 shares of Common Stock at a cost of $3.6 million. For further details on our Stock Purchase Plans refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Stockholders' Equity.\"\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we acquired approximately 22,064 and 17,774 shares of Common Stock, respectively, at a cost of $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for shares surrendered by employees to pay taxes due on vested restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights exercised.\n\u2022Under the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are permitted to pay cash dividends on, and repurchase shares of, our common stock without limitation, as long as our specified excess availability under the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement exceeds the greater of (i) $20 million and (ii) 12.5% of our aggregate commitments under the Global Revolving Credit Facility (approximately $22 million as of December 31, 2020), on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such dividend or stock repurchase (as the case may be). If our specified excess availability, on a pro forma basis, is less than the applicable threshold, we are subject to certain restrictions on the amount of cash dividends we are permitted to declare and the amount of share repurchases we are permitted to execute. As of December 31, 2020, our availability was $138.6 million, so this restriction did not apply. See our availability under the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt.\"\n\u2022Under the most restrictive terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, we are permitted to pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed $8.75 million per fiscal quarter. However, as long as the total leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the Term Loan Credit Agreement does not exceed 2.5 to 1.0, we can pay dividends or repurchase shares without limitation. In the event the total leverage ratio exceeds 2.5 to 1.0, but is less than or equal to 3.5 to 1.0, we may still pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount in excess of $8.75 million per fiscal quarter by utilizing certain \"restricted payment baskets\" described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. In addition, we would be permitted to pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock in excess of $8.75 million per fiscal quarter if the aggregate amount of such payments, together with the amount of redemptions or prepayments of certain indebtedness, is less than or equal to the greater of (i) $65 million and (ii) 9% of our consolidated tangible assets. As of December 31, 2020, since our total leverage ratio was less than 2.5 to 1.0, none of these covenants were restrictive to our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable as of December 31, 2020:\n\n_______________________\n(a)Interest payments on long-term debt includes interest on variable rate debt at December 31, 2020 weighted average interest rates.\n(b)The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts we anticipate will become payable within the next 12 months for goods and services that we have negotiated for delivery.\n(c)The above table includes future payments that we will make for postretirement benefits other than pensions. Those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations.\n(d)We expect to make aggregate contributions to qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension trusts and to pay pension benefits for unfunded pension of $5.8 million in 2021. The amount also includes estimated payments of $0.1 million per year over 20 years for the withdrawal liability from PIUMPF. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits.\"\n(e)The minimum purchase commitments in 2020 are primarily for utilities and information technology contracts. Although we are primarily liable for payments on the above minimum purchase commitments, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe our exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.\n(f)We adopted the ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) accounting standard in 2019 by recognizing the present value of the lease payments above as right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Leases.\"\nOther Items\n\u2022As of December 31, 2020, we had $28.2 million of U.S. federal and $7.4 million of U.S. state R&D Credits which, if not used, will expire between 2028 and 2040 for the U.S. federal R&D Credits and between 2021 and 2035 for the state R&D Credits. As of December 31, 2020, we had $71.8 million of state net operating losses (NOLs) which may be used to offset state taxable income. The NOLs are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a deferred income tax asset of $4.4 million. If not used, substantially all of the NOLs will expire in various amounts between 2021 and 2040.\n\u2022Management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our borrowing capacity are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending and other cash needs for the next 12 months. Our ability to generate adequate cash from operations beyond 2020 will depend on, among other things, our ability to successfully implement our business strategies, control costs in line with market conditions and manage the impact of changes in input prices and currencies. We can give no assurance we will be able to successfully implement these items.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\" for a description of accounting standards adopted in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. The critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regard to estimates used. These critical judgments relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of expenses.\nThe following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of our financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nInventories\nWe value U.S. inventories at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method, or market. German and Dutch inventories are valued at the lower of cost, using a weighted-average cost method, or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") value of U.S. inventories valued on the LIFO method was $88.5 million and $102.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively and exceeded such LIFO value by $6.4 million and $8.9 million, respectively. Cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these materials and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. Since we value most of our inventory utilizing the LIFO inventory costing methodology, rapid changes in raw material costs have an immediate impact on our operating results.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Our effective income tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items, such as R&D Credits, foreign tax rate differences, tax effects of foreign financing structures, changes in statutory tax rates and excess tax benefits from stock compensation. While we believe that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our liability for uncertain income taxes positions was $8.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires considerable judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions occur, and a resulting income tax liability is recorded when management concludes that an income tax position fails to achieve a more likely than not recognition threshold. When this occurs, the amount of tax benefits recognized may differ from the amount taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. These differences represent unrecognized tax benefits and\nare reviewed at each reporting period based on facts, circumstances, available evidence and applicable laws. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $5.3 million and $5.2 million of foreign tax credits, all of which the Company believes will expire unutilized. Therefore, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded a valuation allowance which was equal to the balance of the deferred income tax asset. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company also had a valuation allowance of $6.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, against the gross value of its state tax credits and NOLs. Including the federal benefit of state taxes, the net valuation allowance reflected on the consolidated balance sheets was $5.1 million and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers many factors, including specific taxing jurisdictions, sources of taxable income, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nConsolidated pension expense related to continuing operations for defined benefit pension plans was $4.0 million, $3.7 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 7, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\" for components of net periodic benefit cost. Accounting for defined benefit pension plans requires various assumptions, including, but not limited to, discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, future compensation growth rates and mortality rates. Accounting for our postretirement benefit plans also requires various assumptions, which include, but are not limited to, discount rates and annual rates of increase in the per capita costs of health care benefits.\nThe following chart summarizes the more significant assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit plans for each of the past three years:\n\nThe discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in the U.S. is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of AA-rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place, whose duration matches the timing of expected pension benefit payments. The discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in Germany is generally based on the IBOXX index of AA-rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected pension benefit payments.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets held by our pension trusts was determined based on several factors, including input from pension investment consultants and projected long-term returns of broad equity and bond indices. We also considered the plans' historical 10-year and 15-year compounded annual returns. We evaluate our investment strategy and long-term rate of return on pension asset assumptions at least annually.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, consolidated postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit expense was $2.9 million, $3.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit obligations in the U.S. is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of AA-rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place, whose duration matches the timing of expected postretirement health care and life insurance benefit payments. The discount (or settlement) rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future postretirement health\ncare and life insurance obligations for our foreign benefit plans is generally based on an index of AA-rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected benefit payments.\nWe evaluate these assumptions at least once each year or as facts and circumstances dictate and we make changes as conditions warrant. Changes to these assumptions will increase or decrease our reported net periodic benefit expense, which will result in changes to the recorded benefit plan assets and liabilities.\nUseful Life and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nFor financial reporting purposes, depreciation is principally computed on the straight-line method over estimated useful asset lives. The weighted average remaining useful lives for buildings, land improvements and machinery and equipment are approximately 17 years, 20 years and 9 years respectively. We also use units-of-production method of depreciation for the U.S. transportation filtration production assets with a gross book value of $29.4 million, which reflects the nature of the assets' utilization.\nProperty, plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (\"ASC Topic 360\"), whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long-lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pre-tax cash flows. Impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines, future sales volumes, growth rates for selling prices and costs, alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets. An asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pre-tax cash flows from the use of the asset (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount. We estimate fair value based on an expected present value technique using multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate.\nThe estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the adverse impacts of COVID-19, the Company recorded asset restructuring and impairment costs of $55.3 million, of which $52.3 million related to a non-cash impairment loss for long-lived assets used primarily in the Technical Products segment. The other charge of $3.0 million arose from accelerated depreciation due to the idling of assets and related employee termination benefits for a workforce reduction in the Fine Paper and Packaging segment. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Restructuring and Impairment Costs\" for further discussion.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives\nWe test goodwill for impairment at least annually in conjunction with preparation of Neenah's annual business plan, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired.\nWe tested goodwill for impairment as of November 30, 2020 under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. In this quantitative assessment, the Company estimated the fair value of the reporting units using a market approach in combination with a discounted operating cash flow approach. Significant assumptions used in developing the discounted operating cash flow approach were revenue growth rates and pricing, costs for manufacturing inputs, levels of capital investment and estimated cost of capital for high, medium and low growth environments. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not. As of November 30, 2020, no impairment was indicated.\nOther Intangible Assets\nCertain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not amortized. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are annually reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350.\nAcquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360. Intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, trade names and acquired intellectual property. Such intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of between 10 and 15 years.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment loss for its indefinite-lived intangible assets (brand names) of $0.9 million and $0.4 million in the Fine Paper and Packaging and Technical Products segments, respectively, due to the adverse impacts of the pandemic. See Note 12, \"Asset Restructuring and Impairment Costs.\" Our annual test of other intangible assets for impairment at November 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 indicated that the carrying amount of such assets was recoverable.\nAcquisition Accounting\nWe account for acquisitions under ASC Topic 805, which requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. The accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimates, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. The assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models. Projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for our business. The impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates.",
