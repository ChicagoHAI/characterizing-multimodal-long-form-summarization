Revenues for 2015 totaled $4.0 billion, an increase of $350 million, or 9.6%, compared to 2014, due to increases in total merchandise sales of $280 million and Financial Services revenue of $72 million.\nTotal merchandise sales increased $280 million, or 8.7%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The most significant factors contributing to the net increase in total merchandise sales comparing 2015 to 2014 included the following:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The impact of the 53rd week in 2015 resulted in an increase in merchandise sales of $84 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Retail revenue increased $321 million in 2015 compared to 2014 from the addition of new retail stores.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Comparable store sales on a consolidated basis decreased $75 million, or 3.4%, compared to 2014. Comparable store sales results for our stores in the United States, which exclude Canada results and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, decreased 2.2% compared to 2014 mostly due to overall decreases in the clothing and footwear product category. We have seen continued softness in this category as our fall and winter apparel and footwear products were met with unseasonably warm weather across most of our major markets. The decrease in the clothing and footwear product category was partially offset by an increase of approximately $11 million in the general outdoors and hunting equipment product categories with neither of these two categories disproportionately impacting the year over year change more than the other category. The decrease in comparable store sales comparing 2015 to 2014 was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 6.2% partially offset by an increase in the average sales per transaction of 4.4%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted for 52 weeks, Direct revenue decreased $45 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to decreases extending across all major product categories attributable to decreases in the\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>clothing and footwear product category of approximately 51%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>hunting equipment product category of approximately 37%, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>general outdoors product category of approximately 12%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA significant factor in the decrease in our clothing and footwear product category was the negative impact that the unseasonably warm weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 had on sales of fall and winter apparel and footwear. The decrease in the hunting equipment product category was due mostly to a shift in ammunition sales from the Direct segment to the Retail segment.\nFinancial Services revenue increased $72 million, or 16.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in Financial Services revenue was primarily due to an increase in interest and fee income due to increases in credit card loans and the revolving rate and an increase in interchange income due to increases in credit card purchases and the interchange rate. Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in the provision for loan losses due primarily to growth in the average outstanding balance of credit card loans and, to a lesser extent, increases in loan delinquencies.\nFor fiscal year 2016, we intend to continue to monitor and take steps that are needed to respond to any number of consumer-related factors that may impact our planned growth in comparable store sales on an annual basis. These steps may include the timing of discounts offered and promotional events to meet consumer preferences or actions taken by our competitors, including demand for firearms and ammunition, which can be very volatile based on current events as well as potential future government regulation. In addition, we will also look at our strategic space allocation and improve space utilization within our stores, as well as changing our brand assortment between national brands and Cabela's brand. We also are working closely with our vendors and actively managing our inventory levels to ensure that we have the adequate quantity and assortment of necessary products available to meet any such consumer-related factors.\nOur merchandise gross profit increased $53 million, or 4.7%, to $1.2 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to new retail store growth. Our merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales decreased 140 basis points to 34.3% in 2015 from 35.7% in 2014 due to our markdown and pricing strategy and, to a lesser extent, increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories. The impact of the decrease due to markdown and pricing strategy was disproportionately higher than the change due to increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories.\nOperating income decreased $28 million, or 8.2%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased 150 basis points to 7.7% in 2015 compared to 9.2% in 2014. The decrease in total operating income was due to increases in consolidated operating expenses and impairment and restructuring charges and a decrease in revenue from our Direct segment. Net increases in revenue from our Retail and Financial Services segments and an increase in our merchandise gross profit partially offset the decrease in total operating income.\nOperating expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of retail stores and costs in related support areas and due to an increase in incentive compensation in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2014, we did not incur any incentive compensation expense. Impairment and restructuring charges increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to (i) impairment losses totaling $10 million relating to the write-off of costs pertaining to previously identified store sites and the write-down to fair value of certain land properties and (ii) a $6 million charge for severance and related benefits due to a corporate office restructure and reduction in the number of personnel.\nIn the second half of 2015, we launched a major multi-year corporate restructuring project aimed at lowering the Company's operating expense base to increase our return on invested capital. We have identified numerous meaningful savings opportunities across the Company, including information technology process improvement, indirect procurement, retail labor optimization, merchandise sourcing, retail support functions, and supply chain enhancements, some of which we have already implemented, that are expected to result in a reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue by 75 to 150 basis points over the next three years. As we focus on expense management controls consistent with our multi-year corporate restructuring project, we plan to continue our omni-channel initiatives, our Cabela's branded product investments, and our retail expansion, with current plans to open eight stores in 2016. We will continue to manage our operating costs accordingly through fiscal 2016.\nFiscal 2015 consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal 2014 consisted of 52 weeks. The table below presents results for 2015 excluding the effect of revenue earned in the last week of 2015 in order to show comparable data with 2014 and reconciles our presentation of total revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) to the non-GAAP presentation excluding the 53rd week results. Management believes these non-GAAP financial results provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding revenues and trends and performance of our ongoing operations and are useful for year-over-year comparisons of such results. In addition, management evaluates results using non-GAAP adjusted total revenue. These non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP. Financial Services was not adjusted because its reporting periods end on a calendar year.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015 (Excluding 53rd Week)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,592,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>241,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>806,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44,965\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total merchandise sales\n</td> <td>3,399,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,202,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>502,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>12,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,722\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue (non-GAAP basis)\n</td> <td>3,913,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,647,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue - week 53\n</td> <td>83,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,997,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,647,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe impact of the 53rd week in 2015 was to increase total revenue and revenue from our merchandising businesses by $84 million. Adjusting to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014, revenues for 2015 totaled $3.9 billion, an increase of 7.3% compared to 2014, and revenue in our merchandising business for 2015 increased $197 million, or 6.1%, compared to 2014. The net increase in total merchandise sales comparing 2015 to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from new stores opened during 2015, partially offset by decreases in comparable store sales and Direct revenue.\nThe following summarizes the operating results of our three business segments. For a more detailed discussion, see Results of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\u201d.\nRetail segment results for 2015 compared to 2014 were as follows:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>revenue increased $308 million, or 13.1% (adjusted to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014, revenue increased$242 million, or 10.3%);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating income increased $7 million, or 1.7%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating income as a percentage of Retail segment revenue decreased 180 basis points to 16.0%; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>comparable store sales on a consolidated basis decreased 3.4%, and for our United States locations decreased 2.2%, both percentages adjusted to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The stores we opened in 2015 did not meet our sales and profitability expectations so we are slowing new store growth over the next two years as we address retail store performance and productivity. For 2016, we plan to open eight new stores with total retail square footage of approximately 600,000, which is over 7% annual square footage growth compared to the end of 2015.\nIn September 2015, we began operations in our new 600,000 square foot distribution center in Tooele, Utah, which will help to support our growth. In November 2015, we opened a 98,000 square foot distribution center located in Puyallup, Washington, which is near Tacoma, Washington. This leased facility allowed us to eliminate third party warehousing services on the west coast in January 2016 and to timely prioritize in-bound international freight destined for our inland distribution centers and stores, which will increase our internal service levels and deliver our products throughout our network more efficiently. In March 2015, we closed our distribution center in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, as our merchandise needs in Canada are now processed by a third-party logistics provider through a leased facility in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nDirect segment results for 2015 compared to 2014 were as follows:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>revenue decreased $28 million, or 3.3% (adjusted to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014, revenue decreased$45 million, or 5.3%);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating income decreased $30 million, or 26.4%; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating income as a percentage of Direct segment revenue decreased 310 basis points to 10.1%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cabela's CLUB continues to manage credit card delinquencies and charge-offs below industry average by adhering to our conservative underwriting criteria and active account management.

Central to Vision 2020 is our Game Plan for Growth.\u201d We see the potential to continue taking market share in the fragmented outdoor market, while growing organically through customer loyalty and by providing rich customer experiences in every business channel. By embracing the diverse nature of the outdoor marketplace, and regional preferences, we will be able to capitalize on the best of both traditions and trends in outfitting our customers. This means bringing customers quality products that allow them to enjoy the outdoor traditions that bring them closer to nature, and family and friends - while meeting their expectations for great values and the latest products that make their outdoors pursuits more productive and enjoyable.\nThe Game Plan for Growth is defined by two strategies: Focus on the Core and Foremost Advantage.\nFocus on the Core - Focus on the Core will concentrate investment and resources to the categories customers most identify with Cabela's, and where customers demand the most from us in product selection, availability, and expertise - Hunting, Fishing, Camping, and Shooting Sports.\nForemost Advantage - Based on our heritage as the World's Foremost Outfitter, the Foremost Advantage aligns business strategies to a framework developed with over 50 years of deep customer insights. This framework will drive revenue and shareholder returns by focusing on our customers and is defined by four areas: Experience, Expertise, Excellent Value and Exceptional Products.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Experience - Engaging customers with rich, relevant experiences in every channel to drive a cycle of repeat visits and sales growth.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expertise - Proving to customers that we are the foremost outdoor experts in the retail industry by offering end-use knowledge and experience that is trusted above all others.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Excellent Value - Winning customer loyalty and increasing customer purchases with the value propositions we create.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Exceptional Products - Offering products that meet customer demands in quality and performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Strategic Focus Areas\nVision 2020 and the Growth Game Plan are anchored by six strategic focus areas that will ensure winning results by defining measurable objectives and aligning strategies across the enterprise:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Improve Top-Line Sales\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase Bottom-Line Profits\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Retail Store Expansion and Innovation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Customers First\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Focus on All Outfitters\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Grow the CLUB\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Improve Top-Line Sales - We believe smarter assortments and better floor space utilization will continue improving retail comparable store sales. Our retail merchandise performance will also be supported by focusing on the core categories of our business, while delivering top national brands, excellent values, and exceptional products for our customers. Our Direct business is poised to continue making improvements to the omni-channel customer experience and support total sales by investments in revenue-driving digital programs that support wins across both the Retail and Direct businesses.\nIncrease Bottom-Line Profits - Our leadership is focused on driving rigor into the business to rapidly advance business maturity, while committing to a continuous improvement culture and earning the right to be a test and learn company. We are also aggressively transforming our business by adopting leading practices to drive revenue, leverage expenses, gain competitive advantage, and increase profitability in all business units.\nRetail Store Expansion and Innovation - We believe it is imperative to continue innovating how we select, design, and build our retail stores, while applying best-in-class omni-channel retail practices to improve customer experience and reduce expenses from groundbreaking to grand opening. Ongoing efforts are using learnings from our legacy in destination retail, our extensive internal customer analytics capabilities, and relationships with external partners and industry leaders to triangulate solutions that will satisfy customers and shareholders.\nCustomers First - Our founders believed customer service was the centerpiece of every Cabela's experience. We have pro-staff programs connecting influential industry leaders and local experts with Cabela's customers in our retail stores. Our hunters' education programs are proactively working to reduce a national shortage of hunters' education instructors with a grassroots effort centered in our stores and led by our outfitters. We are also partnering with top brands to increase sales by providing more customer service and expertise in retail stores, without increasing expenses. We have made it easier and simpler than ever before for customers to complete an order online on any device, check inventory availability at their local stores, and connect to Cabela's on all types of social media. Multiple channel order delivery capabilities also allow us to optimize delivery expectations for customers while minimizing transportation costs. We have the capability to deliver distribution center to customer, retail store to customer, vendor to customer, in-store-pickup from retail store inventory, and in-store-pickup from distribution center inventory.\nFocus on All Outfitters - Promoting diversity across the business, and building an employee base of outfitters that hails from across the country is a key component of Vision 2020. Our leadership believes in embracing people of all backgrounds and viewpoints, because there is greater value in multiple perspectives and varied experiences. We call all our employees outfitters\u201d for good reason. Every outfitter that interacts with a customer needs outdoor expertise, whether they are working at a cash register or building a webpage. This makes providing opportunities for outfitters to enjoy the outdoor lifestyle a priority. We accomplish this through work-life balance, discount programs, and opportunities to learn first-hand about core outdoor pursuits.\nGrow the CLUB - We must continue to foster and promote the close relationship between the merchandising business and Cabela's CLUB. Our efforts lead to perennial increases in cardholders through organic growth and retail store expansion in the United States. This close partnership between the merchandising business and Cabela's CLUB also allows our tiered loyalty programs to increase average balances of credit card loans and total credit card loans outstanding on an annual basis.\nCurrent Business Environment\nMacroeconomic Environment - In 2015, we experienced a challenging consumer environment across all business channels. To address these issues, we increased our promotional activity, adjusted our marketing spending, and implemented operating expense controls to levels consistent with how our business was performing. In addition, during the last half of 2015, we launched a major multi-year corporate restructuring project aimed at lowering the Company's operating expenses. The Financial Services segment continues to monitor developments in the securitization and certificates of deposit markets to ensure adequate access to liquidity. We expect our charge-off rates and delinquency levels to remain below industry averages.\nDevelopments in Legislation and Regulation - Since the latter part of 2012, there has been significant discussion regarding enacted gun control legislation and potential gun control legislation, primarily aimed at modern sporting rifles, certain semiautomatic pistols, and high capacity magazines. For example, the States of Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, and New York have enacted legislation that prohibits the sale of certain high capacity magazines and, in some cases, the sale of certain firearms. We do not expect this state legislation to have a significant impact on our business. We are a federally licensed firearm dealer that conducts required background checks on prospective firearms purchasers. As such, we do not expect the executive action announced in January 2016 regarding background checks for all purchases of firearms to have a significant impact on our business. Any new federal legislation that prohibits the sale of certain modern sporting rifles, semiautomatic pistols, or ammunition could negatively impact our hunting equipment sales.\nPursuant to certain liquidity requirements under the interim final rules and the joint final rules implemented under the regulatory capital reforms recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (referred to as Basel III\u201d), the noteholders under two of the variable funding facilities issued under WFB's securitization program have requested and obtained amendments to their respective transaction documents. In one case, the amendments permit the noteholders to delay funding an advance requested under that facility for up to 35 days. In the other case, the amendments require WFB to provide 35 days' prior notice in connection with requests for certain advances. These changes and any similar changes requested by the noteholders under any other variable funding facility could delay or disrupt access to funding under the variable funding facilities. Moreover, the liquidity requirements under Basel III could result in an increase in the borrowing costs under the variable funding facilities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act\u201d) was signed into law in July 2010 and has made extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and credit rating agencies and requires significant rule-making. The changes resulting from the Reform Act may impact our profitability, require changes to certain Financial Services segment business practices, impose upon the Financial Services segment more stringent capital, liquidity, and leverage ratio requirements, increase the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's ( FDIC\u201d) deposit insurance premiums, or otherwise adversely affect the Financial Services segment's business. These changes may also require the Financial Services segment to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes.\nThe Reform Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the Bureau\u201d) within the Federal Reserve, a new federal consumer protection regulator. The Bureau has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings, and payment services and products, and WFB is subject to its regulation. While the Bureau does not currently examine WFB, it receives information from the FDIC, WFB's primary regulator. The Bureau also has rulemaking and interpretive authority under existing and future consumer financial services laws. The Bureau is specifically authorized to issue rules identifying as unlawful acts or practices it defines as unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices\u201d in connection with a consumer or in connection with a consumer financial product or service.\nThe Bureau, the FDIC, and other agencies have recently announced several high-profile enforcement actions against credit card issuers for deceptive marketing and other illegal practices related to the advertising of ancillary products, collection practices, and other matters. By these recent public enforcement actions, the Bureau and the FDIC have signaled a heightened scrutiny of credit card issuers. Across the industry, we anticipate increased activity by regulators in pursuing consumer protection claims going forward.\nSeveral rules and regulations have been proposed or adopted that may substantially affect issuers of asset-backed securities. On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) approved joint final regulations implementing the provisions of the Reform Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule.\u201d Generally, the Volcker Rule and the implementing regulations prohibit any banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund, subject to exemptions for certain permitted activities. These regulations limit our ability to engage in the types of transactions covered by the Volcker Rule, and may impose compliance, monitoring, and reporting obligations on us and WFB under certain circumstances. Although the effective date of the regulations is April 1, 2014, the Federal Reserve approved an extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2016, and has announced its intention to further extend the conformance period until July 21, 2017. We are continuing to assess the impact, if any, that the Volcker Rule and the implementing regulation will have on our Retail, Direct, and Financial Services segments, but we do not expect the Volcker Rule to have a material impact on WFB's securitization program.\nThe Cabela's Master Credit Card Trust and related entities (collectively referred to as the Trust\u201d) is structured to qualify for the exemption from the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act\u201d) provided by Investment Company Act Rule 3a-7. On August 31, 2011, the SEC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible amendments to Investment Company Act Rule 3a-7. At this time, it is uncertain what form the related proposed and final rules will take, whether the Trust would continue to be eligible to rely on the exemption provided by Investment Company Act Rule 3a-7, and whether the Trust would qualify for any other Investment Company Act exemption.\nOn August 27, 2014, the SEC adopted certain rules ( SEC Regulation AB II\u201d) that will change the disclosure, reporting, and offering process for public offerings of asset-backed securities, including those issued under WFB's securitization program. SEC Regulation AB II had been originally proposed by the SEC on April 7, 2010, and was reproposed by the SEC on July 26, 2011. Among other things, SEC Regulation AB II imposes as a condition for the shelf registration of asset-backed securities the filing of a certification concerning the disclosure contained in the prospectus and the design of the securitization at the time of each offering off the shelf and the appointment of a credit risk manager to review assets when credit enhancement requirements are not met or at the direction of investors. As originally proposed and re-proposed, SEC Regulation AB II would have required the disclosure of group-level data regarding the receivables in a credit card securitization, but this requirement was not included in the final rule as adopted. There can be no assurances that the SEC will not require disclosure of group-level data in credit card securitizations in the future. We are continuing to assess the impact of SEC Regulation AB II on WFB's securitization program.\nOn October 22, 2014, pursuant to the provisions of the Reform Act, the FDIC, the SEC, the Federal Reserve, and certain other federal agencies adopted regulations that impose a five percent risk retention requirement for credit card securitizations that are issued after December 2016. We have not determined whether WFB's existing forms of risk retention will satisfy the regulatory requirements, whether structural changes will be necessary, or whether the risk retention requirement will impact the Financial Services segment's ability or desire to continue to rely on the securitization market for funding.\nOn September 19, 2011, the SEC proposed a new rule under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to implement certain provisions of the Reform Act. Under the proposed rule, an underwriter, placement agent, initial purchaser, or sponsor of an asset-backed security, or any affiliate of any such person, shall not at any time within one year after the first closing of the sale of the asset-backed security engage in any transaction that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest with respect to any investor in a transaction arising out of such activity. The proposed rule would exempt certain risk mitigating hedging activities, liquidity commitments, and bona fide market-making activity. It is not clear how the final rule will differ from the proposed rule, if at all. The final rule's impact on the securitization market and the Financial Services segment is also unclear at this time.\nOperations Review\nOur operating results expressed as a percentage of revenue were as follows for the years ended:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>57.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>42.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>34.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment and restructuring charges\n</td> <td>0.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>7.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(0.57\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.61\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other income, net\n</td> <td>0.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>(0.33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.47\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>7.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>2.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>4.74\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.53\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues\nRetail revenue includes sales realized and customer services performed at our retail stores, sales from orders placed through our retail store Internet kiosks, and sales from customers utilizing our in-store pick-up program. Direct revenue includes Internet and call center (catalog) sales from orders placed through our website, over the phone, and by mail where the merchandise is shipped through our omni-channel fulfillment process to our customers at locations of their choice. Retail and Direct revenue also includes sales from the redemption of loyalty points earned by Cabela's CLUB Visa cardholders of our Financial Services segment. Financial Services revenue is comprised of interest and fee income, interchange income, other non-interest income, interest expense, provision for loan losses, and customer rewards costs from our credit card operations. Other revenue sources include the value of unredeemed points earned that are associated with the Company's loyalty rewards programs for Cabela's CLUB issued credit cards, net of the estimated costs of the points; fees for hunting and fishing outfitter services; fees from a full-service travel agency business; real estate rental income and land sales; and other complementary business services.\nOur retail stores are included in our distribution network through the omni-channel fulfillment process. Therefore, we ship products to our customers from both our distribution centers and our retail stores, so customers who order through our call centers or website are not solely dependent upon the stock we have in our distribution centers.\nComparisons and analysis of our revenues are presented below for the years ended:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,658,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>823,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,452\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>502,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>13,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,822\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,997,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,647,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Sales Mix - The following table sets forth the percentage of our merchandise revenue contributed by major product categories for our Retail and Direct segments and in total for the years ended:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Direct\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hunting Equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Outdoors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clothing and Footwear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe hunting equipment merchandise category includes a wide variety of firearms, ammunition, optics, archery products, and related accessories and supplies. The general outdoors merchandise category includes a full range of equipment and accessories supporting all outdoor activities, including all types of fishing and tackle products, boats and marine equipment, camping gear and equipment, food preparation and outdoor cooking products, all-terrain vehicles and accessories for automobiles and all-terrain vehicles, and gifts and home furnishings. The clothing and footwear merchandise category includes fieldwear apparel and footwear, sportswear, casual clothing and footwear, and workwear products.\nRetail Revenue - Retail revenue increased $308 million, or 13.1%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase of $321 million in revenue from the addition of new retail stores. The 53rd week in 2015 increased Retail revenue by $66 million; therefore, adjusted for 52 weeks, Retail revenue increased $242 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\nThe increase in retail revenue from new retail stores was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of $75 million. A store is included in our comparable store sales base on the first day of the month following the fifteen month anniversary of 1) its opening or acquisition, or 2) any changes to retail store space greater than 25% of total square footage of the store.\nComparable store sales and analysis are presented below for the years ended:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable stores sales on a consolidated basis\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,093,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,167,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74,729\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable stores sales - United States stores only\n</td> <td>1,984,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,028,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44,243\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable stores sales on a constant currency basis (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes the 53rd week in 2015 to present on a comparable 52-week basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Reflects the elimination of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparable store sales on a consolidated basis decreased $75 million, or 3.4%, compared to 2014. Comparable store sales results for our stores in the United States, which exclude Canada results and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, decreased 2.2% compared to 2014 mostly due to overall decreases in the clothing and footwear product category. The decrease in the clothing and footwear product category was partially offset by an increase of approximately $11 million in the general outdoors and hunting equipment product categories with neither of these two categories disproportionately impacting the year over year change more than the other category.\nWe have seen continued softness in our apparel categories as our fall and winter assortments were met with unseasonably warm weather across most of our major markets. The decrease in comparable store sales comparing 2015 to 2014 was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 6.2% partially offset by an increase in the average sales per transaction of 4.4%. To respond to the softness of sales in our apparel and footwear categories, we have taken a number of actions. We have tested national brand shops in a number of stores, and the results indicate no gross margin rate loss versus our base stores, greater productivity in sales per square foot, and higher penetration of casual apparel sales versus the base. We plan to increase the store count in this test in 2016. We also will be testing alternate labor strategies in our apparel areas to provide better sales coverage during peak selling times. Lastly, our plan for 2016 assumes a greater focus on everyday value in the better\u201d part of our assortment.\nAverage sales per square foot for stores that were open during the entire year were $344 for 2015 compared to $348 for 2014. Our new format stores continue to generate an increase in sales per square foot compared to our legacy stores. However, the stores we opened in 2015 did not meet our sales and profitability expectations and, as a result, we intend to slow new store growth over the next two years as we address retail store performance and productivity. Currently, we are analyzing our store model to assess store level performance and productivity including sales per square foot, store operating contribution margin, store cash flow, construction costs within a store, allocation of space within a store, brand assortment between national brands and Cabela's brand, and customer experience within a store. Our goal is to have a store model that is more predictable in order to maximize sales, margins, cash flows, and an acceptable return on invested capital. We plan to open eight new stores in 2016 with total retail square footage of approximately 600,000, which is over 7% annual square footage growth compared to the end of 2015.\nIn addition, our Cabela's branded products continue to be a core focus for us, as we saw growth of over 1% in Cabela's branded product categories in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2015, our Cabela's branded merchandise accounted for approximately 24% of total merchandise revenue compared to approximately 26% in 2014.\nWe recognize revenue as gift certificates and gift cards ( gift instruments\u201d) are redeemed for merchandise or services. We record gift instrument breakage as Retail revenue when the probability of redemption is remote. Gift instrument breakage recognized was $10 million and $9 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our gift instrument liability at the end of 2015 and 2014 was $184 million and $175 million, respectively.\nDirect Revenue - Direct revenue decreased $28 million, or 3.3%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The 53rd week in 2015 increased Direct revenue by $17 million; therefore, adjusted for 52 weeks, Direct revenue decreased $45 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in Direct revenue was due to decreases in each of our three major product categories comparing the respective years attributable to decreases in the\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>clothing and footwear product category of approximately 51%,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>hunting equipment product category of approximately 37%, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>general outdoors product category of approximately 12%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> A significant factor in the decrease in our clothing and footwear product category was the negative impact that the unseasonably warm weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 had on sales of fall and winter apparel and footwear. The decrease in the hunting equipment product category was due mostly to a shift in ammunition sales from the Direct segment to the Retail segment.\nInternet sales increased slightly in 2015 (53 weeks) compared to 2014 (52 weeks). The number of visitors to our website increased 15% in 2015 compared to a decrease of 8% in 2014 as we saw a return to normalized traffic after the surge in sales of ammunition in 2013 and the subsequent decrease in 2014. We intend to expand our drop-ship sales program through our high traffic website, which will increase the exposure of national brands, provide low risk expansion of product lines, and provide faster distribution of products.\nFinancial Services Revenue - The following table sets forth the components of Financial Services revenue for the years ended: Table 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fee income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>481,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(68,827\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>(85,120\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61,922\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net interest income, net of provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>327,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>274,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interchange income\n</td> <td>394,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>366,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other non-interest income\n</td> <td>2,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>397,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>369,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Customer rewards costs\n</td> <td>(222,268\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(214,445\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>502,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>430,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Services revenue increased $72 million, or 16.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014.

We define an active credit card account as any account with an outstanding debit or credit balance at the end of any respective month. The average number of active accounts increased to 1.9 million, or 6.8%, compared to 2014 due to our successful marketing efforts in new account acquisitions. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased to 1.70% for 2015, up one basis point compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in loan delinquencies and a decrease in payment rates, partially offset by improvements in recovery rates. Recovery rates were positively impacted in 2015 due to a bulk sale of bankruptcy loans and acceleration of the timing of a sale of charged-off loans, which resulted in an 11 basis point reduction in the charge-off rate.\nSee Asset Quality of Cabela's CLUB\u201d in this report for additional information on trends in delinquencies and non-accrual loans and analysis of our allowance for loan losses.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue decreased $2 million in 2015 to $13 million compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales revenue in 2015 compared to 2014.\nMerchandise Gross Profit\nMerchandise gross profit is defined as merchandise sales, including shipping fees charged to customers, less the costs of related merchandise sold and shipping costs.

SD&A expenses increased primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas and a $14 million increase in incentive compensation in 2015. We did not incur any incentive compensation expense in 2014. In 2015, we incurred a $6 million charge for severance and related benefits (which was included in impairment and restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of income) due to a corporate office restructure and reduction in the number of personnel. In addition to this reduction in the number of corporate personnel, we continue to focus on expense management throughout the Company pursuant to a major multi-year corporate restructuring project aimed at lowering the Company's operating expense base. In 2015, we identified several expense reduction opportunities that we have implemented or are in the process of implementing that should benefit operating income in upcoming periods. The goal of this restructuring project is to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue by 75 to 150 basis points over the next three years.\nThe most significant factors contributing to the changes in SD&A expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 included:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of $94 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas, which increase also includes a $14 million increase in incentive compensation in 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of $32 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and to the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores as well as corporate offices.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant changes in our consolidated SD&A expenses related to specific business segments included:\nRetail Segment:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An increase of $43 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to the opening of new retail stores.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An increase of $27 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and to the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDirect Segment:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A decrease of $1 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor in part related to our emphasis on operating expense management.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Services Segment:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An increase of $9 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor to support the growth of credit card operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Overhead, Distribution Centers, and Other:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An increase of $43 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to costs in related support areas, which increase also includes a $14 million increase in incentive compensation in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An increase of $5 million in building costs primarily related to the operations and maintenance of our corporate office to support operational growth.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Impairment and Restructuring Charges\nImpairment and restructuring charges consisted of the following for the years ended:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment losses relating to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property, equipment, and other assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other property\n</td> <td>5,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>9,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges for severance and related benefits\n</td> <td>5,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>641\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>641\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment - Long-lived assets are evaluated for possible impairment (i) whenever changes in circumstances may indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and (ii) at least annually for recurring fair value measurements and for those assets not subject to amortization. In 2015 and 2014, we evaluated the recoverability of economic development bonds, property (including existing store locations and future retail store sites), equipment, goodwill, other property, and other intangible assets. We intend to sell our other property as soon as any such sale could be economically feasible, and we continue to monitor such property for impairment.\nIn 2015, we recognized an impairment loss of $4 million relating to the write-off of costs pertaining to store sites we had previously identified as future retail store locations but in 2015 decided not to develop based on the Company's plans to scale back retail store expansion for 2016 and 2017. This impairment was recorded in the Retail segment. Also in 2015, an impairment loss totaling $6 million was recognized on three separate parcels of land. The fair value on two parcels of land were based on appraisals and the fair value on the third parcel of land was based on discounted cash flow projection estimates (Level 3 inputs). This impairment loss was recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment. We did not recognize any impairment during 2014.\nLocal economic trends, government regulations, and other restrictions where we own properties may impact management projections that could change undiscounted cash flows in future periods and which could trigger possible future write downs.\nRestructuring Charges - In 2015, we incurred charges totaling $6 million for severance and related benefits due to a corporate office restructure and reduction in the number of personnel. The liability for severance benefits was included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and will be reduced as payments are disbursed, which will be substantially completed over the next 12 months. The charges were recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment.\nIn June 2014, we announced the transition to a third-party logistics provider for our distribution needs in Canada and the closing of our distribution center in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Accordingly, in 2014, we recognized a restructuring charge related to employee severance agreements and termination benefits totaling approximately $1 million. This restructuring charge was recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income is revenue less cost of revenue; selling, distribution, and administrative expenses; and impairment and restructuring charges.

The decreases in total operating income and total operating income as a percentage of total revenue were primarily due to increases in consolidated operating expenses and impairment and restructuring charges and a decrease in revenue from our Direct segment. These decreases to operating income were partially offset by increases in revenue from our Retail and Financial Services segments and an increase in our merchandise gross profit. Operating expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas, and due to an increase in incentive compensation in 2015 as we did not incur any incentive compensation expense in 2014. We are focusing on expense management throughout the Company and have implemented many expense reduction efforts that should continue to benefit operating income in upcoming periods. We plan to continue our retail expansion, our omni-channel initiatives, and our Cabela's branded product investments as we focus on expense management controls consistent with our multi-year corporate restructuring project.\nUnder an Intercompany Agreement, the Financial Services segment pays to the Retail and Direct business segments a fixed license fee that includes 70 basis points on all originated charge volume of the Cabela's CLUB Visa credit card portfolio. In addition, among other items, the agreement requires the Financial Services segment to reimburse the Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs, which are recorded as a reduction to Financial Services segment revenue and as a reduction to merchandise costs associated with the Retail and Direct segments. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, this reimbursement from our Financial Services segment to our Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs has been adjusted to eliminate in consolidation. Periods prior to the second quarter of 2014 have not been adjusted.\nAlso, if the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB is greater than 13% at any quarter end, the Financial Services segment must pay an additional license fee to the Retail and Direct business segments equal to 50% of the amount that the total risk-based capital ratio exceeds 13%. At December 31, 2015, and the end of each calendar quarter in 2015, the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB did not exceed this 13% threshold, so no additional license fee was paid. At March 31, 2014, the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB exceeded 13%. Therefore, in accordance with our Intercompany Agreement, an additional license fee of $11 million was paid in April 2014 by the Financial Services segment to the Retail segment ($7 million) and Direct segment ($4 million) and was classified in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses. Comparing the changes in operating income as a percentage of segment revenue in 2015 to 2014, this additional license fee payment of $11 million to our segments accounted for:\n\u20220.3% of the 1.8% decrease for the Retail segment,\n\u20220.5% of the 3.1% decrease for the Direct segment, and\n\u20222.6% of the 9.0% increase for the Financial Services segment.\nTotal fees paid under the Intercompany Agreement by the Financial Services segment to these two segments, including the $11 million payment in 2014 triggered by the excess total risk-based capital ratio provision, increased $2 million in 2015 compared to 2014; a $13 million increase to the Retail segment and an $11 million decrease to the Direct segment.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, was $23 million and $22 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We incur interest expense on our revolving credit facilities, our long-term debt, and on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits. The amount of interest capitalized increased to $10 million in 2015 compared to $8 million in 2014 primarily due to our new corporate facility and the distribution center in Tooele, Utah. However, this increase in the amount of interest capitalized comparing the respective years was partially offset due to additional interest expense recognized in 2015 associated with our uncertain tax positions, the issuances of the new unsecured notes for $250 million in August 2015 and $300 million in December 2015, and higher outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOther Non-Operating Income, Net\nOther non-operating income was $10 million in 2015 compared to $5 million in 2014. This income is primarily from interest earned on our economic development bonds.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 35.7% in 2015 compared to 36.7% in 2014. The decrease in our effective tax rate comparing the respective years was primarily due to a decrease in our effective tax rate related to tax adjustments attributable to changes in the mix of taxable income between the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions and completion of a retroactive research and development tax credit study during 2015. These decreases in our effective tax rate were partially offset by increases in unrecognized tax benefits and a deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to Canada taxable net operating losses.\nThe balance of unrecognized tax benefits totaled $73 million at January 2, 2016, and was classified in long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, compared to a total of $102 million at December 27, 2014, with $46 million classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities and $56 million in long-term liabilities.\nResults of Operations -

Retail revenue increased $117 million, or 5.3%, in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase of $376 million in revenue from the addition of new retail stores. The increase in retail revenue from new retail stores was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of $255 million.\nComparable store sales and analysis are presented below for the years ended:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable stores sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,815,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,070,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(255,043\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable stores sales increase (decrease) percentage\n</td> <td>(12.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in comparable store sales comparing 2014 to 2013 was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 12.2% and in average sales per transaction of 0.1%. In addition, the $255 million decrease in comparable store sales was across all major product categories comparing 2014 to 2013, and was attributable to decreases in the\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>hunting equipment product category of approximately 76%,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>general outdoors product category of approximately 11%, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>clothing and footwear product category of approximately 13%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs noted in the preceding paragraph, most of the decrease in comparable store sales was due to a decrease in the hunting equipment product category, with 87% of such decrease primarily due to a decrease in sales of firearms and ammunition, as consumer demand for firearms and ammunition was significantly greater in 2013 compared to 2014. We believed that the decreases in sales of firearms and ammunition had begun to level out in 2014, and we expected sales of firearms and ammunition to return to more normalized levels in fiscal 2015. Gift instrument breakage recognized was $9 million and $7 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Average sales per square foot for stores that were open during the entire year were $348 for 2014 compared to $385 for 2013 due to the reasons discussed above. However, our new format retail stores continued to perform better on a sales per square foot basis than our legacy stores.\nDirect Revenue - Direct revenue decreased $122 million, or 12.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013. This $122 million decrease in Direct revenue was across all major product categories and was attributable to decreases in the\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>hunting equipment product category of approximately 72%,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>general outdoors product category of approximately 8%, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>clothing and footwear product category of approximately 20%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs noted above, most of the decrease in Direct revenue was due to a decrease in the hunting equipment product category with 82% of such decrease primarily due to a decrease in sales of ammunition and other shooting related products compared to 2013. Although we are not able to specifically quantify the impact, we believe that our Direct revenue also decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 from expected cannibalization due to our customers shopping at new Cabela's retail store locations.\nInternet sales decreased in 2014 compared to 2013. The number of visitors to our website decreased 8% in 2014 after experiencing record growth of nearly 26% in 2013 due to the surge in sales of ammunition. Our website traffic was also negatively effected by the expected cannibalization from our new retail store growth. Our hunting equipment and general outdoors categories were the largest dollar volume contributors to our Direct revenue for 2014. The number of active Direct customers, which we define as those customers who have purchased merchandise from us in the last twelve months, remained relatively even compared to 2013.\nWe continued to focus on smaller, more specialized catalogs, and we reduced the number of pages mailed and decreased total circulation, leading to continued reductions in catalog related costs. Increases in website and mobile platform related expenses due to our expanded use of digital marketing channels and enhancements to our website mostly offset the reductions in catalog related costs.\nFinancial Services Revenue - The following table sets forth the components of our Financial Services revenue for the years ended:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fee income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(64,167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63,831\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>(61,922\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,223\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net interest income, net of provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>274,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interchange income\n</td> <td>366,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other non-interest income\n</td> <td>3,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>369,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>352,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Customer rewards costs\n</td> <td>(214,445\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(212,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>430,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>375,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Services revenue increased $55 million, or 14.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in interest and fee income of $58 million was due to increases in credit card loans and the mix of credit card loans carrying interest, partially offset by lower rates in LIBOR. The provision for loan losses increased $19 million primarily due to growth in the average outstanding balance of credit card loans in 2014 compared to 2013. In addition, the provision for loan losses in 2013 was lower, in part, due to declining balances in our restructured loan portfolio, improvements in historical charge-off trends, and other performance data in this portfolio. The increase in interchange income of $22 million was primarily due to an increase in credit card purchases, partially offset by a decrease in the interchange rate. The decrease in other non-interest income was a result of the discontinuance of an identity theft program in 2013. The increase in credit card purchases also increased customer rewards costs, with such increase in 2014 compared to 2013 offset by the adjustment in the presentation of reimbursements between segments for certain promotional costs totaling $15 million for 2014. The impact of this reimbursement adjustment resulted in an increase in Financial Services revenue and an increase in merchandise cost of sales by the same amount.

The dollar amount of unredeemed credit card points and loyalty points was $165 million at the end of 2014 compared to $146 million at the end of 2013.\nKey statistics reflecting the performance of Cabela's CLUB are shown in the following table for the years ended:\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands Except Average Balance per Active Account)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average balance of credit card loans (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,937,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,500,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>436,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average number of active credit card accounts\n</td> <td>1,817,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,688,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average balance per active credit card account (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs on credit card loans (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans (1)\n</td> <td>1.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes accrued interest and fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The average balance of credit card loans increased to $3.9 billion, or 12.5%, for 2014 compared to 2013 due to increases in the number of active accounts and the average balance per account. We define an active credit card account as any account with an outstanding debit or credit balance at the end of any respective month during the past 12 months. The average number of active accounts increased to 1.8 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2013 due to our successful marketing efforts in new account acquisitions. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans decreased to 1.69% for 2014, down 11 basis points compared to 2013, due to improvements in the quality of our credit card portfolio evidenced by continued low delinquencies, an increase in recovery rates, and declining loan balances in our restructured loan portfolio.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue decreased $2 million in 2014 to $15 million compared to 2013 primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales revenue in 2014 compared to 2013.\nMerchandise Gross Profit\nComparisons and analysis of our gross profit on merchandising revenue are presented below for the years ended:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchandise sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,200,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,205,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,413\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchandise gross profit\n</td> <td>1,141,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,178,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37,112\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales\n</td> <td>35.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur merchandise gross profit decreased $37 million, or 3.1%, to $1.1 billion in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a decrease in sales of firearms and ammunition in 2014 compared to 2013.\nOur merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales decreased 110 basis points to 35.7% in 2014 from 36.8% in 2013. The decrease in the merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased sales discounts and markdowns, which had an impact of approximately 70 basis points, and to an adjustment in the presentation of reimbursement between segments for certain promotional costs totaling $15 million for 2014, which had an impact of approximately 50 basis points. The effect of this reimbursement adjustment resulted in an increase in Financial Services revenue and an increase in merchandise cost of sales by the same amount. This presentation will be ongoing and had no impact on consolidated operating income or earnings per diluted share.\nSelling, Distribution, and Administrative Expenses\nComparisons and analysis of our selling, distribution, and administrative expenses were as follows for the years ended: Table 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SD&A expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,251,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,201,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SD&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail store pre-opening costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, distribution, and administrative expenses increased $50 million, or 4.1%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses increased primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas. We focused on expense management throughout the Company and implemented many expense reduction efforts that have shown benefits in 2014 and should continue to benefit operating income in upcoming periods. The most significant factors contributing to the changes in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 included:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of $38 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and to the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores as well as corporate offices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of $22 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation and our emphasis on operating expense management;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of $20 million in advertising and promotional costs as we initiated our promotional activity earlier in the fourth quarter of 2014 in an effort to increase sales and to address pricing of competitors;

The third-party logistics provider began processing a portion of our Canada merchandise in a Calgary, Alberta, distribution center in October 2014. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2014 the Company recognized a restructuring charge related to employee severance agreements and termination benefits totaling approximately $1 million. This restructuring charge was recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment. We expected to incur approximately $2 million in additional incremental expenses related to the transition to this third-party logistics provider and the closing of our current distribution center in the first half of fiscal 2015.\nOn February 4, 2014, a United States district court (the Court\u201d) entered a judgment against the Company in the amount of $14 million relating to litigation regarding a breach of a retail store radius restriction. At December 28, 2013, pursuant to this judgment, we recognized a liability of $14 million, including an estimated amount for legal fees and costs, in our consolidated balance sheet. The recognition of this liability at December 28, 2013, resulted in the Company recording an increase to the carrying amount of the related retail store property through a reduction in deferred grant income by the amount repayable, plus legal and other costs. The cumulative additional depreciation that would have been recognized through December 28, 2013, as an expense in the absence of these grants was recognized in 2013 as depreciation expense. Therefore, the adjustment that reduced the deferred grant income of this retail store property at December 28, 2013, resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of $5 million in 2013, which was included in impairment and restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of income. This impairment loss was recognized in the Retail segment.\nOn March 21, 2014, through a supplemental judgment, the Court ordered that we pay interest in the amount of $1 million to the defendant. Therefore, our liability relating to this judgment increased in the first quarter of 2014 resulting in the Company recording an increase to the carrying amount of the related retail store property through a reduction in deferred grant income. The additional depreciation adjustment that reduced the deferred grant income of this retail store property resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $1 million that was recognized in the three months ended March 29, 2014. This increase in depreciation expense was included in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and was recognized in the Retail segment. There was no additional depreciation expense adjustment recognized after March 29, 2014. At December 27, 2014, this liability totaled $16 million.\nWe recognized an impairment loss totaling $1 million in 2013 related to the store closure of our former Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, retail site. The impairment loss of $1 million included leasehold improvement write-offs as well as lease cancellation and restoration costs. This impairment loss was recognized in the Retail and the Corporate Overhead and Other segments.\nOperating Income\nComparisons and analysis of operating income are presented below for the years ended:\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,966\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income by business segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,706\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>112,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44,510\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>111,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percentage of segment revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income decreased $26 million, or 7.2%, in 2014 compared to 2013, and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased 80 basis points to 9.2% for 2014. The decreases in total operating income and total operating income as a percentage of total revenue were primarily due to an increase in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses, a decrease in revenue from our Direct business segment, and a decrease in our merchandise gross profit. These decreases to operating income were partially offset by increased operating income contributions from our Financial Services segment. Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas.\nUnder an Intercompany Agreement, the Financial Services segment pays to the Retail and Direct business segments a fixed license fee that includes 70 basis points on all originated charge volume of the Cabela's CLUB Visa credit card portfolio. In addition, among other items, the agreement requires the Financial Services segment to reimburse the Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs, which are recorded as a reduction to Financial Services segment revenue and as a reduction to merchandise costs associated with the Retail and Direct segments. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, this reimbursement from our Financial Services segment to our Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs has been adjusted to eliminate in consolidation. Prior periods have not been adjusted. Also, if the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB is greater than 13% at any quarter end, the Financial Services segment must pay an additional license fee to the Retail and Direct business segments equal to 50% of the amount that the total risk-based capital ratio exceeds 13%. At March 31, 2014, the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB exceeded this 13% threshold; therefore, an additional license fee of $11 million was paid in April 2014 by the Financial Services segment to the Retail segment ($7 million) and the Direct segment ($4 million). Total fees paid under the Intercompany Agreement by the Financial Services segment to these two segments, including the $11 million payment triggered by the excess total risk-based capital ratio provision, increased $20 million in 2014 compared to 2013; a $24 million increase to the Retail segment and a $4 million decrease to the Direct segment.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, was $22 million in both 2014 and 2013. The amount of interest capitalized increased to $8 million in 2014 compared to $4 million in 2013 primarily due to more stores opened. However, the increase in the amount of interest capitalized comparing the respective years was offset by additional interest expense recognized in 2014 associated with our uncertain tax positions and increases in interest expense due to higher outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility.\nOther Non-Operating Income, Net\nOther non-operating income was $5 million in 2014 compared to $4 million in 2013. This income is primarily from interest earned on our economic development bonds.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 36.7% in 2014 compared to 34.7% in 2013. The increase in our effective tax rate comparing the respective fiscal years is due to an increase of $4 million in accrued income tax related to tax adjustments attributable to changes in the mix of prior year taxable income between the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions and an increase in our state effective tax rate.\nAsset Quality of Cabela's CLUB\nDelinquencies and Non-Accrual\nWe consider the entire balance of an account, including any accrued interest and fees, delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date. Our aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which a customer has failed to make a required payment. As part of collection efforts, a credit card loan may be closed and placed on non-accrual or restructured in a fixed payment plan prior to charge-off. Our fixed payment plans require payment of the loan within 60 months and consist of a lower interest rate, reduced minimum payment, and elimination of fees. Loans on fixed payment plans include loans in which the customer has engaged a consumer credit counseling agency to assist them in managing their debt. Customers who miss two consecutive payments once placed on a payment plan or non-accrual will resume accruing interest at the rate they had accrued at before they were placed on a plan. Interest and fees are accrued in accordance with the terms of the applicable cardholder agreements or payment plan on credit card loans until the date of charge-off unless placed on non-accrual. Payments received on non-accrual loans are applied to principal and reduce the amount of the loan.\nThe quality of our credit card loan portfolio at any time reflects, among other factors: 1) the creditworthiness of cardholders, 2) general economic conditions, 3) the success of our account management and collection activities, and 4) the life-cycle stage of the portfolio. During periods of economic weakness, delinquencies and net charge-offs are more likely to increase. We have mitigated periods of economic weakness by selecting a customer base that is very creditworthy. We use the scores of Fair Isaac Corporation ( FICO\u201d), a widely-used financial metric for assessing an individual's credit rating, as the primary credit quality indicator. The median FICO score of our credit cardholders was 794 at the end of 2015 and 795 at the end of 2014.\nThe following table reports delinquencies, including any delinquent non-accrual and restructured credit card loans, as a percentage of our credit card loans, including any accrued interest and fees, in a manner consistent with our monthly external reporting for the years ended:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of days delinquent:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 30 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 60 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 90 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDelinquencies increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due, in part, to generally challenging consumer conditions affecting payment rates as well as certain changes we made in our collection efforts on delinquent accounts.

For information on the accounting policy, estimates, and assumptions relating to our allowance for loan losses on our credit card loan portfolio, please refer to Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d under the section titled Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nCharge-offs consist of the uncollectible principal, interest, and fees on a customer's account. Recoveries are the amounts collected on previously charged-off accounts, including such accounts that are sold to a third party. Most bankcard issuers charge off accounts at 180 days. We charge off credit card loans on a daily basis after an account becomes at a minimum 130 days contractually delinquent to allow us to manage the collection process more efficiently. Accounts relating to cardholder bankruptcies, cardholder deaths, and fraudulent transactions are charged off earlier.\nThe following table shows the activity in our allowance for loan losses and charge-off activity for the years ended:\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>85,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs\n</td> <td>(91,196\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76,868\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72,959\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoveries\n</td> <td>25,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs\n</td> <td>(65,781\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58,460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs on credit card loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(65,781\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58,460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs of accrued interest and fees (recorded as a reduction in interest and fee income)\n</td> <td>(10,065\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,093\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net charge-offs including accrued interest and fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(75,846\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66,553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63,152\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs, including accrued interest and fees, as a percentage of average credit card loans, including accrued interest and fees\n</td> <td>1.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased to 1.70% for 2015, up one basis point compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in loan delinquencies and a decrease in payment rates, partially offset by improvements in recovery rates. Recovery rates were positively impacted in 2015 due to a bulk sale of bankruptcy loans and acceleration of the timing of a sale of charged-off loans, which resulted in an 11 basis point reduction in the charge-off rate.\nAging of Credit Cards Loans Outstanding\nThe following table shows our credit card loans outstanding at the end of 2015 and 2014 segregated by the number of months passed since the accounts were opened.\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Loans Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loans Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Months Since Account Opened\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6 months or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7 - 12 months\n</td> <td>189,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>13 - 24 months\n</td> <td>428,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>410,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 - 36 months\n</td> <td>464,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>37 - 48 months\n</td> <td>397,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>342,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>49 - 60 months\n</td> <td>363,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>61 - 72 months\n</td> <td>297,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>294,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>73 - 84 months\n</td> <td>308,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>More than 84 months\n</td> <td>2,449,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,130,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,104,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,472,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur Retail and Direct segments and our Financial Services segment have significantly differing liquidity and capital needs. We believe that we will have sufficient capital available from cash on hand, our revolving credit facility, and other borrowing sources to fund our cash requirements and near-term growth plans for at least the next 12 months. At the end of 2015 and 2014, cash on a consolidated basis totaled $315 million and $143 million, of which $157 million and $49 million, respectively, was cash at the Financial Services segment which is utilized to meet this segment's liquidity requirements. We evaluate the credit markets for securitizations and certificates of deposit to determine the most cost effective source of funds for the Financial Services segment. During 2015, the Financial Services segment issued certificates of deposit, completed term securitizations, and increased its variable funding facility. In 2016, the Financial Services segment intends to issue additional certificates of deposit and term securitizations. We believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund the Financial Services segment's foreseeable cash requirements, including maturities, and near-term growth plans.\nAs of January 2, 2016, cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $97 million. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the United States for capital expansion. The Company has not provided United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that the Company considers to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States as of the end of year 2015. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related United States tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of the year ended 2015, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $191 million. If those earnings were not considered indefinitely invested, the Company estimates that an additional income tax expense of approximately $44 million would be recorded. Based on our current projected capital needs and the current amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, we do not anticipate incurring any material tax costs beyond our accrued tax position in connection with any repatriation, but we may be required to accrue for unanticipated additional tax costs in the future if our expectations or the amount of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries change.\nRetail and Direct Segments - The primary cash requirements of our merchandising business relate to capital for new retail stores, purchases of inventory, investments in our management information systems and infrastructure, and general working capital needs. We historically have met these requirements with cash generated from our merchandising business operations, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, and by issuing debt and equity securities.\nThe cash flow we generate from our merchandising business is seasonal, with our peak cash requirements for inventory occurring from April through November. While we have consistently generated overall positive annual cash flow from our operating activities, other sources of liquidity are required by our merchandising business during these peak cash use periods. These sources historically have included short-term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to debt markets. While we generally have been able to manage our cash needs during peak periods, if any disruption occurred to our funding sources, or if we underestimated our cash needs, we would be unable to purchase inventory and otherwise conduct our merchandising business to its maximum effectiveness, which could result in reduced revenue and profits.\nOur credit agreement provides for an unsecured $775 million revolving credit facility and permits the issuance of letters of credit up to $75 million and swing line loans up to $30 million. The credit facility may be increased to $800 million subject to certain terms and conditions. The term of the credit facility expires on June 18, 2019. Advances under the credit facility will be used for the Company's general business purposes, including working capital support.\nOur unsecured $775 million revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes contain certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of minimum debt coverage, a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio, and a minimum consolidated net worth standard. In the event that we failed to comply with these covenants, a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable. At January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes. We anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes through at least the next 12 months.\nOn August 4, 2015, we entered into a note purchase agreement with various purchasers allowing us to issue and sell an aggregate of $550 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement to certain accredited investors. On August 4, 2015, we issued and sold under this note purchase agreement $250 million of senior unsecured notes with $100 million principal at 3.23% due August 4, 2020, $122 million principal at 3.70% due August 4, 2022, and $28 million principal at 4.01% due August 4, 2025. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually. On December 2, 2015, we issued and sold an additional $300 million of senior unsecured notes with $128 million principal at 3.82% due December 3, 2022, and $172 million principal at 4.11% due December 3, 2025. We have used the proceeds from this sale for general corporate purposes and intend to repay our existing unsecured notes for $215 million due February 27, 2016.\nWe have an unsecured $20 million Canadian (\"CAD\") revolving credit facility for our operations in Canada. Borrowings are payable on demand with interest payable monthly. The credit facility permits the issuance of letters of credit up to $10 million CAD in the aggregate, which reduce the overall credit limit available under the credit facility.\nIn April 2015, we announced our intent to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in open market transactions through February 2016. We completed the repurchase of our common stock under this authorization in August 2015 at a total cost of $100 million.\nOn September 1, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock over a two-year period. This authorization is in addition to the 2,000,000 share repurchase authorization approved in April 2015 and the standing annual authorization to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from equity-based awards issued under the Company's equity compensation plans. The timing and volume of share repurchases may be executed by the Company on a discretionary basis, or pursuant to trading plans, or other arrangements. Any share repurchase under this program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. This share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any outstanding shares of our common stock, and the program may be limited or terminated at any time. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that we will repurchase. The total amount of share repurchases that the Company can make in a year is limited to 75% of its prior year consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined, pursuant to a covenant requirement of its credit agreement. Under this authorization, we repurchased 1,989,305 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $74 million in 2015.\nFinancial Services Segment - The primary cash requirements of the Financial Services segment relate to the financing of credit card loans. These cash requirements will increase if our credit card originations increase or if our cardholders' balances or spending increase. The Financial Services segment sources operating funds in the ordinary course of business through various financing activities, which include funding obtained from securitization transactions, obtaining brokered and non-brokered certificates of deposit, borrowings under its federal funds purchase agreements, and cash generated from operations. During 2015, the Financial Services segment issued $352 million in certificates of deposit, completed two term securitizations totaling $775 million, and increased its $225 million variable funding facility originally scheduled to mature in March 2015 to $300 million and extended its maturity date to March 2018. We believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund the Financial Services segment's foreseeable cash requirements, including maturities, and near-term growth plans. The Trust has two $300 million term securitizations with expected principal payment due dates in June 2016 and October 2016. The principal payments are expected to be funded from restricted cash generated from credit card operations of the Trust.\nWFB is prohibited by regulations from lending money to Cabela's or other affiliates. WFB is subject to capital requirements imposed by Nebraska banking law and the Visa U.S.A., Inc. membership rules, and its ability to pay dividends is also limited by Nebraska and Federal banking law. If there are any disruptions in the credit markets, the Financial Services segment, like many other financial institutions, may increase its funding from certificates of deposit which may result in increased competition in the deposits market with fewer funds available or at unattractive rates. Our ability to issue certificates of deposit is reliant on our current regulatory capital levels. WFB is classified as a well-capitalized\u201d bank, the highest category under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. If WFB were to be classified as an adequately-capitalized\u201d bank, which is the next level category down from well-capitalized,\u201d we would be required to obtain a waiver from the FDIC in order to continue to issue certificates of deposit. We will invest additional capital in the Financial Services segment, if necessary, in order for WFB to continue to meet the minimum requirements for the well-capitalized\u201d classification under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. In addition to the non-brokered certificates of deposit market to fund growth and maturing securitizations, we have access to the brokered certificates of deposit market through multiple financial institutions for liquidity and funding purposes.\nEffective January 2015, WFB was subject to the interim final rules and the joint final rules adopted by the FDIC in July 2013 pertaining to the implementation of regulatory capital reforms recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010, and capital reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These rules revised the agencies' prompt corrective action framework by introducing a common equity tier 1 capital\u201d requirement and a higher minimum tier 1 capital\u201d requirement. The impact of the adoption of these rules was minimal to WFB.\nFor a discussion of other additional legislative and regulatory developments that pertain to the Financial Services segment, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Current Business Environment - Developments in Legislation and Regulation.\u201d\nOperating, Investing and Financing Activities\nThe following table presents changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended:\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>326,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(778,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,266,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(793,031\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>634,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>956,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>358,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 versus 2014\nOperating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities was $327 million in 2015, a net increase of $69 million compared to 2014. Comparing the respective years, we had a net increase of $84 million related to income taxes, as we paid a deposit of $50 million in 2014 for federal taxes related to prior period uncertain tax positions, a net increase of $50 million in inventories, and an increase of $23 million in provision for loan losses. The increase in inventories in 2015 was primarily due to the addition of new retail stores as inventory levels totaled $819 million at the end of 2015 compared to $760 million at the end of 2014.\nMostly offsetting these increases were net decreases of $32 million relating to accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to increases in inventories and in the number of retail stores; $25 million in other long-term liabilities due to changes related to prior period uncertain positions; $22 million in gift instruments, credit card rewards, and loyalty rewards programs due to increased volume; and $22 million in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nInvesting Activities - Cash used in investing activities decreased $488 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the use of $605 million in restricted cash of the Trust. Restricted cash of the Trust was used to repay $468 million of Series 2010-I and Series 2010-II notes in 2015 and totaled $41 million at January 2, 2016, compared to $335 million at December 27, 2014. Cash paid for property and equipment totaled $413 million in 2015 compared to $441 million in 2014. At January 2, 2016, the Company estimated it had total cash commitments of approximately $182 million outstanding for projected expenditures related to the development, construction, and completion of new retail stores. We expect to fund these estimated capital expenditures over the next 12 months with funds from operations and borrowings. In addition, we had a net decrease in cash of $142 million related to our credit card loan activity from outside sources.\nThe following table presents activity related to our retail stores for the years ended:\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid for property and equipment additions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of new retail stores opened during the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of retail stores at the end of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail square footage at the end of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,932,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,911,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities - Cash provided by financing activities decreased $322 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This net change in cash was primarily due to an decrease in net borrowings on secured obligations of the Trust by the Financial Services segment of $659 million. Our Series 2010-I and Series 2010-II notes totaling $468 million were repaid in 2015 using restricted cash of the Trust, secured variable funding obligations totaling $480 million of the Trust were repaid, and $45 million in variable funding facilities was borrowed in 2014. We also had net decreases comparing the respective periods of $292 million in net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and $31 million in unpresented checks. Lastly, in 2015, we repurchased shares of our common stock at a cost of $174 million.\nThese decreases were partially offset by our issuance in 2015 of $550 million of senior unsecured notes and an increase of $337 million in time deposits compared to 2014, which the Financial Services segment utilizes as a source in funding its credit card operations. The Trust also issues variable funding facilities which are considered secured obligations backed by restricted credit card loans. At January 2, 2016, the Trust had three variable funding facilities with $1.1 billion in total capacity and $655 million outstanding.\nThe following table presents the borrowing activities of our merchandising business and the Financial Services segment for the years ended:\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings (repayments) on revolving credit facilities and inventory financing, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(172,015\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured obligations of the Trust, net of repayments\n</td> <td>366,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance (repayments) of long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>541,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,418\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings, net of repayments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>735,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,201,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our availability under the Company's debt and credit facilities, excluding the facilities of the Financial Services segment, at the years ended:\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts available for borrowing under credit facilities (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>795,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>795,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal amounts outstanding\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(180,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding letters of credit and standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>(20,246\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,064\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining borrowing capacity, excluding the Financial Services segment facilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>774,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>594,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Consists of our revolving credit facility of $775 million and our $20 million CAD credit facility (which for both years has not been translated into United States dollars).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Financial Services segment also has total borrowing availability of $100 million under its agreements to borrow federal funds. At January 2, 2016, the entire $100 million of borrowing capacity was available.\nOur $775 million unsecured credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and other customary covenants, including:\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined) of no less than 2.00 to 1 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters (as defined);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a leverage ratio (as defined) of no more than 3.00 to 1 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a minimum consolidated net worth standard (as defined) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, our unsecured senior notes contain various covenants and restrictions that are usual and customary for transactions of this type. Also, the debt agreements contain cross default provisions to other outstanding credit facilities. In the event that we failed to comply with these covenants, a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable. At January 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes. We anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes through the next 12 months.\n2014 versus 2013\nOperating Activities - Net cash provided from operating activities was $258 million in 2014 compared to $345 million in 2013. We paid a deposit of $50 million in 2014 for federal taxes related to prior period uncertain tax positions, which was the primary reason for the decrease of $71 million in the income tax accounts comparing the respective years. In addition, we had net decreases of $45 million in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to a timing difference in our Visa interchange funding for the Financial Services segment, $27 million in inventories, and $23 million in accounts receivable. Partially offsetting these decreases in cash from operating activities were increases of $80 million relating to accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to increases in inventories and in the number of retail stores, $20 million in gift instruments, credit card rewards, and loyalty rewards programs due to increased volume, and $20 million in depreciation and amortization. We increased inventory levels by $115 million at December 27, 2014, to $760 million, compared to 2013, where our inventory levels increased $92 million compared to year end 2012. The increase in inventories in 2014 was primarily due to the addition of new retail stores.\nInvesting Activities - Cash used in investing activities increased $473 million in 2014 to $1.3 billion compared to 2013. Cash paid for property and equipment additions totaled $441 million in 2014 compared to $333 million in 2013. We estimated we had total cash commitments at December 27, 2014, of approximately $524 million to be funded through the next 12 months for projected expenditures related to the development, construction, and completion of new retail stores, a new distribution center, and expansion of our corporate offices. In addition, we had decreases of $306 million related to the change in restricted cash of the Trust and $60 million related to our credit card loans originated from outside sources. Our restricted cash of the Trust totaled $335 million at December 27, 2014, as we repaid $255 million of Series 2010-I notes in full on January 15, 2015.\nFinancing Activities - Cash provided by financing activities increased $598 million in 2014 to $957 million compared to 2013. This net change was primarily due to an increase in net borrowings on secured obligations of the Trust by the Financial Services segment of $675 million. We also had increases of $185 million in net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and inventory financing. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $285 million relating to changes in time deposits.\nEconomic Development Bonds and Grants\nIn the past, we have negotiated economic development arrangements with many local and state governments relating to the construction of a number of our new retail stores, including free land, monetary grants, and the recapture of incremental sales, property, or other taxes through economic development bonds. Where appropriate, we intend to continue to utilize economic development arrangements with state and local governments to offset some of the construction costs and improve the return on investment of our new retail stores.\nEconomic Development Bonds - Economic development bonds are related to our government economic assistance arrangements relating to the construction of new retail stores or retail development. The payments of principal and interest on the bonds are typically tied to sales, property, or lodging taxes generated from the store and, in some cases, from businesses in the surrounding area, over periods which range between 15 and 30 years. Some of our bonds may be repurchased for par value by the governmental entity prior to the maturity date of the bonds. The governmental entity from which we purchase the bonds is not otherwise liable for repayment of principal and interest on the bonds to the extent that the associated taxes are insufficient to pay the bonds. If sufficient tax revenue is not generated by the subject properties, we will not receive scheduled payments and will be unable to realize the full value of the bonds carried on our consolidated balance sheet. There were no other than temporary fair value adjustments of economic development bonds and no adjustments of deferred grant income related to economic development bonds in 2015 or 2014. However, at the end of 2015, we identified economic development bonds totaling $20 million where the actual tax revenues associated with these properties were lower than previously projected. We will continue to closely monitor the amounts and timing of projected cash flows from the properties related to these economic development bonds. At January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014, economic development bonds totaled $84 million and $82 million, respectively.\nOn a quarterly basis, we perform various procedures to analyze the amounts and timing of projected cash flows to be received from our economic development bonds. Please refer to Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the section entitled Economic Development Bonds\u201d for information on our procedures used to analyze the amounts and timing of projected cash flows to be received from our economic development bonds.\nGrants - Historically, we have received grant funding in exchange for commitments made by us to the state or local government providing the funding. The commitments, such as assurance of agreed employment and wage levels at our retail stores or that the retail store will remain open, typically phase out over approximately five to ten years. If we fail to maintain the commitments during the applicable period, the funds we received may have to be repaid or other adverse consequences may arise, which could affect our cash flows and profitability. The total amount of grant funding subject to a specific contractual remedy was $43 million at both January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014. At January 2, 2016, we had recorded $17 million in the consolidated balance sheets relating to these grants with $16 million in current liabilities and $1 million in long-term liabilities. At December 27, 2014, we had recorded $23 million in current liabilities.\nSecuritization of Credit Card Loans\nThe Financial Services segment historically has funded most of its growth in credit card loans through an asset securitization program. The Financial Services segment utilizes the Trust for the purpose of routinely securitizing credit card loans and issuing beneficial interest to investors. The Trust issues variable funding facilities and long-term notes (collectively referred to herein as secured obligations of the Trust\u201d), each of which has an undivided interest in the assets of the Trust. The Financial Services segment must retain a minimum 20 day average of 5% of the loans in the securitization trust which ranks pari passu with the investors' interests in the Trust. In addition, the Financial Services segment owns notes issued by the Trust from some of the securitizations, which in some cases may be subordinated to other notes issued. The Financial Services segment's retained interests are eliminated upon consolidation of the Trust. The consolidated assets of the Trust are subject to credit, payment, and interest rate risks on the transferred credit card loans. The credit card loans of the Trust are restricted for the repayment of the secured obligations of the Trust.\nTo protect the holders of the secured obligations of the Trust (the investors\u201d), the securitization structures include certain features that could result in earlier-than-expected repayment of the securities, which could cause the Financial Services segment to sustain a loss of one or more of its retained interests and could prompt the need to seek alternative sources of funding. The primary investor protection feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of loans to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. The Financial Services segment refers to this as the early amortization feature. Investors are allocated cash flows derived from activities related to the accounts comprising the securitized pool of loans, the amounts of which reflect finance charges collected, certain fee assessments collected, allocations of interchange, and recoveries on charged off accounts. These cash flows are considered to be restricted under the governing documents to pay interest to investors, servicing fees, and to absorb the investor's share of charge-offs occurring within the securitized pool of loans. Any cash flows remaining in excess of these requirements are reported to investors as excess spread. An excess spread of less than zero percent for a contractually specified period, generally a three-month average, would trigger an early amortization event. Such an event could result in the Financial Services segment incurring losses related to its retained interests. In addition, if the retained interest in the loans of the Financial Services segment falls below the 5% minimum 20 day average and the Financial Services segment fails to add new accounts to the securitized pool of loans, an early amortization event would be triggered.\nAnother feature, which is applicable to the secured obligations of the Trust, is one in which excess cash flows generated by the transferred loans are held at the Trust for the benefit of the investors. This cash reserve account funding is triggered when the three-month average excess spread rate of the Trust decreases to below 4.50% with increasing funding requirements as excess spread levels decline below preset levels or as contractually required by the governing documents. Similar to early amortization, this feature also is designed to protect the investors' interests from loss, thus making the cash restricted. Upon scheduled maturity or early amortization of a securitization, the Financial Services segment is required to remit principal payments received on the securitized pool of loans to the Trust which are restricted for the repayment of the investors' principal note. The investors have no recourse to the Financial Services segment's other assets for failure of debtors to pay other than for breaches of certain customary representations, warranties, and covenants. These representations, warranties, covenants, and the related indemnities do not protect the Trust or third party investors against credit-related losses on the loans.\nThe total amounts and maturities for our credit card securitizations as of January 2, 2016, were as follows:\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

and will continue to be, particularly reliant on funding from securitization transactions for the Financial Services segment. A failure to renew existing facilities or to add additional capacity on favorable terms as it becomes necessary could increase our financing costs and potentially limit our ability to grow the business of the Financial Services segment. Unfavorable conditions in the asset-backed securities markets generally, including the unavailability of commercial bank liquidity support or credit enhancements, could have a similar effect. In 2015, the Financial Services segment completed two term securitizations totaling $775 million and increased its $225 million variable funding facility originally scheduled to mature in March 2015 to $300 million and extended its maturity date to March 2018. In 2016, the Financial Services segment intends to issue additional certificates of deposit and term securitizations. We believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund the Financial Services segment's foreseeable cash requirements, including maturities, and near-term growth plans.\nFurthermore, the securitized credit card loans of the Financial Services segment could experience poor performance, including increased delinquencies and credit losses, lower payment rates, or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds. This could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in the Financial Services segment's securitization transactions, cause early amortization of these securities, or result in higher required credit enhancement levels. Credit card loans performed within established guidelines and no events which could trigger an early amortization occurred during the years ended January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014.\nCertificates of Deposit\nThe Financial Services segment utilizes brokered and non-brokered certificates of deposit to partially finance its operating activities. The Financial Services segment issues certificates of deposit in a minimum amount of one hundred thousand dollars in various maturities. At January 2, 2016, the Financial Services segment had $880 million of certificates of deposit outstanding with maturities ranging from January 2016 to July 2023 and with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 2.23%. This outstanding balance compares to $806 million at December 27, 2014, with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 2.25%. For a summary schedule of the contractual maturities of our certificates of deposit for the last two years, please refer to Note 10 Time Deposits\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three years.

Rent expense for these operating leases is recorded in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Future obligations are shown in the preceding contractual obligations table.\nCredit Card Limits - The Financial Services segment bears off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of its business. One form of this risk is through the Financial Services segment's commitment to extend credit to cardholders up to the maximum amount of their credit limits. The aggregate of such potential funding requirements totaled $35 billion above existing balances at the end of 2015. These funding obligations are not included in our consolidated balance sheet. While the Financial Services segment has not experienced, and does not anticipate that it will experience, a significant draw down of unfunded credit lines by its cardholders, such an event would create a cash need at the Financial Services segment which likely could not be met by our available cash and funding sources. The Financial Services segment has the right to reduce or cancel these available lines of credit at any time.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Cabela's Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates and assumptions. Our estimation processes contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to make these estimates. Should actual results be different than our estimates, we could be exposed to gains or losses from differences that may be material.\nFor a summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the accounting policies discussed below represent accounting policies we apply that are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements.\nMerchandise Revenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized on our Direct sales when merchandise is delivered to the customer with the point of delivery based on our estimate of shipping time from our distribution centers to the customer. We recognize reserves for estimated product returns based upon our historical return experience and expectations. Had our estimate of merchandise in-transit to customers and our estimate of product returns been different by 10% at the end of 2015, our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately $1 million. Sales of gift instruments are recorded in merchandise revenue when the gift instruments are redeemed in exchange for merchandise or services and as a liability prior to redemption. We recognize breakage on gift instruments as revenue when the probability of redemption is remote. Had our estimate of breakage on our recorded liability for gift instruments been different by 10% of the recorded liability at the end of 2015, our merchandise revenue would have been higher or lower by approximately $1 million.\nInventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market. All inventories are finished goods. We estimate the provision for inventory shrinkage based on our historical inventory accuracy rates as determined by periodic and annual cycle counts. The provision for damaged goods from returns is based upon our historical experience. We estimate provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on historical loss, specific identification, product performance statistics, and future merchandising objectives. Had our estimated inventory reserves been different by 10% at the end of 2015, our cost of sales would have been higher or lower by approximately $2 million.\nAllowance for Loan Losses on Credit Cards - The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses and is evaluated by management for adequacy. The measurement of the overall allowance is subject to estimation risk, and the amount of actual losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts. For example, had management's estimate of net losses over the next 12 months been different by 10% at the end of 2015, the Financial Services segment's allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses would have changed by approximately $8 million.\nLong-Lived Assets - Long-lived assets other than goodwill and other intangible assets, which generally are tested separately for impairment on an annual basis, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The calculation for an impairment loss compares the carrying value of the asset to that asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future discounted cash flows, observable market prices, or unobservable market prices. We recognize an impairment loss if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Frequently our impairment loss calculations contain multiple uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting cash flows under different scenarios. We have consistently applied our accounting methodologies that we use to assess impairment loss. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.\nEconomic Development Bonds - On a quarterly basis, we revalue our economic development bonds and evaluate the projected underlying cash flows to determine if the carrying amount of such economic development bonds can be recovered. To the extent the expected cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, the bonds are assessed for impairment. Deficiencies in projected discounted cash flows below the recorded carrying amount of the economic development bonds evidences that we do not expect to recover the cost basis. Consequently, the valuation results in an other than temporary impairment. Had our fair value estimates been lower by 10% at the end of 2015, the value of economic development bonds would have been approximately $8 million less with the unrealized loss reflected in comprehensive income if the loss was deemed to be temporary. Any declines in the fair value of available-for-sale economic development bonds below cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses.\nThere were no other than temporary fair value adjustments of economic development bonds and no adjustments of deferred grant income related to economic development bonds in 2015. However, at the end of 2015, we identified economic development bonds with carrying values of $20 million where the actual tax revenues associated with these properties were lower than previously projected. We will continue to closely monitor the amounts and timing of projected cash flows from the properties related to these economic development bonds.\nIncome Taxes - Income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which we operate and require significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for based on these assessments. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements based on an evaluation of new information. We have not provided United States income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States as of the end of 2015. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related United States tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. We have reserved for potential adjustments to the provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 2 Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Revenues for 2015 totaled $4.0 billion, an increase of $350 million, or 9.6%, compared to 2014, due to increases in total merchandise sales of $280 million and Financial Services revenue of $72 million.\nTotal merchandise sales increased $280 million, or 8.7%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The most significant factors contributing to the net increase in total merchandise sales comparing 2015 to 2014 included the following:\n \u2022 The impact of the 53rd week in 2015 resulted in an increase in merchandise sales of $84 million. \n \u2022 Retail revenue increased $321 million in 2015 compared to 2014 from the addition of new retail stores. \n \u2022 Comparable store sales on a consolidated basis decreased $75 million, or 3.4%, compared to 2014. Comparable store sales results for our stores in the United States, which exclude Canada results and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, decreased 2.2% compared to 2014 mostly due to overall decreases in the clothing and footwear product category. We have seen continued softness in this category as our fall and winter apparel and footwear products were met with unseasonably warm weather across most of our major markets. The decrease in the clothing and footwear product category was partially offset by an increase of approximately $11 million in the general outdoors and hunting equipment product categories with neither of these two categories disproportionately impacting the year over year change more than the other category. The decrease in comparable store sales comparing 2015 to 2014 was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 6.2% partially offset by an increase in the average sales per transaction of 4.4%. \n \u2022 Adjusted for 52 weeks, Direct revenue decreased $45 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to decreases extending across all major product categories attributable to decreases in the \n \u2022 clothing and footwear product category of approximately 51%. \n \u2022 hunting equipment product category of approximately 37%, and \n \u2022 general outdoors product category of approximately 12%. \nA significant factor in the decrease in our clothing and footwear product category was the negative impact that the unseasonably warm weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 had on sales of fall and winter apparel and footwear. The decrease in the hunting equipment product category was due mostly to a shift in ammunition sales from the Direct segment to the Retail segment.\nFinancial Services revenue increased $72 million, or 16.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in Financial Services revenue was primarily due to an increase in interest and fee income due to increases in credit card loans and the revolving rate and an increase in interchange income due to increases in credit card purchases and the interchange rate. Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in the provision for loan losses due primarily to growth in the average outstanding balance of credit card loans and, to a lesser extent, increases in loan delinquencies.\nFor fiscal year 2016, we intend to continue to monitor and take steps that are needed to respond to any number of consumer-related factors that may impact our planned growth in comparable store sales on an annual basis. These steps may include the timing of discounts offered and promotional events to meet consumer preferences or actions taken by our competitors, including demand for firearms and ammunition, which can be very volatile based on current events as well as potential future government regulation. In addition, we will also look at our strategic space allocation and improve space utilization within our stores, as well as changing our brand assortment between national brands and Cabela's brand. We also are working closely with our vendors and actively managing our inventory levels to ensure that we have the adequate quantity and assortment of necessary products available to meet any such consumer-related factors.\nOur merchandise gross profit increased $53 million, or 4.7%, to $1.2 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to new retail store growth. Our merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales decreased 140 basis points to 34.3% in 2015 from 35.7% in 2014 due to our markdown and pricing strategy and, to a lesser extent, increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories. The impact of the decrease due to markdown and pricing strategy was disproportionately higher than the change due to increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories.\nOperating income decreased $28 million, or 8.2%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased 150 basis points to 7.7% in 2015 compared to 9.2% in 2014. The decrease in total operating income was due to increases in consolidated operating expenses and impairment and restructuring charges and a decrease in revenue from our Direct segment. Net increases in revenue from our Retail and Financial Services segments and an increase in our merchandise gross profit partially offset the decrease in total operating income.\nOperating expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of retail stores and costs in related support areas and due to an increase in incentive compensation in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2014, we did not incur any incentive compensation expense. Impairment and restructuring charges increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to (i) impairment losses totaling $10 million relating to the write-off of costs pertaining to previously identified store sites and the write-down to fair value of certain land properties and (ii) a $6 million charge for severance and related benefits due to a corporate office restructure and reduction in the number of personnel.\nIn the second half of 2015, we launched a major multi-year corporate restructuring project aimed at lowering the Company's operating expense base to increase our return on invested capital. We have identified numerous meaningful savings opportunities across the Company, including information technology process improvement, indirect procurement, retail labor optimization, merchandise sourcing, retail support functions, and supply chain enhancements, some of which we have already implemented, that are expected to result in a reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue by 75 to 150 basis points over the next three years. As we focus on expense management controls consistent with our multi-year corporate restructuring project, we plan to continue our omni-channel initiatives, our Cabela's branded product investments, and our retail expansion, with current plans to open eight stores in 2016. We will continue to manage our operating costs accordingly through fiscal 2016.\nFiscal 2015 consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal 2014 consisted of 52 weeks. The table below presents results for 2015 excluding the effect of revenue earned in the last week of 2015 in order to show comparable data with 2014 and reconciles our presentation of total revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) to the non-GAAP presentation excluding the 53rd week results. Management believes these non-GAAP financial results provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding revenues and trends and performance of our ongoing operations and are useful for year-over-year comparisons of such results. In addition, management evaluates results using non-GAAP adjusted total revenue. These non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP. Financial Services was not adjusted because its reporting periods end on a calendar year.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015 (Excluding 53rd Week)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,592,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>241,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>806,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44,965\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total merchandise sales\n</td> <td>3,399,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,202,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>502,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>12,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,722\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue (non-GAAP basis)\n</td> <td>3,913,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,647,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue - week 53\n</td> <td>83,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,997,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,647,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe impact of the 53rd week in 2015 was to increase total revenue and revenue from our merchandising businesses by $84 million. Adjusting to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014, revenues for 2015 totaled $3.9 billion, an increase of 7.3% compared to 2014, and revenue in our merchandising business for 2015 increased $197 million, or 6.1%, compared to 2014. The net increase in total merchandise sales comparing 2015 to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from new stores opened during 2015, partially offset by decreases in comparable store sales and Direct revenue.\nThe following summarizes the operating results of our three business segments. For a more detailed discussion, see Results of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\u201d.\nRetail segment results for 2015 compared to 2014 were as follows:\n \u2022 revenue increased $308 million, or 13.1% (adjusted to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014, revenue increased$242 million, or 10.3%); \n \u2022 operating income increased $7 million, or 1.7%; \n \u2022 operating income as a percentage of Retail segment revenue decreased 180 basis points to 16.0%; and \n \u2022 comparable store sales on a consolidated basis decreased 3.4%, and for our United States locations decreased 2.2%, both percentages adjusted to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014.  The stores we opened in 2015 did not meet our sales and profitability expectations so we are slowing new store growth over the next two years as we address retail store performance and productivity. For 2016, we plan to open eight new stores with total retail square footage of approximately 600,000, which is over 7% annual square footage growth compared to the end of 2015.\nIn September 2015, we began operations in our new 600,000 square foot distribution center in Tooele, Utah, which will help to support our growth. In November 2015, we opened a 98,000 square foot distribution center located in Puyallup, Washington, which is near Tacoma, Washington. This leased facility allowed us to eliminate third party warehousing services on the west coast in January 2016 and to timely prioritize in-bound international freight destined for our inland distribution centers and stores, which will increase our internal service levels and deliver our products throughout our network more efficiently. In March 2015, we closed our distribution center in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, as our merchandise needs in Canada are now processed by a third-party logistics provider through a leased facility in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nDirect segment results for 2015 compared to 2014 were as follows:\n \u2022 revenue decreased $28 million, or 3.3% (adjusted to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014, revenue decreased$45 million, or 5.3%); \n \u2022 operating income decreased $30 million, or 26.4%; and \n \u2022 operating income as a percentage of Direct segment revenue decreased 310 basis points to 10.1%.  Cabela's CLUB continues to manage credit card delinquencies and charge-offs below industry average by adhering to our conservative underwriting criteria and active account management. Comparing Cabela's CLUB results for 2015 to 2014:\n \u2022 Financial Services revenue increased $72 million, or 16.8%; \n \u2022 the average number of active accounts increased 6.8% to 1.9 million, and the average balance per active account increased $134; \n \u2022 the average balance of our credit card loans increased 13.4% to $4.5 billion; \n \u2022 net purchases on credit card accounts increased 6.0% to $20.2 billion; and \n \u2022 net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased one basis point to 1.70%. \nIn 2015, the Financial Services segment issued $352 million in certificates of deposit, completed two term securitizations totaling $775 million, and increased a $225 million variable funding facility originally scheduled to mature in March 2015 to $300 million and extended its maturity date to March 2018.\nVision 2020\nOur vision is to be the world's best omni-channel retailer by creating intense loyalty for our outdoor brand through the legendary products and customer service delivered by our highly trained outfitters.\nGame Plan for Growth. Central to Vision 2020 is our Game Plan for Growth.\u201d We see the potential to continue taking market share in the fragmented outdoor market, while growing organically through customer loyalty and by providing rich customer experiences in every business channel. By embracing the diverse nature of the outdoor marketplace, and regional preferences, we will be able to capitalize on the best of both traditions and trends in outfitting our customers. This means bringing customers quality products that allow them to enjoy the outdoor traditions that bring them closer to nature, and family and friends - while meeting their expectations for great values and the latest products that make their outdoors pursuits more productive and enjoyable.\nThe Game Plan for Growth is defined by two strategies: Focus on the Core and Foremost Advantage.\nFocus on the Core - Focus on the Core will concentrate investment and resources to the categories customers most identify with Cabela's, and where customers demand the most from us in product selection, availability, and expertise - Hunting, Fishing, Camping, and Shooting Sports.\nForemost Advantage - Based on our heritage as the World's Foremost Outfitter, the Foremost Advantage aligns business strategies to a framework developed with over 50 years of deep customer insights. This framework will drive revenue and shareholder returns by focusing on our customers and is defined by four areas: Experience, Expertise, Excellent Value and Exceptional Products.\n \u2022 Experience - Engaging customers with rich, relevant experiences in every channel to drive a cycle of repeat visits and sales growth. \n \u2022 Expertise - Proving to customers that we are the foremost outdoor experts in the retail industry by offering end-use knowledge and experience that is trusted above all others. \n \u2022 Excellent Value - Winning customer loyalty and increasing customer purchases with the value propositions we create. \n \u2022 Exceptional Products - Offering products that meet customer demands in quality and performance.  Strategic Focus Areas\nVision 2020 and the Growth Game Plan are anchored by six strategic focus areas that will ensure winning results by defining measurable objectives and aligning strategies across the enterprise:\n \u2022 Improve Top-Line Sales \n \u2022 Increase Bottom-Line Profits \n \u2022 Retail Store Expansion and Innovation \n \u2022 Customers First \n \u2022 Focus on All Outfitters \n \u2022 Grow the CLUB  Improve Top-Line Sales - We believe smarter assortments and better floor space utilization will continue improving retail comparable store sales. Our retail merchandise performance will also be supported by focusing on the core categories of our business, while delivering top national brands, excellent values, and exceptional products for our customers. Our Direct business is poised to continue making improvements to the omni-channel customer experience and support total sales by investments in revenue-driving digital programs that support wins across both the Retail and Direct businesses.\nIncrease Bottom-Line Profits - Our leadership is focused on driving rigor into the business to rapidly advance business maturity, while committing to a continuous improvement culture and earning the right to be a test and learn company. We are also aggressively transforming our business by adopting leading practices to drive revenue, leverage expenses, gain competitive advantage, and increase profitability in all business units.\nRetail Store Expansion and Innovation - We believe it is imperative to continue innovating how we select, design, and build our retail stores, while applying best-in-class omni-channel retail practices to improve customer experience and reduce expenses from groundbreaking to grand opening. Ongoing efforts are using learnings from our legacy in destination retail, our extensive internal customer analytics capabilities, and relationships with external partners and industry leaders to triangulate solutions that will satisfy customers and shareholders.\nCustomers First - Our founders believed customer service was the centerpiece of every Cabela's experience. We have pro-staff programs connecting influential industry leaders and local experts with Cabela's customers in our retail stores. Our hunters' education programs are proactively working to reduce a national shortage of hunters' education instructors with a grassroots effort centered in our stores and led by our outfitters. We are also partnering with top brands to increase sales by providing more customer service and expertise in retail stores, without increasing expenses. We have made it easier and simpler than ever before for customers to complete an order online on any device, check inventory availability at their local stores, and connect to Cabela's on all types of social media. Multiple channel order delivery capabilities also allow us to optimize delivery expectations for customers while minimizing transportation costs. We have the capability to deliver distribution center to customer, retail store to customer, vendor to customer, in-store-pickup from retail store inventory, and in-store-pickup from distribution center inventory.\nFocus on All Outfitters - Promoting diversity across the business, and building an employee base of outfitters that hails from across the country is a key component of Vision 2020. Our leadership believes in embracing people of all backgrounds and viewpoints, because there is greater value in multiple perspectives and varied experiences. We call all our employees outfitters\u201d for good reason. Every outfitter that interacts with a customer needs outdoor expertise, whether they are working at a cash register or building a webpage. This makes providing opportunities for outfitters to enjoy the outdoor lifestyle a priority. We accomplish this through work-life balance, discount programs, and opportunities to learn first-hand about core outdoor pursuits.\nGrow the CLUB - We must continue to foster and promote the close relationship between the merchandising business and Cabela's CLUB. Our efforts lead to perennial increases in cardholders through organic growth and retail store expansion in the United States. This close partnership between the merchandising business and Cabela's CLUB also allows our tiered loyalty programs to increase average balances of credit card loans and total credit card loans outstanding on an annual basis.\nCurrent Business Environment\nMacroeconomic Environment - In 2015, we experienced a challenging consumer environment across all business channels. To address these issues, we increased our promotional activity, adjusted our marketing spending, and implemented operating expense controls to levels consistent with how our business was performing. In addition, during the last half of 2015, we launched a major multi-year corporate restructuring project aimed at lowering the Company's operating expenses. The Financial Services segment continues to monitor developments in the securitization and certificates of deposit markets to ensure adequate access to liquidity. We expect our charge-off rates and delinquency levels to remain below industry averages.\nDevelopments in Legislation and Regulation - Since the latter part of 2012, there has been significant discussion regarding enacted gun control legislation and potential gun control legislation, primarily aimed at modern sporting rifles, certain semiautomatic pistols, and high capacity magazines. For example, the States of Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, and New York have enacted legislation that prohibits the sale of certain high capacity magazines and, in some cases, the sale of certain firearms. We do not expect this state legislation to have a significant impact on our business. We are a federally licensed firearm dealer that conducts required background checks on prospective firearms purchasers. As such, we do not expect the executive action announced in January 2016 regarding background checks for all purchases of firearms to have a significant impact on our business. Any new federal legislation that prohibits the sale of certain modern sporting rifles, semiautomatic pistols, or ammunition could negatively impact our hunting equipment sales.\nPursuant to certain liquidity requirements under the interim final rules and the joint final rules implemented under the regulatory capital reforms recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (referred to as Basel III\u201d), the noteholders under two of the variable funding facilities issued under WFB's securitization program have requested and obtained amendments to their respective transaction documents. In one case, the amendments permit the noteholders to delay funding an advance requested under that facility for up to 35 days. In the other case, the amendments require WFB to provide 35 days' prior notice in connection with requests for certain advances. These changes and any similar changes requested by the noteholders under any other variable funding facility could delay or disrupt access to funding under the variable funding facilities. Moreover, the liquidity requirements under Basel III could result in an increase in the borrowing costs under the variable funding facilities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act\u201d) was signed into law in July 2010 and has made extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and credit rating agencies and requires significant rule-making. The changes resulting from the Reform Act may impact our profitability, require changes to certain Financial Services segment business practices, impose upon the Financial Services segment more stringent capital, liquidity, and leverage ratio requirements, increase the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's ( FDIC\u201d) deposit insurance premiums, or otherwise adversely affect the Financial Services segment's business. These changes may also require the Financial Services segment to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes.\nThe Reform Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the Bureau\u201d) within the Federal Reserve, a new federal consumer protection regulator. The Bureau has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings, and payment services and products, and WFB is subject to its regulation. While the Bureau does not currently examine WFB, it receives information from the FDIC, WFB's primary regulator. The Bureau also has rulemaking and interpretive authority under existing and future consumer financial services laws. The Bureau is specifically authorized to issue rules identifying as unlawful acts or practices it defines as unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices\u201d in connection with a consumer or in connection with a consumer financial product or service.\nThe Bureau, the FDIC, and other agencies have recently announced several high-profile enforcement actions against credit card issuers for deceptive marketing and other illegal practices related to the advertising of ancillary products, collection practices, and other matters. By these recent public enforcement actions, the Bureau and the FDIC have signaled a heightened scrutiny of credit card issuers. Across the industry, we anticipate increased activity by regulators in pursuing consumer protection claims going forward.\nSeveral rules and regulations have been proposed or adopted that may substantially affect issuers of asset-backed securities. On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) approved joint final regulations implementing the provisions of the Reform Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule.\u201d Generally, the Volcker Rule and the implementing regulations prohibit any banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund, subject to exemptions for certain permitted activities. These regulations limit our ability to engage in the types of transactions covered by the Volcker Rule, and may impose compliance, monitoring, and reporting obligations on us and WFB under certain circumstances. Although the effective date of the regulations is April 1, 2014, the Federal Reserve approved an extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2016, and has announced its intention to further extend the conformance period until July 21, 2017. We are continuing to assess the impact, if any, that the Volcker Rule and the implementing regulation will have on our Retail, Direct, and Financial Services segments, but we do not expect the Volcker Rule to have a material impact on WFB's securitization program.\nThe Cabela's Master Credit Card Trust and related entities (collectively referred to as the Trust\u201d) is structured to qualify for the exemption from the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act\u201d) provided by Investment Company Act Rule 3a-7. On August 31, 2011, the SEC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible amendments to Investment Company Act Rule 3a-7. At this time, it is uncertain what form the related proposed and final rules will take, whether the Trust would continue to be eligible to rely on the exemption provided by Investment Company Act Rule 3a-7, and whether the Trust would qualify for any other Investment Company Act exemption.\nOn August 27, 2014, the SEC adopted certain rules ( SEC Regulation AB II\u201d) that will change the disclosure, reporting, and offering process for public offerings of asset-backed securities, including those issued under WFB's securitization program. SEC Regulation AB II had been originally proposed by the SEC on April 7, 2010, and was reproposed by the SEC on July 26, 2011. Among other things, SEC Regulation AB II imposes as a condition for the shelf registration of asset-backed securities the filing of a certification concerning the disclosure contained in the prospectus and the design of the securitization at the time of each offering off the shelf and the appointment of a credit risk manager to review assets when credit enhancement requirements are not met or at the direction of investors. As originally proposed and re-proposed, SEC Regulation AB II would have required the disclosure of group-level data regarding the receivables in a credit card securitization, but this requirement was not included in the final rule as adopted. There can be no assurances that the SEC will not require disclosure of group-level data in credit card securitizations in the future. We are continuing to assess the impact of SEC Regulation AB II on WFB's securitization program.\nOn October 22, 2014, pursuant to the provisions of the Reform Act, the FDIC, the SEC, the Federal Reserve, and certain other federal agencies adopted regulations that impose a five percent risk retention requirement for credit card securitizations that are issued after December 2016. We have not determined whether WFB's existing forms of risk retention will satisfy the regulatory requirements, whether structural changes will be necessary, or whether the risk retention requirement will impact the Financial Services segment's ability or desire to continue to rely on the securitization market for funding.\nOn September 19, 2011, the SEC proposed a new rule under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to implement certain provisions of the Reform Act. Under the proposed rule, an underwriter, placement agent, initial purchaser, or sponsor of an asset-backed security, or any affiliate of any such person, shall not at any time within one year after the first closing of the sale of the asset-backed security engage in any transaction that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest with respect to any investor in a transaction arising out of such activity. The proposed rule would exempt certain risk mitigating hedging activities, liquidity commitments, and bona fide market-making activity. It is not clear how the final rule will differ from the proposed rule, if at all. The final rule's impact on the securitization market and the Financial Services segment is also unclear at this time.\nOperations Review\nOur operating results expressed as a percentage of revenue were as follows for the years ended:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>57.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>42.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>34.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment and restructuring charges\n</td> <td>0.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>7.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(0.57\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.61\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other income, net\n</td> <td>0.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>(0.33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.47\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>7.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>2.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>4.74\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.53\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues\nRetail revenue includes sales realized and customer services performed at our retail stores, sales from orders placed through our retail store Internet kiosks, and sales from customers utilizing our in-store pick-up program. Direct revenue includes Internet and call center (catalog) sales from orders placed through our website, over the phone, and by mail where the merchandise is shipped through our omni-channel fulfillment process to our customers at locations of their choice. Retail and Direct revenue also includes sales from the redemption of loyalty points earned by Cabela's CLUB Visa cardholders of our Financial Services segment. Financial Services revenue is comprised of interest and fee income, interchange income, other non-interest income, interest expense, provision for loan losses, and customer rewards costs from our credit card operations. Other revenue sources include the value of unredeemed points earned that are associated with the Company's loyalty rewards programs for Cabela's CLUB issued credit cards, net of the estimated costs of the points; fees for hunting and fishing outfitter services; fees from a full-service travel agency business; real estate rental income and land sales; and other complementary business services.\nOur retail stores are included in our distribution network through the omni-channel fulfillment process. Therefore, we ship products to our customers from both our distribution centers and our retail stores, so customers who order through our call centers or website are not solely dependent upon the stock we have in our distribution centers.\nComparisons and analysis of our revenues are presented below for the years ended:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,658,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,350,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>823,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,452\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>502,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>13,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,822\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,997,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,647,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Sales Mix - The following table sets forth the percentage of our merchandise revenue contributed by major product categories for our Retail and Direct segments and in total for the years ended:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Direct\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hunting Equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Outdoors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clothing and Footwear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe hunting equipment merchandise category includes a wide variety of firearms, ammunition, optics, archery products, and related accessories and supplies. The general outdoors merchandise category includes a full range of equipment and accessories supporting all outdoor activities, including all types of fishing and tackle products, boats and marine equipment, camping gear and equipment, food preparation and outdoor cooking products, all-terrain vehicles and accessories for automobiles and all-terrain vehicles, and gifts and home furnishings. The clothing and footwear merchandise category includes fieldwear apparel and footwear, sportswear, casual clothing and footwear, and workwear products.\nRetail Revenue - Retail revenue increased $308 million, or 13.1%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase of $321 million in revenue from the addition of new retail stores. The 53rd week in 2015 increased Retail revenue by $66 million; therefore, adjusted for 52 weeks, Retail revenue increased $242 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\nThe increase in retail revenue from new retail stores was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of $75 million. A store is included in our comparable store sales base on the first day of the month following the fifteen month anniversary of 1) its opening or acquisition, or 2) any changes to retail store space greater than 25% of total square footage of the store.\nComparable store sales and analysis are presented below for the years ended:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable stores sales on a consolidated basis\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,093,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,167,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74,729\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable stores sales - United States stores only\n</td> <td>1,984,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,028,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44,243\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable stores sales on a constant currency basis (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Excludes the 53rd week in 2015 to present on a comparable 52-week basis. \n (2) Reflects the elimination of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. \nComparable store sales on a consolidated basis decreased $75 million, or 3.4%, compared to 2014. Comparable store sales results for our stores in the United States, which exclude Canada results and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, decreased 2.2% compared to 2014 mostly due to overall decreases in the clothing and footwear product category. The decrease in the clothing and footwear product category was partially offset by an increase of approximately $11 million in the general outdoors and hunting equipment product categories with neither of these two categories disproportionately impacting the year over year change more than the other category.\nWe have seen continued softness in our apparel categories as our fall and winter assortments were met with unseasonably warm weather across most of our major markets. The decrease in comparable store sales comparing 2015 to 2014 was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 6.2% partially offset by an increase in the average sales per transaction of 4.4%. To respond to the softness of sales in our apparel and footwear categories, we have taken a number of actions. We have tested national brand shops in a number of stores, and the results indicate no gross margin rate loss versus our base stores, greater productivity in sales per square foot, and higher penetration of casual apparel sales versus the base. We plan to increase the store count in this test in 2016. We also will be testing alternate labor strategies in our apparel areas to provide better sales coverage during peak selling times. Lastly, our plan for 2016 assumes a greater focus on everyday value in the better\u201d part of our assortment.\nAverage sales per square foot for stores that were open during the entire year were $344 for 2015 compared to $348 for 2014. Our new format stores continue to generate an increase in sales per square foot compared to our legacy stores. However, the stores we opened in 2015 did not meet our sales and profitability expectations and, as a result, we intend to slow new store growth over the next two years as we address retail store performance and productivity. Currently, we are analyzing our store model to assess store level performance and productivity including sales per square foot, store operating contribution margin, store cash flow, construction costs within a store, allocation of space within a store, brand assortment between national brands and Cabela's brand, and customer experience within a store. Our goal is to have a store model that is more predictable in order to maximize sales, margins, cash flows, and an acceptable return on invested capital. We plan to open eight new stores in 2016 with total retail square footage of approximately 600,000, which is over 7% annual square footage growth compared to the end of 2015.\nIn addition, our Cabela's branded products continue to be a core focus for us, as we saw growth of over 1% in Cabela's branded product categories in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2015, our Cabela's branded merchandise accounted for approximately 24% of total merchandise revenue compared to approximately 26% in 2014.\nWe recognize revenue as gift certificates and gift cards ( gift instruments\u201d) are redeemed for merchandise or services. We record gift instrument breakage as Retail revenue when the probability of redemption is remote. Gift instrument breakage recognized was $10 million and $9 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our gift instrument liability at the end of 2015 and 2014 was $184 million and $175 million, respectively.\nDirect Revenue - Direct revenue decreased $28 million, or 3.3%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The 53rd week in 2015 increased Direct revenue by $17 million; therefore, adjusted for 52 weeks, Direct revenue decreased $45 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in Direct revenue was due to decreases in each of our three major product categories comparing the respective years attributable to decreases in the\n \u2022 clothing and footwear product category of approximately 51%, \n \u2022 hunting equipment product category of approximately 37%, and \n \u2022 general outdoors product category of approximately 12%.  A significant factor in the decrease in our clothing and footwear product category was the negative impact that the unseasonably warm weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 had on sales of fall and winter apparel and footwear. The decrease in the hunting equipment product category was due mostly to a shift in ammunition sales from the Direct segment to the Retail segment.\nInternet sales increased slightly in 2015 (53 weeks) compared to 2014 (52 weeks). The number of visitors to our website increased 15% in 2015 compared to a decrease of 8% in 2014 as we saw a return to normalized traffic after the surge in sales of ammunition in 2013 and the subsequent decrease in 2014. We intend to expand our drop-ship sales program through our high traffic website, which will increase the exposure of national brands, provide low risk expansion of product lines, and provide faster distribution of products.\nFinancial Services Revenue - The following table sets forth the components of Financial Services revenue for the years ended: Table 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fee income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>481,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(68,827\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>(85,120\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61,922\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net interest income, net of provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>327,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>274,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interchange income\n</td> <td>394,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>366,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other non-interest income\n</td> <td>2,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>397,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>369,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Customer rewards costs\n</td> <td>(222,268\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(214,445\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>502,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>430,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Services revenue increased $72 million, or 16.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014.

The increase in interchange income of $27 million was primarily due to increases in credit card purchases and the interchange rate. The increase in the provision for loan losses of $23 million was due to growth in the average outstanding balance of credit card loans and, to a lesser extent, increases in loan delinquencies.\nThe following table sets forth the components of Financial Services revenue as a percentage of average total credit card loans, including any accrued interest and fees, for the years ended:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fee income\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interchange income\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-interest income\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer rewards costs\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services revenue\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Cabela's CLUB Visa credit card loyalty program allows customers to earn points whenever and wherever they use their credit card, and then redeem earned points for products and services at our retail stores or through our Direct business.

The average balance of credit card loans increased to $4.5 billion, or 13.4%, for 2015 compared to 2014 due to increases in the number of active accounts and the average balance per account. We define an active credit card account as any account with an outstanding debit or credit balance at the end of any respective month. The average number of active accounts increased to 1.9 million, or 6.8%, compared to 2014 due to our successful marketing efforts in new account acquisitions. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased to 1.70% for 2015, up one basis point compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in loan delinquencies and a decrease in payment rates, partially offset by improvements in recovery rates. Recovery rates were positively impacted in 2015 due to a bulk sale of bankruptcy loans and acceleration of the timing of a sale of charged-off loans, which resulted in an 11 basis point reduction in the charge-off rate.\nSee Asset Quality of Cabela's CLUB\u201d in this report for additional information on trends in delinquencies and non-accrual loans and analysis of our allowance for loan losses.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue decreased $2 million in 2015 to $13 million compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales revenue in 2015 compared to 2014.\nMerchandise Gross Profit\nMerchandise gross profit is defined as merchandise sales, including shipping fees charged to customers, less the costs of related merchandise sold and shipping costs.

Our merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales decreased 140 basis points to 34.3% in 2015 from 35.7% in 2014 due to our markdown and pricing strategy and, to a lesser extent, increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories. The impact of the decrease due to markdown and pricing strategy was disproportionately higher than the change due to increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories.\nSelling, Distribution, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, distribution, and administrative expenses ( SD&A\u201d) include all operating expenses related to our retail stores, website, distribution centers, product procurement, Cabela's CLUB credit card operations, and overhead costs, including: advertising and marketing, catalog costs, employee compensation and benefits, occupancy costs, information systems processing, and depreciation and amortization.\nComparisons and analysis of our SD&A expenses are presented below for the years ended:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SD&A expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,387,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,251,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SD&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail store pre-opening costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSD&A expenses increased $136 million, or 10.9%, in 2015 (53 weeks) compared to 2014 (52 weeks). SD&A expenses increased primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas and a $14 million increase in incentive compensation in 2015. We did not incur any incentive compensation expense in 2014. In 2015, we incurred a $6 million charge for severance and related benefits (which was included in impairment and restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of income) due to a corporate office restructure and reduction in the number of personnel. In addition to this reduction in the number of corporate personnel, we continue to focus on expense management throughout the Company pursuant to a major multi-year corporate restructuring project aimed at lowering the Company's operating expense base. In 2015, we identified several expense reduction opportunities that we have implemented or are in the process of implementing that should benefit operating income in upcoming periods. The goal of this restructuring project is to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue by 75 to 150 basis points over the next three years.\nThe most significant factors contributing to the changes in SD&A expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 included:\n \u2022 an increase of $94 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas, which increase also includes a $14 million increase in incentive compensation in 2015; and \n \u2022 an increase of $32 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and to the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores as well as corporate offices. \nSignificant changes in our consolidated SD&A expenses related to specific business segments included:\nRetail Segment:\n \u2022 An increase of $43 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to the opening of new retail stores. \n \u2022 An increase of $27 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and to the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores. \nDirect Segment:\n \u2022 A decrease of $1 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor in part related to our emphasis on operating expense management. \nFinancial Services Segment:\n \u2022 An increase of $9 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor to support the growth of credit card operations. \nCorporate Overhead, Distribution Centers, and Other:\n \u2022 An increase of $43 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to costs in related support areas, which increase also includes a $14 million increase in incentive compensation in 2015. \n \u2022 An increase of $5 million in building costs primarily related to the operations and maintenance of our corporate office to support operational growth.

In 2015 and 2014, we evaluated the recoverability of economic development bonds, property (including existing store locations and future retail store sites), equipment, goodwill, other property, and other intangible assets. We intend to sell our other property as soon as any such sale could be economically feasible, and we continue to monitor such property for impairment.\nIn 2015, we recognized an impairment loss of $4 million relating to the write-off of costs pertaining to store sites we had previously identified as future retail store locations but in 2015 decided not to develop based on the Company's plans to scale back retail store expansion for 2016 and 2017. This impairment was recorded in the Retail segment. Also in 2015, an impairment loss totaling $6 million was recognized on three separate parcels of land. The fair value on two parcels of land were based on appraisals and the fair value on the third parcel of land was based on discounted cash flow projection estimates (Level 3 inputs). This impairment loss was recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment. We did not recognize any impairment during 2014.\nLocal economic trends, government regulations, and other restrictions where we own properties may impact management projections that could change undiscounted cash flows in future periods and which could trigger possible future write downs.\nRestructuring Charges - In 2015, we incurred charges totaling $6 million for severance and related benefits due to a corporate office restructure and reduction in the number of personnel. The liability for severance benefits was included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and will be reduced as payments are disbursed, which will be substantially completed over the next 12 months. The charges were recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment.\nIn June 2014, we announced the transition to a third-party logistics provider for our distribution needs in Canada and the closing of our distribution center in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Accordingly, in 2014, we recognized a restructuring charge related to employee severance agreements and termination benefits totaling approximately $1 million. This restructuring charge was recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income is revenue less cost of revenue; selling, distribution, and administrative expenses; and impairment and restructuring charges. Operating income for our merchandise business segments excludes costs associated with operating expenses of distribution centers, procurement activities, and other corporate overhead costs.\nComparisons and analysis of operating income are presented below for the years ended:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,603\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income by business segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>424,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>82,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>172,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percentage of segment revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal operating income decreased $28 million, or 8.2%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and total operating income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 150 basis points to 7.7% for 2015. The decreases in total operating income and total operating income as a percentage of total revenue were primarily due to increases in consolidated operating expenses and impairment and restructuring charges and a decrease in revenue from our Direct segment. These decreases to operating income were partially offset by increases in revenue from our Retail and Financial Services segments and an increase in our merchandise gross profit. Operating expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas, and due to an increase in incentive compensation in 2015 as we did not incur any incentive compensation expense in 2014. We are focusing on expense management throughout the Company and have implemented many expense reduction efforts that should continue to benefit operating income in upcoming periods. We plan to continue our retail expansion, our omni-channel initiatives, and our Cabela's branded product investments as we focus on expense management controls consistent with our multi-year corporate restructuring project.\nUnder an Intercompany Agreement, the Financial Services segment pays to the Retail and Direct business segments a fixed license fee that includes 70 basis points on all originated charge volume of the Cabela's CLUB Visa credit card portfolio. In addition, among other items, the agreement requires the Financial Services segment to reimburse the Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs, which are recorded as a reduction to Financial Services segment revenue and as a reduction to merchandise costs associated with the Retail and Direct segments. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, this reimbursement from our Financial Services segment to our Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs has been adjusted to eliminate in consolidation. Periods prior to the second quarter of 2014 have not been adjusted.\nAlso, if the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB is greater than 13% at any quarter end, the Financial Services segment must pay an additional license fee to the Retail and Direct business segments equal to 50% of the amount that the total risk-based capital ratio exceeds 13%. At December 31, 2015, and the end of each calendar quarter in 2015, the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB did not exceed this 13% threshold, so no additional license fee was paid. At March 31, 2014, the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB exceeded 13%. Therefore, in accordance with our Intercompany Agreement, an additional license fee of $11 million was paid in April 2014 by the Financial Services segment to the Retail segment ($7 million) and Direct segment ($4 million) and was classified in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses. Comparing the changes in operating income as a percentage of segment revenue in 2015 to 2014, this additional license fee payment of $11 million to our segments accounted for:\n\u20220.3% of the 1.8% decrease for the Retail segment,\n\u20220.5% of the 3.1% decrease for the Direct segment, and\n\u20222.6% of the 9.0% increase for the Financial Services segment.\nTotal fees paid under the Intercompany Agreement by the Financial Services segment to these two segments, including the $11 million payment in 2014 triggered by the excess total risk-based capital ratio provision, increased $2 million in 2015 compared to 2014; a $13 million increase to the Retail segment and an $11 million decrease to the Direct segment.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, was $23 million and $22 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We incur interest expense on our revolving credit facilities, our long-term debt, and on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits. The amount of interest capitalized increased to $10 million in 2015 compared to $8 million in 2014 primarily due to our new corporate facility and the distribution center in Tooele, Utah. However, this increase in the amount of interest capitalized comparing the respective years was partially offset due to additional interest expense recognized in 2015 associated with our uncertain tax positions, the issuances of the new unsecured notes for $250 million in August 2015 and $300 million in December 2015, and higher outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOther Non-Operating Income, Net\nOther non-operating income was $10 million in 2015 compared to $5 million in 2014. This income is primarily from interest earned on our economic development bonds.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 35.7% in 2015 compared to 36.7% in 2014. The decrease in our effective tax rate comparing the respective years was primarily due to a decrease in our effective tax rate related to tax adjustments attributable to changes in the mix of taxable income between the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions and completion of a retroactive research and development tax credit study during 2015. These decreases in our effective tax rate were partially offset by increases in unrecognized tax benefits and a deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to Canada taxable net operating losses.\nThe balance of unrecognized tax benefits totaled $73 million at January 2, 2016, and was classified in long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, compared to a total of $102 million at December 27, 2014, with $46 million classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities and $56 million in long-term liabilities.\nResults of Operations -

In addition, the $255 million decrease in comparable store sales was across all major product categories comparing 2014 to 2013, and was attributable to decreases in the\n \u2022 hunting equipment product category of approximately 76%, \n \u2022 general outdoors product category of approximately 11%, and \n \u2022 clothing and footwear product category of approximately 13%. \nAs noted in the preceding paragraph, most of the decrease in comparable store sales was due to a decrease in the hunting equipment product category, with 87% of such decrease primarily due to a decrease in sales of firearms and ammunition, as consumer demand for firearms and ammunition was significantly greater in 2013 compared to 2014. We believed that the decreases in sales of firearms and ammunition had begun to level out in 2014, and we expected sales of firearms and ammunition to return to more normalized levels in fiscal 2015. Gift instrument breakage recognized was $9 million and $7 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Average sales per square foot for stores that were open during the entire year were $348 for 2014 compared to $385 for 2013 due to the reasons discussed above. However, our new format retail stores continued to perform better on a sales per square foot basis than our legacy stores.\nDirect Revenue - Direct revenue decreased $122 million, or 12.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013. This $122 million decrease in Direct revenue was across all major product categories and was attributable to decreases in the\n \u2022 hunting equipment product category of approximately 72%, \n \u2022 general outdoors product category of approximately 8%, and \n \u2022 clothing and footwear product category of approximately 20%. \nAs noted above, most of the decrease in Direct revenue was due to a decrease in the hunting equipment product category with 82% of such decrease primarily due to a decrease in sales of ammunition and other shooting related products compared to 2013. Although we are not able to specifically quantify the impact, we believe that our Direct revenue also decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 from expected cannibalization due to our customers shopping at new Cabela's retail store locations.\nInternet sales decreased in 2014 compared to 2013. The number of visitors to our website decreased 8% in 2014 after experiencing record growth of nearly 26% in 2013 due to the surge in sales of ammunition. Our website traffic was also negatively effected by the expected cannibalization from our new retail store growth. Our hunting equipment and general outdoors categories were the largest dollar volume contributors to our Direct revenue for 2014. The number of active Direct customers, which we define as those customers who have purchased merchandise from us in the last twelve months, remained relatively even compared to 2013.\nWe continued to focus on smaller, more specialized catalogs, and we reduced the number of pages mailed and decreased total circulation, leading to continued reductions in catalog related costs. Increases in website and mobile platform related expenses due to our expanded use of digital marketing channels and enhancements to our website mostly offset the reductions in catalog related costs.\nFinancial Services Revenue - The following table sets forth the components of our Financial Services revenue for the years ended:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fee income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(64,167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63,831\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>(61,922\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,223\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net interest income, net of provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>274,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interchange income\n</td> <td>366,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other non-interest income\n</td> <td>3,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>369,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>352,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Customer rewards costs\n</td> <td>(214,445\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(212,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>430,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>375,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Services revenue increased $55 million, or 14.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in interest and fee income of $58 million was due to increases in credit card loans and the mix of credit card loans carrying interest, partially offset by lower rates in LIBOR. The provision for loan losses increased $19 million primarily due to growth in the average outstanding balance of credit card loans in 2014 compared to 2013. In addition, the provision for loan losses in 2013 was lower, in part, due to declining balances in our restructured loan portfolio, improvements in historical charge-off trends, and other performance data in this portfolio. The increase in interchange income of $22 million was primarily due to an increase in credit card purchases, partially offset by a decrease in the interchange rate. The decrease in other non-interest income was a result of the discontinuance of an identity theft program in 2013. The increase in credit card purchases also increased customer rewards costs, with such increase in 2014 compared to 2013 offset by the adjustment in the presentation of reimbursements between segments for certain promotional costs totaling $15 million for 2014. The impact of this reimbursement adjustment resulted in an increase in Financial Services revenue and an increase in merchandise cost of sales by the same amount. This presentation will be ongoing and had no impact on consolidated operating income or earnings per diluted share.\nThe following table sets forth the components of our Financial Services revenue as a percentage of average total credit card loans, including any accrued interest and fees, for the years ended:\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fee income\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interchange income\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-interest income\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer rewards costs\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services revenue\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe percentage of our merchandise sold to customers using the Cabela's CLUB Visa credit card approximated 30% for both 2014 and 2013.

The average balance of credit card loans increased to $3.9 billion, or 12.5%, for 2014 compared to 2013 due to increases in the number of active accounts and the average balance per account. We define an active credit card account as any account with an outstanding debit or credit balance at the end of any respective month during the past 12 months. The average number of active accounts increased to 1.8 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2013 due to our successful marketing efforts in new account acquisitions. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans decreased to 1.69% for 2014, down 11 basis points compared to 2013, due to improvements in the quality of our credit card portfolio evidenced by continued low delinquencies, an increase in recovery rates, and declining loan balances in our restructured loan portfolio.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue decreased $2 million in 2014 to $15 million compared to 2013 primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales revenue in 2014 compared to 2013.\nMerchandise Gross Profit\nComparisons and analysis of our gross profit on merchandising revenue are presented below for the years ended:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchandise sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,200,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,205,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,413\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchandise gross profit\n</td> <td>1,141,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,178,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37,112\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales\n</td> <td>35.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur merchandise gross profit decreased $37 million, or 3.1%, to $1.1 billion in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a decrease in sales of firearms and ammunition in 2014 compared to 2013.\nOur merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales decreased 110 basis points to 35.7% in 2014 from 36.8% in 2013. The decrease in the merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased sales discounts and markdowns, which had an impact of approximately 70 basis points, and to an adjustment in the presentation of reimbursement between segments for certain promotional costs totaling $15 million for 2014, which had an impact of approximately 50 basis points. The effect of this reimbursement adjustment resulted in an increase in Financial Services revenue and an increase in merchandise cost of sales by the same amount.

Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses increased primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas. We focused on expense management throughout the Company and implemented many expense reduction efforts that have shown benefits in 2014 and should continue to benefit operating income in upcoming periods. The most significant factors contributing to the changes in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 included:\n \u2022 an increase of $38 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and to the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores as well as corporate offices; \n \u2022 a decrease of $22 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation and our emphasis on operating expense management; \n \u2022 an increase of $20 million in advertising and promotional costs as we initiated our promotional activity earlier in the fourth quarter of 2014 in an effort to increase sales and to address pricing of competitors; and \n \u2022 an increase of $9 million in bad debt expense due to fraudulent transactions on the Cabela's CLUB credit card. \nSignificant changes in our selling, distribution, and administrative expenses related to specific business segments included the following:\nRetail Segment:\n \u2022 An increase of $26 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and to the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores. \n \u2022 An increase of $24 million in advertising and promotional costs. \n \u2022 An increase of $14 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to the opening of new retail stores.  Direct Segment:\n \u2022 A decrease of $20 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor in part related to our emphasis on operating expense management. \n \u2022 An increase of $20 million in advertising and promotional costs. \n \u2022 A decrease of $2 million in building costs and depreciation. \nFinancial Services Segment:\n \u2022 An increase of $9 million in bad debt expense due to fraudulent transactions on the Cabela's CLUB credit card. \n \u2022 An increase of $3 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor to support the growth of credit card operations. \n \u2022 A decrease of $1 million in advertising and promotional costs. \nCorporate Overhead, Distribution Centers, and Other:\n \u2022 A decrease of $19 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation and our emphasis on operating expense management. \n \u2022 An increase of $14 million in building costs primarily related to the operations and maintenance of our corporate office to support operational growth. \n \u2022 A decrease of $23 million in advertising and promotional costs primarily due to cost allocations between segments. \nImpairment and Restructuring Charges\nImpairment and restructuring charges consisted of the following for the years ended:\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment losses relating to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated amortization of deferred grant income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property, equipment, and other assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>937\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges for severance and related benefits\n</td> <td>641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2014 and 2013, we evaluated the recoverability of economic development bonds, property (including existing store locations and future retail store sites), equipment, goodwill, other property, and other intangible assets.\nOn June 11, 2014, we announced the transition to a third-party logistics provider for our distribution needs in Canada and the closing of our distribution center in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in March 2015. The third-party logistics provider began processing a portion of our Canada merchandise in a Calgary, Alberta, distribution center in October 2014. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2014 the Company recognized a restructuring charge related to employee severance agreements and termination benefits totaling approximately $1 million. This restructuring charge was recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment. We expected to incur approximately $2 million in additional incremental expenses related to the transition to this third-party logistics provider and the closing of our current distribution center in the first half of fiscal 2015.\nOn February 4, 2014, a United States district court (the Court\u201d) entered a judgment against the Company in the amount of $14 million relating to litigation regarding a breach of a retail store radius restriction. At December 28, 2013, pursuant to this judgment, we recognized a liability of $14 million, including an estimated amount for legal fees and costs, in our consolidated balance sheet. The recognition of this liability at December 28, 2013, resulted in the Company recording an increase to the carrying amount of the related retail store property through a reduction in deferred grant income by the amount repayable, plus legal and other costs. The cumulative additional depreciation that would have been recognized through December 28, 2013, as an expense in the absence of these grants was recognized in 2013 as depreciation expense. Therefore, the adjustment that reduced the deferred grant income of this retail store property at December 28, 2013, resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of $5 million in 2013, which was included in impairment and restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of income. This impairment loss was recognized in the Retail segment.\nOn March 21, 2014, through a supplemental judgment, the Court ordered that we pay interest in the amount of $1 million to the defendant. Therefore, our liability relating to this judgment increased in the first quarter of 2014 resulting in the Company recording an increase to the carrying amount of the related retail store property through a reduction in deferred grant income. The additional depreciation adjustment that reduced the deferred grant income of this retail store property resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $1 million that was recognized in the three months ended March 29, 2014. This increase in depreciation expense was included in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and was recognized in the Retail segment. There was no additional depreciation expense adjustment recognized after March 29, 2014. At December 27, 2014, this liability totaled $16 million.\nWe recognized an impairment loss totaling $1 million in 2013 related to the store closure of our former Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, retail site. The impairment loss of $1 million included leasehold improvement write-offs as well as lease cancellation and restoration costs. This impairment loss was recognized in the Retail and the Corporate Overhead and Other segments.\nOperating Income\nComparisons and analysis of operating income are presented below for the years ended:\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,966\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income by business segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,706\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>112,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44,510\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>111,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income as a percentage of segment revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Services\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income decreased $26 million, or 7.2%, in 2014 compared to 2013, and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased 80 basis points to 9.2% for 2014. The decreases in total operating income and total operating income as a percentage of total revenue were primarily due to an increase in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses, a decrease in revenue from our Direct business segment, and a decrease in our merchandise gross profit. These decreases to operating income were partially offset by increased operating income contributions from our Financial Services segment. Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas.\nUnder an Intercompany Agreement, the Financial Services segment pays to the Retail and Direct business segments a fixed license fee that includes 70 basis points on all originated charge volume of the Cabela's CLUB Visa credit card portfolio. In addition, among other items, the agreement requires the Financial Services segment to reimburse the Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs, which are recorded as a reduction to Financial Services segment revenue and as a reduction to merchandise costs associated with the Retail and Direct segments. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, this reimbursement from our Financial Services segment to our Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs has been adjusted to eliminate in consolidation. Prior periods have not been adjusted. Also, if the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB is greater than 13% at any quarter end, the Financial Services segment must pay an additional license fee to the Retail and Direct business segments equal to 50% of the amount that the total risk-based capital ratio exceeds 13%. At March 31, 2014, the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB exceeded this 13% threshold; therefore, an additional license fee of $11 million was paid in April 2014 by the Financial Services segment to the Retail segment ($7 million) and the Direct segment ($4 million). Total fees paid under the Intercompany Agreement by the Financial Services segment to these two segments, including the $11 million payment triggered by the excess total risk-based capital ratio provision, increased $20 million in 2014 compared to 2013; a $24 million increase to the Retail segment and a $4 million decrease to the Direct segment.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, was $22 million in both 2014 and 2013. The amount of interest capitalized increased to $8 million in 2014 compared to $4 million in 2013 primarily due to more stores opened. However, the increase in the amount of interest capitalized comparing the respective years was offset by additional interest expense recognized in 2014 associated with our uncertain tax positions and increases in interest expense due to higher outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility.\nOther Non-Operating Income, Net\nOther non-operating income was $5 million in 2014 compared to $4 million in 2013. This income is primarily from interest earned on our economic development bonds.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 36.7% in 2014 compared to 34.7% in 2013. The increase in our effective tax rate comparing the respective fiscal years is due to an increase of $4 million in accrued income tax related to tax adjustments attributable to changes in the mix of prior year taxable income between the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions and an increase in our state effective tax rate.\nAsset Quality of Cabela's CLUB\nDelinquencies and Non-Accrual\nWe consider the entire balance of an account, including any accrued interest and fees, delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date. Our aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which a customer has failed to make a required payment. As part of collection efforts, a credit card loan may be closed and placed on non-accrual or restructured in a fixed payment plan prior to charge-off. Our fixed payment plans require payment of the loan within 60 months and consist of a lower interest rate, reduced minimum payment, and elimination of fees. Loans on fixed payment plans include loans in which the customer has engaged a consumer credit counseling agency to assist them in managing their debt. Customers who miss two consecutive payments once placed on a payment plan or non-accrual will resume accruing interest at the rate they had accrued at before they were placed on a plan. Interest and fees are accrued in accordance with the terms of the applicable cardholder agreements or payment plan on credit card loans until the date of charge-off unless placed on non-accrual. Payments received on non-accrual loans are applied to principal and reduce the amount of the loan.\nThe quality of our credit card loan portfolio at any time reflects, among other factors: 1) the creditworthiness of cardholders, 2) general economic conditions, 3) the success of our account management and collection activities, and 4) the life-cycle stage of the portfolio. During periods of economic weakness, delinquencies and net charge-offs are more likely to increase. We have mitigated periods of economic weakness by selecting a customer base that is very creditworthy. We use the scores of Fair Isaac Corporation ( FICO\u201d), a widely-used financial metric for assessing an individual's credit rating, as the primary credit quality indicator. The median FICO score of our credit cardholders was 794 at the end of 2015 and 795 at the end of 2014.\nThe following table reports delinquencies, including any delinquent non-accrual and restructured credit card loans, as a percentage of our credit card loans, including any accrued interest and fees, in a manner consistent with our monthly external reporting for the years ended:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of days delinquent:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 30 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 60 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 90 days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDelinquencies increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due, in part, to generally challenging consumer conditions affecting payment rates as well as certain changes we made in our collection efforts on delinquent accounts. While our delinquency levels have increased compared to prior years, we believe our delinquency levels remained below industry averages at the end of 2015.\nThe table below shows delinquent, non-accrual, and restructured loans as a percentage of our credit card loans, including any accrued interest and fees, at the years ended:\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of days delinquent and still accruing (excludes non-accrual and restructured loans which are presented below):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 30 days\n</td> <td>0.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 60 days\n</td> <td>0.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 90 days\n</td> <td>0.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual loans\n</td> <td>0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructured loans\n</td> <td>0.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Charge-offs\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio. For information on the accounting policy, estimates, and assumptions relating to our allowance for loan losses on our credit card loan portfolio, please refer to Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d under the section titled Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nCharge-offs consist of the uncollectible principal, interest, and fees on a customer's account. Recoveries are the amounts collected on previously charged-off accounts, including such accounts that are sold to a third party. Most bankcard issuers charge off accounts at 180 days. We charge off credit card loans on a daily basis after an account becomes at a minimum 130 days contractually delinquent to allow us to manage the collection process more efficiently. Accounts relating to cardholder bankruptcies, cardholder deaths, and fraudulent transactions are charged off earlier.\nThe following table shows the activity in our allowance for loan losses and charge-off activity for the years ended:\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>85,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs\n</td> <td>(91,196\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76,868\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72,959\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoveries\n</td> <td>25,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs\n</td> <td>(65,781\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58,460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs on credit card loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(65,781\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58,460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs of accrued interest and fees (recorded as a reduction in interest and fee income)\n</td> <td>(10,065\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,093\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net charge-offs including accrued interest and fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(75,846\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66,553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63,152\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs, including accrued interest and fees, as a percentage of average credit card loans, including accrued interest and fees\n</td> <td>1.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased to 1.70% for 2015, up one basis point compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in loan delinquencies and a decrease in payment rates, partially offset by improvements in recovery rates. Recovery rates were positively impacted in 2015 due to a bulk sale of bankruptcy loans and acceleration of the timing of a sale of charged-off loans, which resulted in an 11 basis point reduction in the charge-off rate.\nAging of Credit Cards Loans Outstanding\nThe following table shows our credit card loans outstanding at the end of 2015 and 2014 segregated by the number of months passed since the accounts were opened.\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Loans Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loans Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Months Since Account Opened\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6 months or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7 - 12 months\n</td> <td>189,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>13 - 24 months\n</td> <td>428,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>410,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25 - 36 months\n</td> <td>464,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>37 - 48 months\n</td> <td>397,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>342,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>49 - 60 months\n</td> <td>363,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>61 - 72 months\n</td> <td>297,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>294,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>73 - 84 months\n</td> <td>308,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>More than 84 months\n</td> <td>2,449,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,130,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,104,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,472,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur Retail and Direct segments and our Financial Services segment have significantly differing liquidity and capital needs. We believe that we will have sufficient capital available from cash on hand, our revolving credit facility, and other borrowing sources to fund our cash requirements and near-term growth plans for at least the next 12 months. At the end of 2015 and 2014, cash on a consolidated basis totaled $315 million and $143 million, of which $157 million and $49 million, respectively, was cash at the Financial Services segment which is utilized to meet this segment's liquidity requirements. We evaluate the credit markets for securitizations and certificates of deposit to determine the most cost effective source of funds for the Financial Services segment. During 2015, the Financial Services segment issued certificates of deposit, completed term securitizations, and increased its variable funding facility. In 2016, the Financial Services segment intends to issue additional certificates of deposit and term securitizations. We believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund the Financial Services segment's foreseeable cash requirements, including maturities, and near-term growth plans.\nAs of January 2, 2016, cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $97 million. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the United States for capital expansion. The Company has not provided United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that the Company considers to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States as of the end of year 2015. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related United States tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of the year ended 2015, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $191 million. If those earnings were not considered indefinitely invested, the Company estimates that an additional income tax expense of approximately $44 million would be recorded. Based on our current projected capital needs and the current amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, we do not anticipate incurring any material tax costs beyond our accrued tax position in connection with any repatriation, but we may be required to accrue for unanticipated additional tax costs in the future if our expectations or the amount of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries change.\nRetail and Direct Segments - The primary cash requirements of our merchandising business relate to capital for new retail stores, purchases of inventory, investments in our management information systems and infrastructure, and general working capital needs. We historically have met these requirements with cash generated from our merchandising business operations, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, and by issuing debt and equity securities.\nThe cash flow we generate from our merchandising business is seasonal, with our peak cash requirements for inventory occurring from April through November. While we have consistently generated overall positive annual cash flow from our operating activities, other sources of liquidity are required by our merchandising business during these peak cash use periods. These sources historically have included short-term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to debt markets. While we generally have been able to manage our cash needs during peak periods, if any disruption occurred to our funding sources, or if we underestimated our cash needs, we would be unable to purchase inventory and otherwise conduct our merchandising business to its maximum effectiveness, which could result in reduced revenue and profits.\nOur credit agreement provides for an unsecured $775 million revolving credit facility and permits the issuance of letters of credit up to $75 million and swing line loans up to $30 million. The credit facility may be increased to $800 million subject to certain terms and conditions. The term of the credit facility expires on June 18, 2019. Advances under the credit facility will be used for the Company's general business purposes, including working capital support.\nOur unsecured $775 million revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes contain certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of minimum debt coverage, a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio, and a minimum consolidated net worth standard. In the event that we failed to comply with these covenants, a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable. At January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes. We anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes through at least the next 12 months.\nOn August 4, 2015, we entered into a note purchase agreement with various purchasers allowing us to issue and sell an aggregate of $550 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement to certain accredited investors. On August 4, 2015, we issued and sold under this note purchase agreement $250 million of senior unsecured notes with $100 million principal at 3.23% due August 4, 2020, $122 million principal at 3.70% due August 4, 2022, and $28 million principal at 4.01% due August 4, 2025. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually. On December 2, 2015, we issued and sold an additional $300 million of senior unsecured notes with $128 million principal at 3.82% due December 3, 2022, and $172 million principal at 4.11% due December 3, 2025. We have used the proceeds from this sale for general corporate purposes and intend to repay our existing unsecured notes for $215 million due February 27, 2016.\nWe have an unsecured $20 million Canadian (\"CAD\") revolving credit facility for our operations in Canada. Borrowings are payable on demand with interest payable monthly. The credit facility permits the issuance of letters of credit up to $10 million CAD in the aggregate, which reduce the overall credit limit available under the credit facility.\nIn April 2015, we announced our intent to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in open market transactions through February 2016. We completed the repurchase of our common stock under this authorization in August 2015 at a total cost of $100 million.\nOn September 1, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock over a two-year period. This authorization is in addition to the 2,000,000 share repurchase authorization approved in April 2015 and the standing annual authorization to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from equity-based awards issued under the Company's equity compensation plans. The timing and volume of share repurchases may be executed by the Company on a discretionary basis, or pursuant to trading plans, or other arrangements. Any share repurchase under this program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. This share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any outstanding shares of our common stock, and the program may be limited or terminated at any time. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that we will repurchase. The total amount of share repurchases that the Company can make in a year is limited to 75% of its prior year consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined, pursuant to a covenant requirement of its credit agreement. Under this authorization, we repurchased 1,989,305 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $74 million in 2015.\nFinancial Services Segment - The primary cash requirements of the Financial Services segment relate to the financing of credit card loans. These cash requirements will increase if our credit card originations increase or if our cardholders' balances or spending increase. The Financial Services segment sources operating funds in the ordinary course of business through various financing activities, which include funding obtained from securitization transactions, obtaining brokered and non-brokered certificates of deposit, borrowings under its federal funds purchase agreements, and cash generated from operations. During 2015, the Financial Services segment issued $352 million in certificates of deposit, completed two term securitizations totaling $775 million, and increased its $225 million variable funding facility originally scheduled to mature in March 2015 to $300 million and extended its maturity date to March 2018. We believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund the Financial Services segment's foreseeable cash requirements, including maturities, and near-term growth plans. The Trust has two $300 million term securitizations with expected principal payment due dates in June 2016 and October 2016. The principal payments are expected to be funded from restricted cash generated from credit card operations of the Trust.\nWFB is prohibited by regulations from lending money to Cabela's or other affiliates. WFB is subject to capital requirements imposed by Nebraska banking law and the Visa U.S.A., Inc. membership rules, and its ability to pay dividends is also limited by Nebraska and Federal banking law. If there are any disruptions in the credit markets, the Financial Services segment, like many other financial institutions, may increase its funding from certificates of deposit which may result in increased competition in the deposits market with fewer funds available or at unattractive rates. Our ability to issue certificates of deposit is reliant on our current regulatory capital levels. WFB is classified as a well-capitalized\u201d bank, the highest category under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. If WFB were to be classified as an adequately-capitalized\u201d bank, which is the next level category down from well-capitalized,\u201d we would be required to obtain a waiver from the FDIC in order to continue to issue certificates of deposit. We will invest additional capital in the Financial Services segment, if necessary, in order for WFB to continue to meet the minimum requirements for the well-capitalized\u201d classification under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. In addition to the non-brokered certificates of deposit market to fund growth and maturing securitizations, we have access to the brokered certificates of deposit market through multiple financial institutions for liquidity and funding purposes.\nEffective January 2015, WFB was subject to the interim final rules and the joint final rules adopted by the FDIC in July 2013 pertaining to the implementation of regulatory capital reforms recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010, and capital reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These rules revised the agencies' prompt corrective action framework by introducing a common equity tier 1 capital\u201d requirement and a higher minimum tier 1 capital\u201d requirement. The impact of the adoption of these rules was minimal to WFB.\nFor a discussion of other additional legislative and regulatory developments that pertain to the Financial Services segment, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Current Business Environment - Developments in Legislation and Regulation.\u201d\nOperating, Investing and Financing Activities\nThe following table presents changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended:\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>326,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(778,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,266,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(793,031\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>634,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>956,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>358,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 versus 2014\nOperating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities was $327 million in 2015, a net increase of $69 million compared to 2014. Comparing the respective years, we had a net increase of $84 million related to income taxes, as we paid a deposit of $50 million in 2014 for federal taxes related to prior period uncertain tax positions, a net increase of $50 million in inventories, and an increase of $23 million in provision for loan losses. The increase in inventories in 2015 was primarily due to the addition of new retail stores as inventory levels totaled $819 million at the end of 2015 compared to $760 million at the end of 2014.\nMostly offsetting these increases were net decreases of $32 million relating to accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to increases in inventories and in the number of retail stores; $25 million in other long-term liabilities due to changes related to prior period uncertain positions; $22 million in gift instruments, credit card rewards, and loyalty rewards programs due to increased volume; and $22 million in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nInvesting Activities - Cash used in investing activities decreased $488 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the use of $605 million in restricted cash of the Trust. Restricted cash of the Trust was used to repay $468 million of Series 2010-I and Series 2010-II notes in 2015 and totaled $41 million at January 2, 2016, compared to $335 million at December 27, 2014. Cash paid for property and equipment totaled $413 million in 2015 compared to $441 million in 2014. At January 2, 2016, the Company estimated it had total cash commitments of approximately $182 million outstanding for projected expenditures related to the development, construction, and completion of new retail stores. We expect to fund these estimated capital expenditures over the next 12 months with funds from operations and borrowings. In addition, we had a net decrease in cash of $142 million related to our credit card loan activity from outside sources.\nThe following table presents activity related to our retail stores for the years ended:\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid for property and equipment additions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of new retail stores opened during the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of retail stores at the end of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail square footage at the end of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,932,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,911,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing Activities - Cash provided by financing activities decreased $322 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This net change in cash was primarily due to an decrease in net borrowings on secured obligations of the Trust by the Financial Services segment of $659 million. Our Series 2010-I and Series 2010-II notes totaling $468 million were repaid in 2015 using restricted cash of the Trust, secured variable funding obligations totaling $480 million of the Trust were repaid, and $45 million in variable funding facilities was borrowed in 2014. We also had net decreases comparing the respective periods of $292 million in net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and $31 million in unpresented checks. Lastly, in 2015, we repurchased shares of our common stock at a cost of $174 million.\nThese decreases were partially offset by our issuance in 2015 of $550 million of senior unsecured notes and an increase of $337 million in time deposits compared to 2014, which the Financial Services segment utilizes as a source in funding its credit card operations. The Trust also issues variable funding facilities which are considered secured obligations backed by restricted credit card loans. At January 2, 2016, the Trust had three variable funding facilities with $1.1 billion in total capacity and $655 million outstanding.\nThe following table presents the borrowing activities of our merchandising business and the Financial Services segment for the years ended:\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings (repayments) on revolving credit facilities and inventory financing, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(172,015\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured obligations of the Trust, net of repayments\n</td> <td>366,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance (repayments) of long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>541,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,418\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings, net of repayments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>735,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,201,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our availability under the Company's debt and credit facilities, excluding the facilities of the Financial Services segment, at the years ended:\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts available for borrowing under credit facilities (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>795,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>795,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal amounts outstanding\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(180,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding letters of credit and standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>(20,246\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,064\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining borrowing capacity, excluding the Financial Services segment facilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>774,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>594,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Consists of our revolving credit facility of $775 million and our $20 million CAD credit facility (which for both years has not been translated into United States dollars). \nThe Financial Services segment also has total borrowing availability of $100 million under its agreements to borrow federal funds. At January 2, 2016, the entire $100 million of borrowing capacity was available.\nOur $775 million unsecured credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and other customary covenants, including:\n \u2022 a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined) of no less than 2.00 to 1 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters (as defined); \n \u2022 a leverage ratio (as defined) of no more than 3.00 to 1 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; and \n \u2022 a minimum consolidated net worth standard (as defined) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. \nIn addition, our unsecured senior notes contain various covenants and restrictions that are usual and customary for transactions of this type. Also, the debt agreements contain cross default provisions to other outstanding credit facilities. In the event that we failed to comply with these covenants, a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable. At January 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes. We anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes through the next 12 months.\n2014 versus 2013\nOperating Activities - Net cash provided from operating activities was $258 million in 2014 compared to $345 million in 2013. We paid a deposit of $50 million in 2014 for federal taxes related to prior period uncertain tax positions, which was the primary reason for the decrease of $71 million in the income tax accounts comparing the respective years. In addition, we had net decreases of $45 million in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to a timing difference in our Visa interchange funding for the Financial Services segment, $27 million in inventories, and $23 million in accounts receivable. Partially offsetting these decreases in cash from operating activities were increases of $80 million relating to accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to increases in inventories and in the number of retail stores, $20 million in gift instruments, credit card rewards, and loyalty rewards programs due to increased volume, and $20 million in depreciation and amortization. We increased inventory levels by $115 million at December 27, 2014, to $760 million, compared to 2013, where our inventory levels increased $92 million compared to year end 2012. The increase in inventories in 2014 was primarily due to the addition of new retail stores.\nInvesting Activities - Cash used in investing activities increased $473 million in 2014 to $1.3 billion compared to 2013. Cash paid for property and equipment additions totaled $441 million in 2014 compared to $333 million in 2013. We estimated we had total cash commitments at December 27, 2014, of approximately $524 million to be funded through the next 12 months for projected expenditures related to the development, construction, and completion of new retail stores, a new distribution center, and expansion of our corporate offices. In addition, we had decreases of $306 million related to the change in restricted cash of the Trust and $60 million related to our credit card loans originated from outside sources. Our restricted cash of the Trust totaled $335 million at December 27, 2014, as we repaid $255 million of Series 2010-I notes in full on January 15, 2015.\nFinancing Activities - Cash provided by financing activities increased $598 million in 2014 to $957 million compared to 2013. This net change was primarily due to an increase in net borrowings on secured obligations of the Trust by the Financial Services segment of $675 million. We also had increases of $185 million in net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and inventory financing. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $285 million relating to changes in time deposits.\nEconomic Development Bonds and Grants\nIn the past, we have negotiated economic development arrangements with many local and state governments relating to the construction of a number of our new retail stores, including free land, monetary grants, and the recapture of incremental sales, property, or other taxes through economic development bonds. Where appropriate, we intend to continue to utilize economic development arrangements with state and local governments to offset some of the construction costs and improve the return on investment of our new retail stores.\nEconomic Development Bonds - Economic development bonds are related to our government economic assistance arrangements relating to the construction of new retail stores or retail development. The payments of principal and interest on the bonds are typically tied to sales, property, or lodging taxes generated from the store and, in some cases, from businesses in the surrounding area, over periods which range between 15 and 30 years. Some of our bonds may be repurchased for par value by the governmental entity prior to the maturity date of the bonds. The governmental entity from which we purchase the bonds is not otherwise liable for repayment of principal and interest on the bonds to the extent that the associated taxes are insufficient to pay the bonds. If sufficient tax revenue is not generated by the subject properties, we will not receive scheduled payments and will be unable to realize the full value of the bonds carried on our consolidated balance sheet. There were no other than temporary fair value adjustments of economic development bonds and no adjustments of deferred grant income related to economic development bonds in 2015 or 2014. However, at the end of 2015, we identified economic development bonds totaling $20 million where the actual tax revenues associated with these properties were lower than previously projected. We will continue to closely monitor the amounts and timing of projected cash flows from the properties related to these economic development bonds. At January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014, economic development bonds totaled $84 million and $82 million, respectively.\nOn a quarterly basis, we perform various procedures to analyze the amounts and timing of projected cash flows to be received from our economic development bonds. Please refer to Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the section entitled Economic Development Bonds\u201d for information on our procedures used to analyze the amounts and timing of projected cash flows to be received from our economic development bonds.\nGrants - Historically, we have received grant funding in exchange for commitments made by us to the state or local government providing the funding. The commitments, such as assurance of agreed employment and wage levels at our retail stores or that the retail store will remain open, typically phase out over approximately five to ten years. If we fail to maintain the commitments during the applicable period, the funds we received may have to be repaid or other adverse consequences may arise, which could affect our cash flows and profitability. The total amount of grant funding subject to a specific contractual remedy was $43 million at both January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014. At January 2, 2016, we had recorded $17 million in the consolidated balance sheets relating to these grants with $16 million in current liabilities and $1 million in long-term liabilities. At December 27, 2014, we had recorded $23 million in current liabilities.\nSecuritization of Credit Card Loans\nThe Financial Services segment historically has funded most of its growth in credit card loans through an asset securitization program. The Financial Services segment utilizes the Trust for the purpose of routinely securitizing credit card loans and issuing beneficial interest to investors. The Trust issues variable funding facilities and long-term notes (collectively referred to herein as secured obligations of the Trust\u201d), each of which has an undivided interest in the assets of the Trust. The Financial Services segment must retain a minimum 20 day average of 5% of the loans in the securitization trust which ranks pari passu with the investors' interests in the Trust. In addition, the Financial Services segment owns notes issued by the Trust from some of the securitizations, which in some cases may be subordinated to other notes issued. The Financial Services segment's retained interests are eliminated upon consolidation of the Trust. The consolidated assets of the Trust are subject to credit, payment, and interest rate risks on the transferred credit card loans. The credit card loans of the Trust are restricted for the repayment of the secured obligations of the Trust.\nTo protect the holders of the secured obligations of the Trust (the investors\u201d), the securitization structures include certain features that could result in earlier-than-expected repayment of the securities, which could cause the Financial Services segment to sustain a loss of one or more of its retained interests and could prompt the need to seek alternative sources of funding. The primary investor protection feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of loans to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. The Financial Services segment refers to this as the early amortization feature. Investors are allocated cash flows derived from activities related to the accounts comprising the securitized pool of loans, the amounts of which reflect finance charges collected, certain fee assessments collected, allocations of interchange, and recoveries on charged off accounts. These cash flows are considered to be restricted under the governing documents to pay interest to investors, servicing fees, and to absorb the investor's share of charge-offs occurring within the securitized pool of loans. Any cash flows remaining in excess of these requirements are reported to investors as excess spread. An excess spread of less than zero percent for a contractually specified period, generally a three-month average, would trigger an early amortization event. Such an event could result in the Financial Services segment incurring losses related to its retained interests. In addition, if the retained interest in the loans of the Financial Services segment falls below the 5% minimum 20 day average and the Financial Services segment fails to add new accounts to the securitized pool of loans, an early amortization event would be triggered.\nAnother feature, which is applicable to the secured obligations of the Trust, is one in which excess cash flows generated by the transferred loans are held at the Trust for the benefit of the investors. This cash reserve account funding is triggered when the three-month average excess spread rate of the Trust decreases to below 4.50% with increasing funding requirements as excess spread levels decline below preset levels or as contractually required by the governing documents. Similar to early amortization, this feature also is designed to protect the investors' interests from loss, thus making the cash restricted. Upon scheduled maturity or early amortization of a securitization, the Financial Services segment is required to remit principal payments received on the securitized pool of loans to the Trust which are restricted for the repayment of the investors' principal note. The investors have no recourse to the Financial Services segment's other assets for failure of debtors to pay other than for breaches of certain customary representations, warranties, and covenants. These representations, warranties, covenants, and the related indemnities do not protect the Trust or third party investors against credit-related losses on the loans.\nThe total amounts and

and will continue to be, particularly reliant on funding from securitization transactions for the Financial Services segment. A failure to renew existing facilities or to add additional capacity on favorable terms as it becomes necessary could increase our financing costs and potentially limit our ability to grow the business of the Financial Services segment. Unfavorable conditions in the asset-backed securities markets generally, including the unavailability of commercial bank liquidity support or credit enhancements, could have a similar effect. In 2015, the Financial Services segment completed two term securitizations totaling $775 million and increased its $225 million variable funding facility originally scheduled to mature in March 2015 to $300 million and extended its maturity date to March 2018. In 2016, the Financial Services segment intends to issue additional certificates of deposit and term securitizations. We believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund the Financial Services segment's foreseeable cash requirements, including maturities, and near-term growth plans.\nFurthermore, the securitized credit card loans of the Financial Services segment could experience poor performance, including increased delinquencies and credit losses, lower payment rates, or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds. This could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in the Financial Services segment's securitization transactions, cause early amortization of these securities, or result in higher required credit enhancement levels. Credit card loans performed within established guidelines and no events which could trigger an early amortization occurred during the years ended January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014.\nCertificates of Deposit\nThe Financial Services segment utilizes brokered and non-brokered certificates of deposit to partially finance its operating activities. The Financial Services segment issues certificates of deposit in a minimum amount of one hundred thousand dollars in various maturities. At January 2, 2016, the Financial Services segment had $880 million of certificates of deposit outstanding with maturities ranging from January 2016 to July 2023 and with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 2.23%. This outstanding balance compares to $806 million at December 27, 2014, with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 2.25%. For a summary schedule of the contractual maturities of our certificates of deposit for the last two years, please refer to Note 10 Time Deposits\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three years. We cannot assure, however, that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following tables provide

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement\nOperating Leases - We lease various items of office equipment and buildings. Rent expense for these operating leases is recorded in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Future obligations are shown in the preceding contractual obligations table.\nCredit Card Limits - The Financial Services segment bears off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of its business. One form of this risk is through the Financial Services segment's commitment to extend credit to cardholders up to the maximum amount of their credit limits. The aggregate of such potential funding requirements totaled $35 billion above existing balances at the end of 2015. These funding obligations are not included in our consolidated balance sheet. While the Financial Services segment has not experienced, and does not anticipate that it will experience, a significant draw down of unfunded credit lines by its cardholders, such an event would create a cash need at the Financial Services segment which likely could not be met by our available cash and funding sources. The Financial Services segment has the right to reduce or cancel these available lines of credit at any time.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Cabela's Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates and assumptions. Our estimation processes contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to make these estimates. Should actual results be different than our estimates, we could be exposed to gains or losses from differences that may be material.\nFor a summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the accounting policies discussed below represent accounting policies we apply that are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements.\nMerchandise Revenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized on our Direct sales when merchandise is delivered to the customer with the point of delivery based on our estimate of shipping time from our distribution centers to the customer. We recognize reserves for estimated product returns based upon our historical return experience and expectations. Had our estimate of merchandise in-transit to customers and our estimate of product returns been different by 10% at the end of 2015, our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately $1 million. Sales of gift instruments are recorded in merchandise revenue when the gift instruments are redeemed in exchange for merchandise or services and as a liability prior to redemption. We recognize breakage on gift instruments as revenue when the probability of redemption is remote. Had our estimate of breakage on our recorded liability for gift instruments been different by 10% of the recorded liability at the end of 2015, our merchandise revenue would have been higher or lower by approximately $1 million.\nInventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market. All inventories are finished goods. We estimate the provision for inventory shrinkage based on our historical inventory accuracy rates as determined by periodic and annual cycle counts. The provision for damaged goods from returns is based upon our historical experience. We estimate provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on historical loss, specific identification, product performance statistics, and future merchandising objectives. Had our estimated inventory reserves been different by 10% at the end of 2015, our cost of sales would have been higher or lower by approximately $2 million.\nAllowance for Loan Losses on Credit Cards - The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses and is evaluated by management for adequacy. The measurement of the overall allowance is subject to estimation risk, and the amount of actual losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts. For example, had management's estimate of net losses over the next 12 months been different by 10% at the end of 2015, the Financial Services segment's allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses would have changed by approximately $8 million.\nLong-Lived Assets - Long-lived assets other than goodwill and other intangible assets, which generally are tested separately for impairment on an annual basis, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The calculation for an impairment loss compares the carrying value of the asset to that asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future discounted cash flows, observable market prices, or unobservable market prices. We recognize an impairment loss if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Frequently our impairment loss calculations contain multiple uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting cash flows under different scenarios. We have consistently applied our accounting methodologies that we use to assess impairment loss. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.\nEconomic Development Bonds - On a quarterly basis, we revalue our economic development bonds and evaluate the projected underlying cash flows to determine if the carrying amount of such economic development bonds can be recovered. To the extent the expected cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, the bonds are assessed for impairment. Deficiencies in projected discounted cash flows below the recorded carrying amount of the economic development bonds evidences that we do not expect to recover the cost basis. Consequently, the valuation results in an other than temporary impairment. Had our fair value estimates been lower by 10% at the end of 2015, the value of economic development bonds would have been approximately $8 million less with the unrealized loss reflected in comprehensive income if the loss was deemed to be temporary. Any declines in the fair value of available-for-sale economic development bonds below cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses.\nThere were no other than temporary fair value adjustments of economic development bonds and no adjustments of deferred grant income related to economic development bonds in 2015. However, at the end of 2015, we identified economic development bonds with carrying values of $20 million where the actual tax revenues associated with these properties were lower than previously projected. We will continue to closely monitor the amounts and timing of projected cash flows from the properties related to these economic development bonds.\nIncome Taxes - Income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which we operate and require significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for based on these assessments. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements based on an evaluation of new information. We have not provided United States income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States as of the end of 2015. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related United States tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. We have reserved for potential adjustments to the provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 2 Accounting Pronouncements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.

Revenues for 2015 totaled $4.0 billion, an increase of $350 million, or 9.6%, compared to 2014, due to increases in total merchandise sales of $280 million and Financial Services revenue of $72 million.\nTotal merchandise sales increased $280 million, or 8.7%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The most significant factors contributing to the net increase in total merchandise sales comparing 2015 to 2014 included the following:\n \u2022 The impact of the 53rd week in 2015 resulted in an increase in merchandise sales of $84 million. \n \u2022 Retail revenue increased $321 million in 2015 compared to 2014 from the addition of new retail stores. \n \u2022 Comparable store sales on a consolidated basis decreased $75 million, or 3.4%, compared to 2014. Comparable store sales results for our stores in the United States, which exclude Canada results and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, decreased 2.2% compared to 2014 mostly due to overall decreases in the clothing and footwear product category. We have seen continued softness in this category as our fall and winter apparel and footwear products were met with unseasonably warm weather across most of our major markets. The decrease in the clothing and footwear product category was partially offset by an increase of approximately $11 million in the general outdoors and hunting equipment product categories with neither of these two categories disproportionately impacting the year over year change more than the other category. The decrease in comparable store sales comparing 2015 to 2014 was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 6.2% partially offset by an increase in the average sales per transaction of 4.4%. \n \u2022 Adjusted for 52 weeks, Direct revenue decreased $45 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to decreases extending across all major product categories attributable to decreases in the \n \u2022 clothing and footwear product category of approximately 51%. \n \u2022 hunting equipment product category of approximately 37%, and \n \u2022 general outdoors product category of approximately 12%. \nA significant factor in the decrease in our clothing and footwear product category was the negative impact that the unseasonably warm weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 had on sales of fall and winter apparel and footwear. The decrease in the hunting equipment product category was due mostly to a shift in ammunition sales from the Direct segment to the Retail segment.\nFinancial Services revenue increased $72 million, or 16.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in Financial Services revenue was primarily due to an increase in interest and fee income due to increases in credit card loans and the revolving rate and an increase in interchange income due to increases in credit card purchases and the interchange rate. Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in the provision for loan losses due primarily to growth in the average outstanding balance of credit card loans and, to a lesser extent, increases in loan delinquencies.\nFor fiscal year 2016, we intend to continue to monitor and take steps that are needed to respond to any number of consumer-related factors that may impact our planned growth in comparable store sales on an annual basis. These steps may include the timing of discounts offered and promotional events to meet consumer preferences or actions taken by our competitors, including demand for firearms and ammunition, which can be very volatile based on current events as well as potential future government regulation. In addition, we will also look at our strategic space allocation and improve space utilization within our stores, as well as changing our brand assortment between national brands and Cabela's brand. We also are working closely with our vendors and actively managing our inventory levels to ensure that we have the adequate quantity and assortment of necessary products available to meet any such consumer-related factors.\nOur merchandise gross profit increased $53 million, or 4.7%, to $1.2 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to new retail store growth. Our merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales decreased 140 basis points to 34.3% in 2015 from 35.7% in 2014 due to our markdown and pricing strategy and, to a lesser extent, increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories. The impact of the decrease due to markdown and pricing strategy was disproportionately higher than the change due to increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories.\nOperating income decreased $28 million, or 8.2%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased 150 basis points to 7.7% in 2015 compared to 9.2% in 2014. The decrease in total operating income was due to increases in consolidated operating expenses and impairment and restructuring charges and a decrease in revenue from our Direct segment. Net increases in revenue from our Retail and Financial Services segments and an increase in our merchandise gross profit partially offset the decrease in total operating income.\nOperating expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of retail stores and costs in related support areas and due to an increase in incentive compensation in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2014, we did not incur any incentive compensation expense. Impairment and restructuring charges increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to (i) impairment losses totaling $10 million relating to the write-off of costs pertaining to previously identified store sites and the write-down to fair value of certain land properties and (ii) a $6 million charge for severance and related benefits due to a corporate office restructure and reduction in the number of personnel.\nIn the second half of 2015, we launched a major multi-year corporate restructuring project aimed at lowering the Company's operating expense base to increase our return on invested capital. We have identified numerous meaningful savings opportunities across the Company, including information technology process improvement, indirect procurement, retail labor optimization, merchandise sourcing, retail support functions, and supply chain enhancements, some of which we have already implemented, that are expected to result in a reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue by 75 to 150 basis points over the next three years. As we focus on expense management controls consistent with our multi-year corporate restructuring project, we plan to continue our omni-channel initiatives, our Cabela's branded product investments, and our retail expansion, with current plans to open eight stores in 2016. We will continue to manage our operating costs accordingly through fiscal 2016.\nFiscal 2015 consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal 2014 consisted of 52 weeks. The table below presents results for 2015 excluding the effect of revenue earned in the last week of 2015 in order to show comparable data with 2014 and reconciles our presentation of total revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) to the non-GAAP presentation excluding the 53rd week results. Management believes these non-GAAP financial results provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding revenues and trends and performance of our ongoing operations and are useful for year-over-year comparisons of such results. In addition, management evaluates results using non-GAAP adjusted total revenue. These non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP. Financial Services was not adjusted because its reporting periods end on a calendar year.\n\nThe impact of the 53rd week in 2015 was to increase total revenue and revenue from our merchandising businesses by $84 million. Adjusting to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014, revenues for 2015 totaled $3.9 billion, an increase of 7.3% compared to 2014, and revenue in our merchandising business for 2015 increased $197 million, or 6.1%, compared to 2014. The net increase in total merchandise sales comparing 2015 to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from new stores opened during 2015, partially offset by decreases in comparable store sales and Direct revenue.\nThe following summarizes the operating results of our three business segments. For a more detailed discussion, see Results of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\u201d.\nRetail segment results for 2015 compared to 2014 were as follows:\n \u2022 revenue increased $308 million, or 13.1% (adjusted to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014, revenue increased$242 million, or 10.3%); \n \u2022 operating income increased $7 million, or 1.7%; \n \u2022 operating income as a percentage of Retail segment revenue decreased 180 basis points to 16.0%; and \n \u2022 comparable store sales on a consolidated basis decreased 3.4%, and for our United States locations decreased 2.2%, both percentages adjusted to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014.  The stores we opened in 2015 did not meet our sales and profitability expectations so we are slowing new store growth over the next two years as we address retail store performance and productivity. For 2016, we plan to open eight new stores with total retail square footage of approximately 600,000, which is over 7% annual square footage growth compared to the end of 2015.\nIn September 2015, we began operations in our new 600,000 square foot distribution center in Tooele, Utah, which will help to support our growth. In November 2015, we opened a 98,000 square foot distribution center located in Puyallup, Washington, which is near Tacoma, Washington. This leased facility allowed us to eliminate third party warehousing services on the west coast in January 2016 and to timely prioritize in-bound international freight destined for our inland distribution centers and stores, which will increase our internal service levels and deliver our products throughout our network more efficiently. In March 2015, we closed our distribution center in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, as our merchandise needs in Canada are now processed by a third-party logistics provider through a leased facility in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nDirect segment results for 2015 compared to 2014 were as follows:\n \u2022 revenue decreased $28 million, or 3.3% (adjusted to be on a comparable 52-week year with 2014, revenue decreased$45 million, or 5.3%); \n \u2022 operating income decreased $30 million, or 26.4%; and \n \u2022 operating income as a percentage of Direct segment revenue decreased 310 basis points to 10.1%.  Cabela's CLUB continues to manage credit card delinquencies and charge-offs below industry average by adhering to our conservative underwriting criteria and active account management. Comparing Cabela's CLUB results for 2015 to 2014:\n \u2022 Financial Services revenue increased $72 million, or 16.8%; \n \u2022 the average number of active accounts increased 6.8% to 1.9 million, and the average balance per active account increased $134; \n \u2022 the average balance of our credit card loans increased 13.4% to $4.5 billion; \n \u2022 net purchases on credit card accounts increased 6.0% to $20.2 billion; and \n \u2022 net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased one basis point to 1.70%. \nIn 2015, the Financial Services segment issued $352 million in certificates of deposit, completed two term securitizations totaling $775 million, and increased a $225 million variable funding facility originally scheduled to mature in March 2015 to $300 million and extended its maturity date to March 2018.\nVision 2020\nOur vision is to be the world's best omni-channel retailer by creating intense loyalty for our outdoor brand through the legendary products and customer service delivered by our highly trained outfitters.\nGame Plan for Growth. Central to Vision 2020 is our Game Plan for Growth.\u201d We see the potential to continue taking market share in the fragmented outdoor market, while growing organically through customer loyalty and by providing rich customer experiences in every business channel. By embracing the diverse nature of the outdoor marketplace, and regional preferences, we will be able to capitalize on the best of both traditions and trends in outfitting our customers. This means bringing customers quality products that allow them to enjoy the outdoor traditions that bring them closer to nature, and family and friends - while meeting their expectations for great values and the latest products that make their outdoors pursuits more productive and enjoyable.\nThe Game Plan for Growth is defined by two strategies: Focus on the Core and Foremost Advantage.\nFocus on the Core - Focus on the Core will concentrate investment and resources to the categories customers most identify with Cabela's, and where customers demand the most from us in product selection, availability, and expertise - Hunting, Fishing, Camping, and Shooting Sports.\nForemost Advantage - Based on our heritage as the World's Foremost Outfitter, the Foremost Advantage aligns business strategies to a framework developed with over 50 years of deep customer insights. This framework will drive revenue and shareholder returns by focusing on our customers and is defined by four areas: Experience, Expertise, Excellent Value and Exceptional Products.\n \u2022 Experience - Engaging customers with rich, relevant experiences in every channel to drive a cycle of repeat visits and sales growth. \n \u2022 Expertise - Proving to customers that we are the foremost outdoor experts in the retail industry by offering end-use knowledge and experience that is trusted above all others. \n \u2022 Excellent Value - Winning customer loyalty and increasing customer purchases with the value propositions we create. \n \u2022 Exceptional Products - Offering products that meet customer demands in quality and performance.  Strategic Focus Areas\nVision 2020 and the Growth Game Plan are anchored by six strategic focus areas that will ensure winning results by defining measurable objectives and aligning strategies across the enterprise:\n \u2022 Improve Top-Line Sales \n \u2022 Increase Bottom-Line Profits \n \u2022 Retail Store Expansion and Innovation \n \u2022 Customers First \n \u2022 Focus on All Outfitters \n \u2022 Grow the CLUB  Improve Top-Line Sales - We believe smarter assortments and better floor space utilization will continue improving retail comparable store sales. Our retail merchandise performance will also be supported by focusing on the core categories of our business, while delivering top national brands, excellent values, and exceptional products for our customers. Our Direct business is poised to continue making improvements to the omni-channel customer experience and support total sales by investments in revenue-driving digital programs that support wins across both the Retail and Direct businesses.\nIncrease Bottom-Line Profits - Our leadership is focused on driving rigor into the business to rapidly advance business maturity, while committing to a continuous improvement culture and earning the right to be a test and learn company. We are also aggressively transforming our business by adopting leading practices to drive revenue, leverage expenses, gain competitive advantage, and increase profitability in all business units.\nRetail Store Expansion and Innovation - We believe it is imperative to continue innovating how we select, design, and build our retail stores, while applying best-in-class omni-channel retail practices to improve customer experience and reduce expenses from groundbreaking to grand opening. Ongoing efforts are using learnings from our legacy in destination retail, our extensive internal customer analytics capabilities, and relationships with external partners and industry leaders to triangulate solutions that will satisfy customers and shareholders.\nCustomers First - Our founders believed customer service was the centerpiece of every Cabela's experience. We have pro-staff programs connecting influential industry leaders and local experts with Cabela's customers in our retail stores. Our hunters' education programs are proactively working to reduce a national shortage of hunters' education instructors with a grassroots effort centered in our stores and led by our outfitters. We are also partnering with top brands to increase sales by providing more customer service and expertise in retail stores, without increasing expenses. We have made it easier and simpler than ever before for customers to complete an order online on any device, check inventory availability at their local stores, and connect to Cabela's on all types of social media. Multiple channel order delivery capabilities also allow us to optimize delivery expectations for customers while minimizing transportation costs. We have the capability to deliver distribution center to customer, retail store to customer, vendor to customer, in-store-pickup from retail store inventory, and in-store-pickup from distribution center inventory.\nFocus on All Outfitters - Promoting diversity across the business, and building an employee base of outfitters that hails from across the country is a key component of Vision 2020. Our leadership believes in embracing people of all backgrounds and viewpoints, because there is greater value in multiple perspectives and varied experiences. We call all our employees outfitters\u201d for good reason. Every outfitter that interacts with a customer needs outdoor expertise, whether they are working at a cash register or building a webpage. This makes providing opportunities for outfitters to enjoy the outdoor lifestyle a priority. We accomplish this through work-life balance, discount programs, and opportunities to learn first-hand about core outdoor pursuits.\nGrow the CLUB - We must continue to foster and promote the close relationship between the merchandising business and Cabela's CLUB. Our efforts lead to perennial increases in cardholders through organic growth and retail store expansion in the United States. This close partnership between the merchandising business and Cabela's CLUB also allows our tiered loyalty programs to increase average balances of credit card loans and total credit card loans outstanding on an annual basis.\nCurrent Business Environment\nMacroeconomic Environment - In 2015, we experienced a challenging consumer environment across all business channels. To address these issues, we increased our promotional activity, adjusted our marketing spending, and implemented operating expense controls to levels consistent with how our business was performing. In addition, during the last half of 2015, we launched a major multi-year corporate restructuring project aimed at lowering the Company's operating expenses. The Financial Services segment continues to monitor developments in the securitization and certificates of deposit markets to ensure adequate access to liquidity. We expect our charge-off rates and delinquency levels to remain below industry averages.\nDevelopments in Legislation and Regulation - Since the latter part of 2012, there has been significant discussion regarding enacted gun control legislation and potential gun control legislation, primarily aimed at modern sporting rifles, certain semiautomatic pistols, and high capacity magazines. For example, the States of Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, and New York have enacted legislation that prohibits the sale of certain high capacity magazines and, in some cases, the sale of certain firearms. We do not expect this state legislation to have a significant impact on our business. We are a federally licensed firearm dealer that conducts required background checks on prospective firearms purchasers. As such, we do not expect the executive action announced in January 2016 regarding background checks for all purchases of firearms to have a significant impact on our business. Any new federal legislation that prohibits the sale of certain modern sporting rifles, semiautomatic pistols, or ammunition could negatively impact our hunting equipment sales.\nPursuant to certain liquidity requirements under the interim final rules and the joint final rules implemented under the regulatory capital reforms recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (referred to as Basel III\u201d), the noteholders under two of the variable funding facilities issued under WFB's securitization program have requested and obtained amendments to their respective transaction documents. In one case, the amendments permit the noteholders to delay funding an advance requested under that facility for up to 35 days. In the other case, the amendments require WFB to provide 35 days' prior notice in connection with requests for certain advances. These changes and any similar changes requested by the noteholders under any other variable funding facility could delay or disrupt access to funding under the variable funding facilities. Moreover, the liquidity requirements under Basel III could result in an increase in the borrowing costs under the variable funding facilities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act\u201d) was signed into law in July 2010 and has made extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and credit rating agencies and requires significant rule-making. The changes resulting from the Reform Act may impact our profitability, require changes to certain Financial Services segment business practices, impose upon the Financial Services segment more stringent capital, liquidity, and leverage ratio requirements, increase the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's ( FDIC\u201d) deposit insurance premiums, or otherwise adversely affect the Financial Services segment's business. These changes may also require the Financial Services segment to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes.\nThe Reform Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the Bureau\u201d) within the Federal Reserve, a new federal consumer protection regulator. The Bureau has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings, and payment services and products, and WFB is subject to its regulation. While the Bureau does not currently examine WFB, it receives information from the FDIC, WFB's primary regulator. The Bureau also has rulemaking and interpretive authority under existing and future consumer financial services laws. The Bureau is specifically authorized to issue rules identifying as unlawful acts or practices it defines as unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices\u201d in connection with a consumer or in connection with a consumer financial product or service.\nThe Bureau, the FDIC, and other agencies have recently announced several high-profile enforcement actions against credit card issuers for deceptive marketing and other illegal practices related to the advertising of ancillary products, collection practices, and other matters. By these recent public enforcement actions, the Bureau and the FDIC have signaled a heightened scrutiny of credit card issuers. Across the industry, we anticipate increased activity by regulators in pursuing consumer protection claims going forward.\nSeveral rules and regulations have been proposed or adopted that may substantially affect issuers of asset-backed securities. On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) approved joint final regulations implementing the provisions of the Reform Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule.\u201d Generally, the Volcker Rule and the implementing regulations prohibit any banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund, subject to exemptions for certain permitted activities. These regulations limit our ability to engage in the types of transactions covered by the Volcker Rule, and may impose compliance, monitoring, and reporting obligations on us and WFB under certain circumstances. Although the effective date of the regulations is April 1, 2014, the Federal Reserve approved an extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2016, and has announced its intention to further extend the conformance period until July 21, 2017. We are continuing to assess the impact, if any, that the Volcker Rule and the implementing regulation will have on our Retail, Direct, and Financial Services segments, but we do not expect the Volcker Rule to have a material impact on WFB's securitization program.\nThe Cabela's Master Credit Card Trust and related entities (collectively referred to as the Trust\u201d) is structured to qualify for the exemption from the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act\u201d) provided by Investment Company Act Rule 3a-7. On August 31, 2011, the SEC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible amendments to Investment Company Act Rule 3a-7. At this time, it is uncertain what form the related proposed and final rules will take, whether the Trust would continue to be eligible to rely on the exemption provided by Investment Company Act Rule 3a-7, and whether the Trust would qualify for any other Investment Company Act exemption.\nOn August 27, 2014, the SEC adopted certain rules ( SEC Regulation AB II\u201d) that will change the disclosure, reporting, and offering process for public offerings of asset-backed securities, including those issued under WFB's securitization program. SEC Regulation AB II had been originally proposed by the SEC on April 7, 2010, and was reproposed by the SEC on July 26, 2011. Among other things, SEC Regulation AB II imposes as a condition for the shelf registration of asset-backed securities the filing of a certification concerning the disclosure contained in the prospectus and the design of the securitization at the time of each offering off the shelf and the appointment of a credit risk manager to review assets when credit enhancement requirements are not met or at the direction of investors. As originally proposed and re-proposed, SEC Regulation AB II would have required the disclosure of group-level data regarding the receivables in a credit card securitization, but this requirement was not included in the final rule as adopted. There can be no assurances that the SEC will not require disclosure of group-level data in credit card securitizations in the future. We are continuing to assess the impact of SEC Regulation AB II on WFB's securitization program.\nOn October 22, 2014, pursuant to the provisions of the Reform Act, the FDIC, the SEC, the Federal Reserve, and certain other federal agencies adopted regulations that impose a five percent risk retention requirement for credit card securitizations that are issued after December 2016. We have not determined whether WFB's existing forms of risk retention will satisfy the regulatory requirements, whether structural changes will be necessary, or whether the risk retention requirement will impact the Financial Services segment's ability or desire to continue to rely on the securitization market for funding.\nOn September 19, 2011, the SEC proposed a new rule under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to implement certain provisions of the Reform Act. Under the proposed rule, an underwriter, placement agent, initial purchaser, or sponsor of an asset-backed security, or any affiliate of any such person, shall not at any time within one year after the first closing of the sale of the asset-backed security engage in any transaction that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest with respect to any investor in a transaction arising out of such activity. The proposed rule would exempt certain risk mitigating hedging activities, liquidity commitments, and bona fide market-making activity. It is not clear how the final rule will differ from the proposed rule, if at all. The final rule's impact on the securitization market and the Financial Services segment is also unclear at this time.\nOperations Review\nOur operating results expressed as a percentage of revenue were as follows for the years ended:\n\nResults of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues\nRetail revenue includes sales realized and customer services performed at our retail stores, sales from orders placed through our retail store Internet kiosks, and sales from customers utilizing our in-store pick-up program. Direct revenue includes Internet and call center (catalog) sales from orders placed through our website, over the phone, and by mail where the merchandise is shipped through our omni-channel fulfillment process to our customers at locations of their choice. Retail and Direct revenue also includes sales from the redemption of loyalty points earned by Cabela's CLUB Visa cardholders of our Financial Services segment. Financial Services revenue is comprised of interest and fee income, interchange income, other non-interest income, interest expense, provision for loan losses, and customer rewards costs from our credit card operations. Other revenue sources include the value of unredeemed points earned that are associated with the Company's loyalty rewards programs for Cabela's CLUB issued credit cards, net of the estimated costs of the points; fees for hunting and fishing outfitter services; fees from a full-service travel agency business; real estate rental income and land sales; and other complementary business services.\nOur retail stores are included in our distribution network through the omni-channel fulfillment process. Therefore, we ship products to our customers from both our distribution centers and our retail stores, so customers who order through our call centers or website are not solely dependent upon the stock we have in our distribution centers.\nComparisons and analysis of our revenues are presented below for the years ended:\n\nProduct Sales Mix - The following table sets forth the percentage of our merchandise revenue contributed by major product categories for our Retail and Direct segments and in total for the years ended:\n\nThe hunting equipment merchandise category includes a wide variety of firearms, ammunition, optics, archery products, and related accessories and supplies. The general outdoors merchandise category includes a full range of equipment and accessories supporting all outdoor activities, including all types of fishing and tackle products, boats and marine equipment, camping gear and equipment, food preparation and outdoor cooking products, all-terrain vehicles and accessories for automobiles and all-terrain vehicles, and gifts and home furnishings. The clothing and footwear merchandise category includes fieldwear apparel and footwear, sportswear, casual clothing and footwear, and workwear products.\nRetail Revenue - Retail revenue increased $308 million, or 13.1%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase of $321 million in revenue from the addition of new retail stores. The 53rd week in 2015 increased Retail revenue by $66 million; therefore, adjusted for 52 weeks, Retail revenue increased $242 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\nThe increase in retail revenue from new retail stores was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of $75 million. A store is included in our comparable store sales base on the first day of the month following the fifteen month anniversary of 1) its opening or acquisition, or 2) any changes to retail store space greater than 25% of total square footage of the store.\nComparable store sales and analysis are presented below for the years ended:\n\n (1) Excludes the 53rd week in 2015 to present on a comparable 52-week basis. \n (2) Reflects the elimination of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. \nComparable store sales on a consolidated basis decreased $75 million, or 3.4%, compared to 2014. Comparable store sales results for our stores in the United States, which exclude Canada results and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, decreased 2.2% compared to 2014 mostly due to overall decreases in the clothing and footwear product category. The decrease in the clothing and footwear product category was partially offset by an increase of approximately $11 million in the general outdoors and hunting equipment product categories with neither of these two categories disproportionately impacting the year over year change more than the other category.\nWe have seen continued softness in our apparel categories as our fall and winter assortments were met with unseasonably warm weather across most of our major markets. The decrease in comparable store sales comparing 2015 to 2014 was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 6.2% partially offset by an increase in the average sales per transaction of 4.4%. To respond to the softness of sales in our apparel and footwear categories, we have taken a number of actions. We have tested national brand shops in a number of stores, and the results indicate no gross margin rate loss versus our base stores, greater productivity in sales per square foot, and higher penetration of casual apparel sales versus the base. We plan to increase the store count in this test in 2016. We also will be testing alternate labor strategies in our apparel areas to provide better sales coverage during peak selling times. Lastly, our plan for 2016 assumes a greater focus on everyday value in the better\u201d part of our assortment.\nAverage sales per square foot for stores that were open during the entire year were $344 for 2015 compared to $348 for 2014. Our new format stores continue to generate an increase in sales per square foot compared to our legacy stores. However, the stores we opened in 2015 did not meet our sales and profitability expectations and, as a result, we intend to slow new store growth over the next two years as we address retail store performance and productivity. Currently, we are analyzing our store model to assess store level performance and productivity including sales per square foot, store operating contribution margin, store cash flow, construction costs within a store, allocation of space within a store, brand assortment between national brands and Cabela's brand, and customer experience within a store. Our goal is to have a store model that is more predictable in order to maximize sales, margins, cash flows, and an acceptable return on invested capital. We plan to open eight new stores in 2016 with total retail square footage of approximately 600,000, which is over 7% annual square footage growth compared to the end of 2015.\nIn addition, our Cabela's branded products continue to be a core focus for us, as we saw growth of over 1% in Cabela's branded product categories in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2015, our Cabela's branded merchandise accounted for approximately 24% of total merchandise revenue compared to approximately 26% in 2014.\nWe recognize revenue as gift certificates and gift cards ( gift instruments\u201d) are redeemed for merchandise or services. We record gift instrument breakage as Retail revenue when the probability of redemption is remote. Gift instrument breakage recognized was $10 million and $9 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our gift instrument liability at the end of 2015 and 2014 was $184 million and $175 million, respectively.\nDirect Revenue - Direct revenue decreased $28 million, or 3.3%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The 53rd week in 2015 increased Direct revenue by $17 million; therefore, adjusted for 52 weeks, Direct revenue decreased $45 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in Direct revenue was due to decreases in each of our three major product categories comparing the respective years attributable to decreases in the\n \u2022 clothing and footwear product category of approximately 51%, \n \u2022 hunting equipment product category of approximately 37%, and \n \u2022 general outdoors product category of approximately 12%.  A significant factor in the decrease in our clothing and footwear product category was the negative impact that the unseasonably warm weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 had on sales of fall and winter apparel and footwear. The decrease in the hunting equipment product category was due mostly to a shift in ammunition sales from the Direct segment to the Retail segment.\nInternet sales increased slightly in 2015 (53 weeks) compared to 2014 (52 weeks). The number of visitors to our website increased 15% in 2015 compared to a decrease of 8% in 2014 as we saw a return to normalized traffic after the surge in sales of ammunition in 2013 and the subsequent decrease in 2014. We intend to expand our drop-ship sales program through our high traffic website, which will increase the exposure of national brands, provide low risk expansion of product lines, and provide faster distribution of products.\nFinancial Services Revenue - The following table sets forth the components of Financial Services revenue for the years ended: \nFinancial Services revenue increased $72 million, or 16.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in interest and fee income of $81 million was due to increases in credit card loans and the revolving rate. The increase in interchange income of $27 million was primarily due to increases in credit card purchases and the interchange rate. The increase in the provision for loan losses of $23 million was due to growth in the average outstanding balance of credit card loans and, to a lesser extent, increases in loan delinquencies.\nThe following table sets forth the components of Financial Services revenue as a percentage of average total credit card loans, including any accrued interest and fees, for the years ended:\n\nOur Cabela's CLUB Visa credit card loyalty program allows customers to earn points whenever and wherever they use their credit card, and then redeem earned points for products and services at our retail stores or through our Direct business. The percentage of our merchandise sold to customers using the Cabela's CLUB Visa credit card was 30% for both 2015 and 2014. The dollar amount related to points is accrued as earned by the cardholder and recorded as a reduction in Financial Services revenue. The dollar amount of unredeemed credit card points and loyalty points was $181 million at the end of 2015 compared to $165 million at the end of 2014.\nKey statistics reflecting the performance of Cabela's CLUB are shown in the following table for the years ended:\n\n (1) Includes accrued interest and fees.  The average balance of credit card loans increased to $4.5 billion, or 13.4%, for 2015 compared to 2014 due to increases in the number of active accounts and the average balance per account. We define an active credit card account as any account with an outstanding debit or credit balance at the end of any respective month. The average number of active accounts increased to 1.9 million, or 6.8%, compared to 2014 due to our successful marketing efforts in new account acquisitions. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased to 1.70% for 2015, up one basis point compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in loan delinquencies and a decrease in payment rates, partially offset by improvements in recovery rates. Recovery rates were positively impacted in 2015 due to a bulk sale of bankruptcy loans and acceleration of the timing of a sale of charged-off loans, which resulted in an 11 basis point reduction in the charge-off rate.\nSee Asset Quality of Cabela's CLUB\u201d in this report for additional information on trends in delinquencies and non-accrual loans and analysis of our allowance for loan losses.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue decreased $2 million in 2015 to $13 million compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales revenue in 2015 compared to 2014.\nMerchandise Gross Profit\nMerchandise gross profit is defined as merchandise sales, including shipping fees charged to customers, less the costs of related merchandise sold and shipping costs. Comparisons of merchandise gross profit and merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales for our operations, year over year, and to the retail industry in general, are impacted by:\n \u2022 retail store, distribution, and warehousing costs (including depreciation and amortization), which we exclude from our cost of revenue; \n \u2022 customer service related revenue we include in merchandise sales for which there are no costs of revenue; and \n \u2022 shipping costs we include in cost of revenue.  Comparisons and analysis of our merchandise gross profit on merchandise sales are presented below for the years ended:\n\nOur merchandise gross profit increased $53 million, or 4.7%, to $1.2 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to new retail store growth. Our merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales decreased 140 basis points to 34.3% in 2015 from 35.7% in 2014 due to our markdown and pricing strategy and, to a lesser extent, increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories. The impact of the decrease due to markdown and pricing strategy was disproportionately higher than the change due to increased sales of lower margin firearms, ammunition, and powersports products combined with lower sales in our higher margin soft goods and apparel categories.\nSelling, Distribution, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, distribution, and administrative expenses ( SD&A\u201d) include all operating expenses related to our retail stores, website, distribution centers, product procurement, Cabela's CLUB credit card operations, and overhead costs, including: advertising and marketing, catalog costs, employee compensation and benefits, occupancy costs, information systems processing, and depreciation and amortization.\nComparisons and analysis of our SD&A expenses are presented below for the years ended:\n\nSD&A expenses increased $136 million, or 10.9%, in 2015 (53 weeks) compared to 2014 (52 weeks). SD&A expenses increased primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas and a $14 million increase in incentive compensation in 2015. We did not incur any incentive compensation expense in 2014. In 2015, we incurred a $6 million charge for severance and related benefits (which was included in impairment and restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of income) due to a corporate office restructure and reduction in the number of personnel. In addition to this reduction in the number of corporate personnel, we continue to focus on expense management throughout the Company pursuant to a major multi-year corporate restructuring project aimed at lowering the Company's operating expense base. In 2015, we identified several expense reduction opportunities that we have implemented or are in the process of implementing that should benefit operating income in upcoming periods. The goal of this restructuring project is to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue by 75 to 150 basis points over the next three years.\nThe most significant factors contributing to the changes in SD&A expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 included:\n \u2022 an increase of $94 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas, which increase also includes a $14 million increase in incentive compensation in 2015; and \n \u2022 an increase of $32 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and to the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores as well as corporate offices. \nSignificant changes in our consolidated SD&A expenses related to specific business segments included:\nRetail Segment:\n \u2022 An increase of $43 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to the opening of new retail stores. \n \u2022 An increase of $27 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and to the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores. \nDirect Segment:\n \u2022 A decrease of $1 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor in part related to our emphasis on operating expense management. \nFinancial Services Segment:\n \u2022 An increase of $9 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor to support the growth of credit card operations. \nCorporate Overhead, Distribution Centers, and Other:\n \u2022 An increase of $43 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to costs in related support areas, which increase also includes a $14 million increase in incentive compensation in 2015. \n \u2022 An increase of $5 million in building costs primarily related to the operations and maintenance of our corporate office to support operational growth.  Impairment and Restructuring Charges\nImpairment and restructuring charges consisted of the following for the years ended:\n\nImpairment - Long-lived assets are evaluated for possible impairment (i) whenever changes in circumstances may indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and (ii) at least annually for recurring fair value measurements and for those assets not subject to amortization. In 2015 and 2014, we evaluated the recoverability of economic development bonds, property (including existing store locations and future retail store sites), equipment, goodwill, other property, and other intangible assets. We intend to sell our other property as soon as any such sale could be economically feasible, and we continue to monitor such property for impairment.\nIn 2015, we recognized an impairment loss of $4 million relating to the write-off of costs pertaining to store sites we had previously identified as future retail store locations but in 2015 decided not to develop based on the Company's plans to scale back retail store expansion for 2016 and 2017. This impairment was recorded in the Retail segment. Also in 2015, an impairment loss totaling $6 million was recognized on three separate parcels of land. The fair value on two parcels of land were based on appraisals and the fair value on the third parcel of land was based on discounted cash flow projection estimates (Level 3 inputs). This impairment loss was recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment. We did not recognize any impairment during 2014.\nLocal economic trends, government regulations, and other restrictions where we own properties may impact management projections that could change undiscounted cash flows in future periods and which could trigger possible future write downs.\nRestructuring Charges - In 2015, we incurred charges totaling $6 million for severance and related benefits due to a corporate office restructure and reduction in the number of personnel. The liability for severance benefits was included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and will be reduced as payments are disbursed, which will be substantially completed over the next 12 months. The charges were recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment.\nIn June 2014, we announced the transition to a third-party logistics provider for our distribution needs in Canada and the closing of our distribution center in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Accordingly, in 2014, we recognized a restructuring charge related to employee severance agreements and termination benefits totaling approximately $1 million. This restructuring charge was recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income is revenue less cost of revenue; selling, distribution, and administrative expenses; and impairment and restructuring charges. Operating income for our merchandise business segments excludes costs associated with operating expenses of distribution centers, procurement activities, and other corporate overhead costs.\nComparisons and analysis of operating income are presented below for the years ended:\n\nTotal operating income decreased $28 million, or 8.2%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and total operating income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 150 basis points to 7.7% for 2015. The decreases in total operating income and total operating income as a percentage of total revenue were primarily due to increases in consolidated operating expenses and impairment and restructuring charges and a decrease in revenue from our Direct segment. These decreases to operating income were partially offset by increases in revenue from our Retail and Financial Services segments and an increase in our merchandise gross profit. Operating expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas, and due to an increase in incentive compensation in 2015 as we did not incur any incentive compensation expense in 2014. We are focusing on expense management throughout the Company and have implemented many expense reduction efforts that should continue to benefit operating income in upcoming periods. We plan to continue our retail expansion, our omni-channel initiatives, and our Cabela's branded product investments as we focus on expense management controls consistent with our multi-year corporate restructuring project.\nUnder an Intercompany Agreement, the Financial Services segment pays to the Retail and Direct business segments a fixed license fee that includes 70 basis points on all originated charge volume of the Cabela's CLUB Visa credit card portfolio. In addition, among other items, the agreement requires the Financial Services segment to reimburse the Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs, which are recorded as a reduction to Financial Services segment revenue and as a reduction to merchandise costs associated with the Retail and Direct segments. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, this reimbursement from our Financial Services segment to our Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs has been adjusted to eliminate in consolidation. Periods prior to the second quarter of 2014 have not been adjusted.\nAlso, if the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB is greater than 13% at any quarter end, the Financial Services segment must pay an additional license fee to the Retail and Direct business segments equal to 50% of the amount that the total risk-based capital ratio exceeds 13%. At December 31, 2015, and the end of each calendar quarter in 2015, the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB did not exceed this 13% threshold, so no additional license fee was paid. At March 31, 2014, the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB exceeded 13%. Therefore, in accordance with our Intercompany Agreement, an additional license fee of $11 million was paid in April 2014 by the Financial Services segment to the Retail segment ($7 million) and Direct segment ($4 million) and was classified in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses. Comparing the changes in operating income as a percentage of segment revenue in 2015 to 2014, this additional license fee payment of $11 million to our segments accounted for:\n\u20220.3% of the 1.8% decrease for the Retail segment,\n\u20220.5% of the 3.1% decrease for the Direct segment, and\n\u20222.6% of the 9.0% increase for the Financial Services segment.\nTotal fees paid under the Intercompany Agreement by the Financial Services segment to these two segments, including the $11 million payment in 2014 triggered by the excess total risk-based capital ratio provision, increased $2 million in 2015 compared to 2014; a $13 million increase to the Retail segment and an $11 million decrease to the Direct segment.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, was $23 million and $22 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We incur interest expense on our revolving credit facilities, our long-term debt, and on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits. The amount of interest capitalized increased to $10 million in 2015 compared to $8 million in 2014 primarily due to our new corporate facility and the distribution center in Tooele, Utah. However, this increase in the amount of interest capitalized comparing the respective years was partially offset due to additional interest expense recognized in 2015 associated with our uncertain tax positions, the issuances of the new unsecured notes for $250 million in August 2015 and $300 million in December 2015, and higher outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOther Non-Operating Income, Net\nOther non-operating income was $10 million in 2015 compared to $5 million in 2014. This income is primarily from interest earned on our economic development bonds.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 35.7% in 2015 compared to 36.7% in 2014. The decrease in our effective tax rate comparing the respective years was primarily due to a decrease in our effective tax rate related to tax adjustments attributable to changes in the mix of taxable income between the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions and completion of a retroactive research and development tax credit study during 2015. These decreases in our effective tax rate were partially offset by increases in unrecognized tax benefits and a deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to Canada taxable net operating losses.\nThe balance of unrecognized tax benefits totaled $73 million at January 2, 2016, and was classified in long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, compared to a total of $102 million at December 27, 2014, with $46 million classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities and $56 million in long-term liabilities.\nResults of Operations - 2014 Compared to 2013\nRevenues\nComparisons and analysis of our revenues are presented below for the years ended: \nProduct Sales Mix - The following table sets forth the percentage of our merchandise revenue contributed by major product categories for our Retail and Direct segments and in total for the years ended:\n\nRetail Revenue - Retail revenue increased $117 million, or 5.3%, in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase of $376 million in revenue from the addition of new retail stores. The increase in retail revenue from new retail stores was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of $255 million.\nComparable store sales and analysis are presented below for the years ended:\n\nThe decrease in comparable store sales comparing 2014 to 2013 was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions of 12.2% and in average sales per transaction of 0.1%. In addition, the $255 million decrease in comparable store sales was across all major product categories comparing 2014 to 2013, and was attributable to decreases in the\n \u2022 hunting equipment product category of approximately 76%, \n \u2022 general outdoors product category of approximately 11%, and \n \u2022 clothing and footwear product category of approximately 13%. \nAs noted in the preceding paragraph, most of the decrease in comparable store sales was due to a decrease in the hunting equipment product category, with 87% of such decrease primarily due to a decrease in sales of firearms and ammunition, as consumer demand for firearms and ammunition was significantly greater in 2013 compared to 2014. We believed that the decreases in sales of firearms and ammunition had begun to level out in 2014, and we expected sales of firearms and ammunition to return to more normalized levels in fiscal 2015. Gift instrument breakage recognized was $9 million and $7 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Average sales per square foot for stores that were open during the entire year were $348 for 2014 compared to $385 for 2013 due to the reasons discussed above. However, our new format retail stores continued to perform better on a sales per square foot basis than our legacy stores.\nDirect Revenue - Direct revenue decreased $122 million, or 12.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013. This $122 million decrease in Direct revenue was across all major product categories and was attributable to decreases in the\n \u2022 hunting equipment product category of approximately 72%, \n \u2022 general outdoors product category of approximately 8%, and \n \u2022 clothing and footwear product category of approximately 20%. \nAs noted above, most of the decrease in Direct revenue was due to a decrease in the hunting equipment product category with 82% of such decrease primarily due to a decrease in sales of ammunition and other shooting related products compared to 2013. Although we are not able to specifically quantify the impact, we believe that our Direct revenue also decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 from expected cannibalization due to our customers shopping at new Cabela's retail store locations.\nInternet sales decreased in 2014 compared to 2013. The number of visitors to our website decreased 8% in 2014 after experiencing record growth of nearly 26% in 2013 due to the surge in sales of ammunition. Our website traffic was also negatively effected by the expected cannibalization from our new retail store growth. Our hunting equipment and general outdoors categories were the largest dollar volume contributors to our Direct revenue for 2014. The number of active Direct customers, which we define as those customers who have purchased merchandise from us in the last twelve months, remained relatively even compared to 2013.\nWe continued to focus on smaller, more specialized catalogs, and we reduced the number of pages mailed and decreased total circulation, leading to continued reductions in catalog related costs. Increases in website and mobile platform related expenses due to our expanded use of digital marketing channels and enhancements to our website mostly offset the reductions in catalog related costs.\nFinancial Services Revenue - The following table sets forth the components of our Financial Services revenue for the years ended:\n\nFinancial Services revenue increased $55 million, or 14.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in interest and fee income of $58 million was due to increases in credit card loans and the mix of credit card loans carrying interest, partially offset by lower rates in LIBOR. The provision for loan losses increased $19 million primarily due to growth in the average outstanding balance of credit card loans in 2014 compared to 2013. In addition, the provision for loan losses in 2013 was lower, in part, due to declining balances in our restructured loan portfolio, improvements in historical charge-off trends, and other performance data in this portfolio. The increase in interchange income of $22 million was primarily due to an increase in credit card purchases, partially offset by a decrease in the interchange rate. The decrease in other non-interest income was a result of the discontinuance of an identity theft program in 2013. The increase in credit card purchases also increased customer rewards costs, with such increase in 2014 compared to 2013 offset by the adjustment in the presentation of reimbursements between segments for certain promotional costs totaling $15 million for 2014. The impact of this reimbursement adjustment resulted in an increase in Financial Services revenue and an increase in merchandise cost of sales by the same amount. This presentation will be ongoing and had no impact on consolidated operating income or earnings per diluted share.\nThe following table sets forth the components of our Financial Services revenue as a percentage of average total credit card loans, including any accrued interest and fees, for the years ended:\n\nThe percentage of our merchandise sold to customers using the Cabela's CLUB Visa credit card approximated 30% for both 2014 and 2013. The dollar amounts related to points are accrued as earned by the cardholder and recorded as a reduction in Financial Services revenue. The dollar amount of unredeemed credit card points and loyalty points was $165 million at the end of 2014 compared to $146 million at the end of 2013.\nKey statistics reflecting the performance of Cabela's CLUB are shown in the following table for the years ended:\n\n (1) Includes accrued interest and fees.  The average balance of credit card loans increased to $3.9 billion, or 12.5%, for 2014 compared to 2013 due to increases in the number of active accounts and the average balance per account. We define an active credit card account as any account with an outstanding debit or credit balance at the end of any respective month during the past 12 months. The average number of active accounts increased to 1.8 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2013 due to our successful marketing efforts in new account acquisitions. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans decreased to 1.69% for 2014, down 11 basis points compared to 2013, due to improvements in the quality of our credit card portfolio evidenced by continued low delinquencies, an increase in recovery rates, and declining loan balances in our restructured loan portfolio.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue decreased $2 million in 2014 to $15 million compared to 2013 primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales revenue in 2014 compared to 2013.\nMerchandise Gross Profit\nComparisons and analysis of our gross profit on merchandising revenue are presented below for the years ended:\n\nOur merchandise gross profit decreased $37 million, or 3.1%, to $1.1 billion in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a decrease in sales of firearms and ammunition in 2014 compared to 2013.\nOur merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales decreased 110 basis points to 35.7% in 2014 from 36.8% in 2013. The decrease in the merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased sales discounts and markdowns, which had an impact of approximately 70 basis points, and to an adjustment in the presentation of reimbursement between segments for certain promotional costs totaling $15 million for 2014, which had an impact of approximately 50 basis points. The effect of this reimbursement adjustment resulted in an increase in Financial Services revenue and an increase in merchandise cost of sales by the same amount. This presentation will be ongoing and had no impact on consolidated operating income or earnings per diluted share.\nSelling, Distribution, and Administrative Expenses\nComparisons and analysis of our selling, distribution, and administrative expenses were as follows for the years ended: \nSelling, distribution, and administrative expenses increased $50 million, or 4.1%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses increased primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas. We focused on expense management throughout the Company and implemented many expense reduction efforts that have shown benefits in 2014 and should continue to benefit operating income in upcoming periods. The most significant factors contributing to the changes in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 included:\n \u2022 an increase of $38 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and to the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores as well as corporate offices; \n \u2022 a decrease of $22 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation and our emphasis on operating expense management; \n \u2022 an increase of $20 million in advertising and promotional costs as we initiated our promotional activity earlier in the fourth quarter of 2014 in an effort to increase sales and to address pricing of competitors; and \n \u2022 an increase of $9 million in bad debt expense due to fraudulent transactions on the Cabela's CLUB credit card. \nSignificant changes in our selling, distribution, and administrative expenses related to specific business segments included the following:\nRetail Segment:\n \u2022 An increase of $26 million in building costs and depreciation primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and to the operations and maintenance of our existing retail stores. \n \u2022 An increase of $24 million in advertising and promotional costs. \n \u2022 An increase of $14 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to the opening of new retail stores.  Direct Segment:\n \u2022 A decrease of $20 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor in part related to our emphasis on operating expense management. \n \u2022 An increase of $20 million in advertising and promotional costs. \n \u2022 A decrease of $2 million in building costs and depreciation. \nFinancial Services Segment:\n \u2022 An increase of $9 million in bad debt expense due to fraudulent transactions on the Cabela's CLUB credit card. \n \u2022 An increase of $3 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor to support the growth of credit card operations. \n \u2022 A decrease of $1 million in advertising and promotional costs. \nCorporate Overhead, Distribution Centers, and Other:\n \u2022 A decrease of $19 million in employee compensation, benefits, and contract labor primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation and our emphasis on operating expense management. \n \u2022 An increase of $14 million in building costs primarily related to the operations and maintenance of our corporate office to support operational growth. \n \u2022 A decrease of $23 million in advertising and promotional costs primarily due to cost allocations between segments. \nImpairment and Restructuring Charges\nImpairment and restructuring charges consisted of the following for the years ended:\n\nIn 2014 and 2013, we evaluated the recoverability of economic development bonds, property (including existing store locations and future retail store sites), equipment, goodwill, other property, and other intangible assets.\nOn June 11, 2014, we announced the transition to a third-party logistics provider for our distribution needs in Canada and the closing of our distribution center in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in March 2015. The third-party logistics provider began processing a portion of our Canada merchandise in a Calgary, Alberta, distribution center in October 2014. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2014 the Company recognized a restructuring charge related to employee severance agreements and termination benefits totaling approximately $1 million. This restructuring charge was recognized in the Corporate Overhead and Other segment. We expected to incur approximately $2 million in additional incremental expenses related to the transition to this third-party logistics provider and the closing of our current distribution center in the first half of fiscal 2015.\nOn February 4, 2014, a United States district court (the Court\u201d) entered a judgment against the Company in the amount of $14 million relating to litigation regarding a breach of a retail store radius restriction. At December 28, 2013, pursuant to this judgment, we recognized a liability of $14 million, including an estimated amount for legal fees and costs, in our consolidated balance sheet. The recognition of this liability at December 28, 2013, resulted in the Company recording an increase to the carrying amount of the related retail store property through a reduction in deferred grant income by the amount repayable, plus legal and other costs. The cumulative additional depreciation that would have been recognized through December 28, 2013, as an expense in the absence of these grants was recognized in 2013 as depreciation expense. Therefore, the adjustment that reduced the deferred grant income of this retail store property at December 28, 2013, resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of $5 million in 2013, which was included in impairment and restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of income. This impairment loss was recognized in the Retail segment.\nOn March 21, 2014, through a supplemental judgment, the Court ordered that we pay interest in the amount of $1 million to the defendant. Therefore, our liability relating to this judgment increased in the first quarter of 2014 resulting in the Company recording an increase to the carrying amount of the related retail store property through a reduction in deferred grant income. The additional depreciation adjustment that reduced the deferred grant income of this retail store property resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $1 million that was recognized in the three months ended March 29, 2014. This increase in depreciation expense was included in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and was recognized in the Retail segment. There was no additional depreciation expense adjustment recognized after March 29, 2014. At December 27, 2014, this liability totaled $16 million.\nWe recognized an impairment loss totaling $1 million in 2013 related to the store closure of our former Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, retail site. The impairment loss of $1 million included leasehold improvement write-offs as well as lease cancellation and restoration costs. This impairment loss was recognized in the Retail and the Corporate Overhead and Other segments.\nOperating Income\nComparisons and analysis of operating income are presented below for the years ended:\n\nOperating income decreased $26 million, or 7.2%, in 2014 compared to 2013, and operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased 80 basis points to 9.2% for 2014. The decreases in total operating income and total operating income as a percentage of total revenue were primarily due to an increase in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses, a decrease in revenue from our Direct business segment, and a decrease in our merchandise gross profit. These decreases to operating income were partially offset by increased operating income contributions from our Financial Services segment. Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to additional costs from increases in the number of new stores and costs in related support areas.\nUnder an Intercompany Agreement, the Financial Services segment pays to the Retail and Direct business segments a fixed license fee that includes 70 basis points on all originated charge volume of the Cabela's CLUB Visa credit card portfolio. In addition, among other items, the agreement requires the Financial Services segment to reimburse the Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs, which are recorded as a reduction to Financial Services segment revenue and as a reduction to merchandise costs associated with the Retail and Direct segments. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, this reimbursement from our Financial Services segment to our Retail and Direct segments for certain promotional costs has been adjusted to eliminate in consolidation. Prior periods have not been adjusted. Also, if the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB is greater than 13% at any quarter end, the Financial Services segment must pay an additional license fee to the Retail and Direct business segments equal to 50% of the amount that the total risk-based capital ratio exceeds 13%. At March 31, 2014, the total risk-based capital ratio of WFB exceeded this 13% threshold; therefore, an additional license fee of $11 million was paid in April 2014 by the Financial Services segment to the Retail segment ($7 million) and the Direct segment ($4 million). Total fees paid under the Intercompany Agreement by the Financial Services segment to these two segments, including the $11 million payment triggered by the excess total risk-based capital ratio provision, increased $20 million in 2014 compared to 2013; a $24 million increase to the Retail segment and a $4 million decrease to the Direct segment.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income, was $22 million in both 2014 and 2013. The amount of interest capitalized increased to $8 million in 2014 compared to $4 million in 2013 primarily due to more stores opened. However, the increase in the amount of interest capitalized comparing the respective years was offset by additional interest expense recognized in 2014 associated with our uncertain tax positions and increases in interest expense due to higher outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility.\nOther Non-Operating Income, Net\nOther non-operating income was $5 million in 2014 compared to $4 million in 2013. This income is primarily from interest earned on our economic development bonds.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 36.7% in 2014 compared to 34.7% in 2013. The increase in our effective tax rate comparing the respective fiscal years is due to an increase of $4 million in accrued income tax related to tax adjustments attributable to changes in the mix of prior year taxable income between the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions and an increase in our state effective tax rate.\nAsset Quality of Cabela's CLUB\nDelinquencies and Non-Accrual\nWe consider the entire balance of an account, including any accrued interest and fees, delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date. Our aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which a customer has failed to make a required payment. As part of collection efforts, a credit card loan may be closed and placed on non-accrual or restructured in a fixed payment plan prior to charge-off. Our fixed payment plans require payment of the loan within 60 months and consist of a lower interest rate, reduced minimum payment, and elimination of fees. Loans on fixed payment plans include loans in which the customer has engaged a consumer credit counseling agency to assist them in managing their debt. Customers who miss two consecutive payments once placed on a payment plan or non-accrual will resume accruing interest at the rate they had accrued at before they were placed on a plan. Interest and fees are accrued in accordance with the terms of the applicable cardholder agreements or payment plan on credit card loans until the date of charge-off unless placed on non-accrual. Payments received on non-accrual loans are applied to principal and reduce the amount of the loan.\nThe quality of our credit card loan portfolio at any time reflects, among other factors: 1) the creditworthiness of cardholders, 2) general economic conditions, 3) the success of our account management and collection activities, and 4) the life-cycle stage of the portfolio. During periods of economic weakness, delinquencies and net charge-offs are more likely to increase. We have mitigated periods of economic weakness by selecting a customer base that is very creditworthy. We use the scores of Fair Isaac Corporation ( FICO\u201d), a widely-used financial metric for assessing an individual's credit rating, as the primary credit quality indicator. The median FICO score of our credit cardholders was 794 at the end of 2015 and 795 at the end of 2014.\nThe following table reports delinquencies, including any delinquent non-accrual and restructured credit card loans, as a percentage of our credit card loans, including any accrued interest and fees, in a manner consistent with our monthly external reporting for the years ended:\n\nDelinquencies increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due, in part, to generally challenging consumer conditions affecting payment rates as well as certain changes we made in our collection efforts on delinquent accounts. While our delinquency levels have increased compared to prior years, we believe our delinquency levels remained below industry averages at the end of 2015.\nThe table below shows delinquent, non-accrual, and restructured loans as a percentage of our credit card loans, including any accrued interest and fees, at the years ended:\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Charge-offs\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio. For information on the accounting policy, estimates, and assumptions relating to our allowance for loan losses on our credit card loan portfolio, please refer to Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d under the section titled Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nCharge-offs consist of the uncollectible principal, interest, and fees on a customer's account. Recoveries are the amounts collected on previously charged-off accounts, including such accounts that are sold to a third party. Most bankcard issuers charge off accounts at 180 days. We charge off credit card loans on a daily basis after an account becomes at a minimum 130 days contractually delinquent to allow us to manage the collection process more efficiently. Accounts relating to cardholder bankruptcies, cardholder deaths, and fraudulent transactions are charged off earlier.\nThe following table shows the activity in our allowance for loan losses and charge-off activity for the years ended:\n\nNet charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card loans increased to 1.70% for 2015, up one basis point compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in loan delinquencies and a decrease in payment rates, partially offset by improvements in recovery rates. Recovery rates were positively impacted in 2015 due to a bulk sale of bankruptcy loans and acceleration of the timing of a sale of charged-off loans, which resulted in an 11 basis point reduction in the charge-off rate.\nAging of Credit Cards Loans Outstanding\nThe following table shows our credit card loans outstanding at the end of 2015 and 2014 segregated by the number of months passed since the accounts were opened.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur Retail and Direct segments and our Financial Services segment have significantly differing liquidity and capital needs. We believe that we will have sufficient capital available from cash on hand, our revolving credit facility, and other borrowing sources to fund our cash requirements and near-term growth plans for at least the next 12 months. At the end of 2015 and 2014, cash on a consolidated basis totaled $315 million and $143 million, of which $157 million and $49 million, respectively, was cash at the Financial Services segment which is utilized to meet this segment's liquidity requirements. We evaluate the credit markets for securitizations and certificates of deposit to determine the most cost effective source of funds for the Financial Services segment. During 2015, the Financial Services segment issued certificates of deposit, completed term securitizations, and increased its variable funding facility. In 2016, the Financial Services segment intends to issue additional certificates of deposit and term securitizations. We believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund the Financial Services segment's foreseeable cash requirements, including maturities, and near-term growth plans.\nAs of January 2, 2016, cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $97 million. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the United States for capital expansion. The Company has not provided United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that the Company considers to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States as of the end of year 2015. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related United States tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of the year ended 2015, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $191 million. If those earnings were not considered indefinitely invested, the Company estimates that an additional income tax expense of approximately $44 million would be recorded. Based on our current projected capital needs and the current amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, we do not anticipate incurring any material tax costs beyond our accrued tax position in connection with any repatriation, but we may be required to accrue for unanticipated additional tax costs in the future if our expectations or the amount of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries change.\nRetail and Direct Segments - The primary cash requirements of our merchandising business relate to capital for new retail stores, purchases of inventory, investments in our management information systems and infrastructure, and general working capital needs. We historically have met these requirements with cash generated from our merchandising business operations, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, and by issuing debt and equity securities.\nThe cash flow we generate from our merchandising business is seasonal, with our peak cash requirements for inventory occurring from April through November. While we have consistently generated overall positive annual cash flow from our operating activities, other sources of liquidity are required by our merchandising business during these peak cash use periods. These sources historically have included short-term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to debt markets. While we generally have been able to manage our cash needs during peak periods, if any disruption occurred to our funding sources, or if we underestimated our cash needs, we would be unable to purchase inventory and otherwise conduct our merchandising business to its maximum effectiveness, which could result in reduced revenue and profits.\nOur credit agreement provides for an unsecured $775 million revolving credit facility and permits the issuance of letters of credit up to $75 million and swing line loans up to $30 million. The credit facility may be increased to $800 million subject to certain terms and conditions. The term of the credit facility expires on June 18, 2019. Advances under the credit facility will be used for the Company's general business purposes, including working capital support.\nOur unsecured $775 million revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes contain certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of minimum debt coverage, a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio, and a minimum consolidated net worth standard. In the event that we failed to comply with these covenants, a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable. At January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes. We anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes through at least the next 12 months.\nOn August 4, 2015, we entered into a note purchase agreement with various purchasers allowing us to issue and sell an aggregate of $550 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement to certain accredited investors. On August 4, 2015, we issued and sold under this note purchase agreement $250 million of senior unsecured notes with $100 million principal at 3.23% due August 4, 2020, $122 million principal at 3.70% due August 4, 2022, and $28 million principal at 4.01% due August 4, 2025. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually. On December 2, 2015, we issued and sold an additional $300 million of senior unsecured notes with $128 million principal at 3.82% due December 3, 2022, and $172 million principal at 4.11% due December 3, 2025. We have used the proceeds from this sale for general corporate purposes and intend to repay our existing unsecured notes for $215 million due February 27, 2016.\nWe have an unsecured $20 million Canadian (\"CAD\") revolving credit facility for our operations in Canada. Borrowings are payable on demand with interest payable monthly. The credit facility permits the issuance of letters of credit up to $10 million CAD in the aggregate, which reduce the overall credit limit available under the credit facility.\nIn April 2015, we announced our intent to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in open market transactions through February 2016. We completed the repurchase of our common stock under this authorization in August 2015 at a total cost of $100 million.\nOn September 1, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock over a two-year period. This authorization is in addition to the 2,000,000 share repurchase authorization approved in April 2015 and the standing annual authorization to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from equity-based awards issued under the Company's equity compensation plans. The timing and volume of share repurchases may be executed by the Company on a discretionary basis, or pursuant to trading plans, or other arrangements. Any share repurchase under this program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. This share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any outstanding shares of our common stock, and the program may be limited or terminated at any time. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that we will repurchase. The total amount of share repurchases that the Company can make in a year is limited to 75% of its prior year consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined, pursuant to a covenant requirement of its credit agreement. Under this authorization, we repurchased 1,989,305 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $74 million in 2015.\nFinancial Services Segment - The primary cash requirements of the Financial Services segment relate to the financing of credit card loans. These cash requirements will increase if our credit card originations increase or if our cardholders' balances or spending increase. The Financial Services segment sources operating funds in the ordinary course of business through various financing activities, which include funding obtained from securitization transactions, obtaining brokered and non-brokered certificates of deposit, borrowings under its federal funds purchase agreements, and cash generated from operations. During 2015, the Financial Services segment issued $352 million in certificates of deposit, completed two term securitizations totaling $775 million, and increased its $225 million variable funding facility originally scheduled to mature in March 2015 to $300 million and extended its maturity date to March 2018. We believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund the Financial Services segment's foreseeable cash requirements, including maturities, and near-term growth plans. The Trust has two $300 million term securitizations with expected principal payment due dates in June 2016 and October 2016. The principal payments are expected to be funded from restricted cash generated from credit card operations of the Trust.\nWFB is prohibited by regulations from lending money to Cabela's or other affiliates. WFB is subject to capital requirements imposed by Nebraska banking law and the Visa U.S.A., Inc. membership rules, and its ability to pay dividends is also limited by Nebraska and Federal banking law. If there are any disruptions in the credit markets, the Financial Services segment, like many other financial institutions, may increase its funding from certificates of deposit which may result in increased competition in the deposits market with fewer funds available or at unattractive rates. Our ability to issue certificates of deposit is reliant on our current regulatory capital levels. WFB is classified as a well-capitalized\u201d bank, the highest category under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. If WFB were to be classified as an adequately-capitalized\u201d bank, which is the next level category down from well-capitalized,\u201d we would be required to obtain a waiver from the FDIC in order to continue to issue certificates of deposit. We will invest additional capital in the Financial Services segment, if necessary, in order for WFB to continue to meet the minimum requirements for the well-capitalized\u201d classification under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. In addition to the non-brokered certificates of deposit market to fund growth and maturing securitizations, we have access to the brokered certificates of deposit market through multiple financial institutions for liquidity and funding purposes.\nEffective January 2015, WFB was subject to the interim final rules and the joint final rules adopted by the FDIC in July 2013 pertaining to the implementation of regulatory capital reforms recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010, and capital reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These rules revised the agencies' prompt corrective action framework by introducing a common equity tier 1 capital\u201d requirement and a higher minimum tier 1 capital\u201d requirement. The impact of the adoption of these rules was minimal to WFB.\nFor a discussion of other additional legislative and regulatory developments that pertain to the Financial Services segment, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Current Business Environment - Developments in Legislation and Regulation.\u201d\nOperating, Investing and Financing Activities\nThe following table presents changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended:\n\n2015 versus 2014\nOperating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities was $327 million in 2015, a net increase of $69 million compared to 2014. Comparing the respective years, we had a net increase of $84 million related to income taxes, as we paid a deposit of $50 million in 2014 for federal taxes related to prior period uncertain tax positions, a net increase of $50 million in inventories, and an increase of $23 million in provision for loan losses. The increase in inventories in 2015 was primarily due to the addition of new retail stores as inventory levels totaled $819 million at the end of 2015 compared to $760 million at the end of 2014.\nMostly offsetting these increases were net decreases of $32 million relating to accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to increases in inventories and in the number of retail stores; $25 million in other long-term liabilities due to changes related to prior period uncertain positions; $22 million in gift instruments, credit card rewards, and loyalty rewards programs due to increased volume; and $22 million in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nInvesting Activities - Cash used in investing activities decreased $488 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the use of $605 million in restricted cash of the Trust. Restricted cash of the Trust was used to repay $468 million of Series 2010-I and Series 2010-II notes in 2015 and totaled $41 million at January 2, 2016, compared to $335 million at December 27, 2014. Cash paid for property and equipment totaled $413 million in 2015 compared to $441 million in 2014. At January 2, 2016, the Company estimated it had total cash commitments of approximately $182 million outstanding for projected expenditures related to the development, construction, and completion of new retail stores. We expect to fund these estimated capital expenditures over the next 12 months with funds from operations and borrowings. In addition, we had a net decrease in cash of $142 million related to our credit card loan activity from outside sources.\nThe following table presents activity related to our retail stores for the years ended:\n\nFinancing Activities - Cash provided by financing activities decreased $322 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This net change in cash was primarily due to an decrease in net borrowings on secured obligations of the Trust by the Financial Services segment of $659 million. Our Series 2010-I and Series 2010-II notes totaling $468 million were repaid in 2015 using restricted cash of the Trust, secured variable funding obligations totaling $480 million of the Trust were repaid, and $45 million in variable funding facilities was borrowed in 2014. We also had net decreases comparing the respective periods of $292 million in net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and $31 million in unpresented checks. Lastly, in 2015, we repurchased shares of our common stock at a cost of $174 million.\nThese decreases were partially offset by our issuance in 2015 of $550 million of senior unsecured notes and an increase of $337 million in time deposits compared to 2014, which the Financial Services segment utilizes as a source in funding its credit card operations. The Trust also issues variable funding facilities which are considered secured obligations backed by restricted credit card loans. At January 2, 2016, the Trust had three variable funding facilities with $1.1 billion in total capacity and $655 million outstanding.\nThe following table presents the borrowing activities of our merchandising business and the Financial Services segment for the years ended:\n\nThe following table summarizes our availability under the Company's debt and credit facilities, excluding the facilities of the Financial Services segment, at the years ended:\n\n (1) Consists of our revolving credit facility of $775 million and our $20 million CAD credit facility (which for both years has not been translated into United States dollars). \nThe Financial Services segment also has total borrowing availability of $100 million under its agreements to borrow federal funds. At January 2, 2016, the entire $100 million of borrowing capacity was available.\nOur $775 million unsecured credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and other customary covenants, including:\n \u2022 a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined) of no less than 2.00 to 1 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters (as defined); \n \u2022 a leverage ratio (as defined) of no more than 3.00 to 1 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; and \n \u2022 a minimum consolidated net worth standard (as defined) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. \nIn addition, our unsecured senior notes contain various covenants and restrictions that are usual and customary for transactions of this type. Also, the debt agreements contain cross default provisions to other outstanding credit facilities. In the event that we failed to comply with these covenants, a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable. At January 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes. We anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes through the next 12 months.\n2014 versus 2013\nOperating Activities - Net cash provided from operating activities was $258 million in 2014 compared to $345 million in 2013. We paid a deposit of $50 million in 2014 for federal taxes related to prior period uncertain tax positions, which was the primary reason for the decrease of $71 million in the income tax accounts comparing the respective years. In addition, we had net decreases of $45 million in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to a timing difference in our Visa interchange funding for the Financial Services segment, $27 million in inventories, and $23 million in accounts receivable. Partially offsetting these decreases in cash from operating activities were increases of $80 million relating to accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to increases in inventories and in the number of retail stores, $20 million in gift instruments, credit card rewards, and loyalty rewards programs due to increased volume, and $20 million in depreciation and amortization. We increased inventory levels by $115 million at December 27, 2014, to $760 million, compared to 2013, where our inventory levels increased $92 million compared to year end 2012. The increase in inventories in 2014 was primarily due to the addition of new retail stores.\nInvesting Activities - Cash used in investing activities increased $473 million in 2014 to $1.3 billion compared to 2013. Cash paid for property and equipment additions totaled $441 million in 2014 compared to $333 million in 2013. We estimated we had total cash commitments at December 27, 2014, of approximately $524 million to be funded through the next 12 months for projected expenditures related to the development, construction, and completion of new retail stores, a new distribution center, and expansion of our corporate offices. In addition, we had decreases of $306 million related to the change in restricted cash of the Trust and $60 million related to our credit card loans originated from outside sources. Our restricted cash of the Trust totaled $335 million at December 27, 2014, as we repaid $255 million of Series 2010-I notes in full on January 15, 2015.\nFinancing Activities - Cash provided by financing activities increased $598 million in 2014 to $957 million compared to 2013. This net change was primarily due to an increase in net borrowings on secured obligations of the Trust by the Financial Services segment of $675 million. We also had increases of $185 million in net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and inventory financing. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $285 million relating to changes in time deposits.\nEconomic Development Bonds and Grants\nIn the past, we have negotiated economic development arrangements with many local and state governments relating to the construction of a number of our new retail stores, including free land, monetary grants, and the recapture of incremental sales, property, or other taxes through economic development bonds. Where appropriate, we intend to continue to utilize economic development arrangements with state and local governments to offset some of the construction costs and improve the return on investment of our new retail stores.\nEconomic Development Bonds - Economic development bonds are related to our government economic assistance arrangements relating to the construction of new retail stores or retail development. The payments of principal and interest on the bonds are typically tied to sales, property, or lodging taxes generated from the store and, in some cases, from businesses in the surrounding area, over periods which range between 15 and 30 years. Some of our bonds may be repurchased for par value by the governmental entity prior to the maturity date of the bonds. The governmental entity from which we purchase the bonds is not otherwise liable for repayment of principal and interest on the bonds to the extent that the associated taxes are insufficient to pay the bonds. If sufficient tax revenue is not generated by the subject properties, we will not receive scheduled payments and will be unable to realize the full value of the bonds carried on our consolidated balance sheet. There were no other than temporary fair value adjustments of economic development bonds and no adjustments of deferred grant income related to economic development bonds in 2015 or 2014. However, at the end of 2015, we identified economic development bonds totaling $20 million where the actual tax revenues associated with these properties were lower than previously projected. We will continue to closely monitor the amounts and timing of projected cash flows from the properties related to these economic development bonds. At January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014, economic development bonds totaled $84 million and $82 million, respectively.\nOn a quarterly basis, we perform various procedures to analyze the amounts and timing of projected cash flows to be received from our economic development bonds. Please refer to Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the section entitled Economic Development Bonds\u201d for information on our procedures used to analyze the amounts and timing of projected cash flows to be received from our economic development bonds.\nGrants - Historically, we have received grant funding in exchange for commitments made by us to the state or local government providing the funding. The commitments, such as assurance of agreed employment and wage levels at our retail stores or that the retail store will remain open, typically phase out over approximately five to ten years. If we fail to maintain the commitments during the applicable period, the funds we received may have to be repaid or other adverse consequences may arise, which could affect our cash flows and profitability. The total amount of grant funding subject to a specific contractual remedy was $43 million at both January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014. At January 2, 2016, we had recorded $17 million in the consolidated balance sheets relating to these grants with $16 million in current liabilities and $1 million in long-term liabilities. At December 27, 2014, we had recorded $23 million in current liabilities.\nSecuritization of Credit Card Loans\nThe Financial Services segment historically has funded most of its growth in credit card loans through an asset securitization program. The Financial Services segment utilizes the Trust for the purpose of routinely securitizing credit card loans and issuing beneficial interest to investors. The Trust issues variable funding facilities and long-term notes (collectively referred to herein as secured obligations of the Trust\u201d), each of which has an undivided interest in the assets of the Trust. The Financial Services segment must retain a minimum 20 day average of 5% of the loans in the securitization trust which ranks pari passu with the investors' interests in the Trust. In addition, the Financial Services segment owns notes issued by the Trust from some of the securitizations, which in some cases may be subordinated to other notes issued. The Financial Services segment's retained interests are eliminated upon consolidation of the Trust. The consolidated assets of the Trust are subject to credit, payment, and interest rate risks on the transferred credit card loans. The credit card loans of the Trust are restricted for the repayment of the secured obligations of the Trust.\nTo protect the holders of the secured obligations of the Trust (the investors\u201d), the securitization structures include certain features that could result in earlier-than-expected repayment of the securities, which could cause the Financial Services segment to sustain a loss of one or more of its retained interests and could prompt the need to seek alternative sources of funding. The primary investor protection feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of loans to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. The Financial Services segment refers to this as the early amortization feature. Investors are allocated cash flows derived from activities related to the accounts comprising the securitized pool of loans, the amounts of which reflect finance charges collected, certain fee assessments collected, allocations of interchange, and recoveries on charged off accounts. These cash flows are considered to be restricted under the governing documents to pay interest to investors, servicing fees, and to absorb the investor's share of charge-offs occurring within the securitized pool of loans. Any cash flows remaining in excess of these requirements are reported to investors as excess spread. An excess spread of less than zero percent for a contractually specified period, generally a three-month average, would trigger an early amortization event. Such an event could result in the Financial Services segment incurring losses related to its retained interests. In addition, if the retained interest in the loans of the Financial Services segment falls below the 5% minimum 20 day average and the Financial Services segment fails to add new accounts to the securitized pool of loans, an early amortization event would be triggered.\nAnother feature, which is applicable to the secured obligations of the Trust, is one in which excess cash flows generated by the transferred loans are held at the Trust for the benefit of the investors. This cash reserve account funding is triggered when the three-month average excess spread rate of the Trust decreases to below 4.50% with increasing funding requirements as excess spread levels decline below preset levels or as contractually required by the governing documents. Similar to early amortization, this feature also is designed to protect the investors' interests from loss, thus making the cash restricted. Upon scheduled maturity or early amortization of a securitization, the Financial Services segment is required to remit principal payments received on the securitized pool of loans to the Trust which are restricted for the repayment of the investors' principal note. The investors have no recourse to the Financial Services segment's other assets for failure of debtors to pay other than for breaches of certain customary representations, warranties, and covenants. These representations, warranties, covenants, and the related indemnities do not protect the Trust or third party investors against credit-related losses on the loans.\nThe total amounts and maturities for our credit card securitizations as of January 2, 2016, were as follows:\n\nWe have been, and will continue to be, particularly reliant on funding from securitization transactions for the Financial Services segment. A failure to renew existing facilities or to add additional capacity on favorable terms as it becomes necessary could increase our financing costs and potentially limit our ability to grow the business of the Financial Services segment. Unfavorable conditions in the asset-backed securities markets generally, including the unavailability of commercial bank liquidity support or credit enhancements, could have a similar effect. In 2015, the Financial Services segment completed two term securitizations totaling $775 million and increased its $225 million variable funding facility originally scheduled to mature in March 2015 to $300 million and extended its maturity date to March 2018. In 2016, the Financial Services segment intends to issue additional certificates of deposit and term securitizations. We believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund the Financial Services segment's foreseeable cash requirements, including maturities, and near-term growth plans.\nFurthermore, the securitized credit card loans of the Financial Services segment could experience poor performance, including increased delinquencies and credit losses, lower payment rates, or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds. This could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in the Financial Services segment's securitization transactions, cause early amortization of these securities, or result in higher required credit enhancement levels. Credit card loans performed within established guidelines and no events which could trigger an early amortization occurred during the years ended January 2, 2016, and December 27, 2014.\nCertificates of Deposit\nThe Financial Services segment utilizes brokered and non-brokered certificates of deposit to partially finance its operating activities. The Financial Services segment issues certificates of deposit in a minimum amount of one hundred thousand dollars in various maturities. At January 2, 2016, the Financial Services segment had $880 million of certificates of deposit outstanding with maturities ranging from January 2016 to July 2023 and with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 2.23%. This outstanding balance compares to $806 million at December 27, 2014, with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 2.25%. For a summary schedule of the contractual maturities of our certificates of deposit for the last two years, please refer to Note 10 Time Deposits\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three years. We cannot assure, however, that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following tables provide summary information concerning our future contractual obligations at January 2, 2016.\n\n (1) Excludes amounts owed under capital lease obligations. \n (2) These amounts do not include estimated interest payments due under our revolving credit facilities or our secured variable funding obligations because the amount that will be borrowed under these facilities in future years is uncertain. \n (3) Includes $182 million of estimated contractual obligations and commitments related to the development, construction, and completion of new retail stores and $50 million in grant funding commitments. \n (4) Our purchase obligations relate primarily to purchases of inventory, shipping, and other goods and services in the ordinary course of business under binding purchase orders or contracts. The amount of purchase obligations shown is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of purchase orders or contracts we had outstanding at the end of 2015. Under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders or contracts, or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders or contracts under applicable laws, the amount of purchase obligations shown in the preceding table would be less. \n (5) Amounts for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, are not reflected in years 2016 through 2020 since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. \nThe following table provides summary information concerning other commercial commitments at January 2, 2016:\n\n (1) Our credit agreement permits the issuance of letters of credit up to $75 million and swing line loans up to $30 million. Our credit agreement for operations in Canada is for $20 million CAD, of which all was available for borrowing at January 2, 2016. \n (2) The line of credit for boat and all-terrain vehicles financing is limited by the $775 million revolving line of credit to $75 million of secured collateral. \n (3) The maximum amount that can be borrowed on the federal funds agreements is $100 million. \n (4) The maximum amount that can be borrowed from third party investors on the variable funding facilities is $1.1 billion.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement\nOperating Leases - We lease various items of office equipment and buildings. Rent expense for these operating leases is recorded in selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Future obligations are shown in the preceding contractual obligations table.\nCredit Card Limits - The Financial Services segment bears off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of its business. One form of this risk is through the Financial Services segment's commitment to extend credit to cardholders up to the maximum amount of their credit limits. The aggregate of such potential funding requirements totaled $35 billion above existing balances at the end of 2015. These funding obligations are not included in our consolidated balance sheet. While the Financial Services segment has not experienced, and does not anticipate that it will experience, a significant draw down of unfunded credit lines by its cardholders, such an event would create a cash need at the Financial Services segment which likely could not be met by our available cash and funding sources. The Financial Services segment has the right to reduce or cancel these available lines of credit at any time.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Cabela's Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates and assumptions. Our estimation processes contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to make these estimates. Should actual results be different than our estimates, we could be exposed to gains or losses from differences that may be material.\nFor a summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the accounting policies discussed below represent accounting policies we apply that are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements.\nMerchandise Revenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized on our Direct sales when merchandise is delivered to the customer with the point of delivery based on our estimate of shipping time from our distribution centers to the customer. We recognize reserves for estimated product returns based upon our historical return experience and expectations. Had our estimate of merchandise in-transit to customers and our estimate of product returns been different by 10% at the end of 2015, our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately $1 million. Sales of gift instruments are recorded in merchandise revenue when the gift instruments are redeemed in exchange for merchandise or services and as a liability prior to redemption. We recognize breakage on gift instruments as revenue when the probability of redemption is remote. Had our estimate of breakage on our recorded liability for gift instruments been different by 10% of the recorded liability at the end of 2015, our merchandise revenue would have been higher or lower by approximately $1 million.\nInventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market. All inventories are finished goods. We estimate the provision for inventory shrinkage based on our historical inventory accuracy rates as determined by periodic and annual cycle counts. The provision for damaged goods from returns is based upon our historical experience. We estimate provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on historical loss, specific identification, product performance statistics, and future merchandising objectives. Had our estimated inventory reserves been different by 10% at the end of 2015, our cost of sales would have been higher or lower by approximately $2 million.\nAllowance for Loan Losses on Credit Cards - The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses and is evaluated by management for adequacy. The measurement of the overall allowance is subject to estimation risk, and the amount of actual losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts. For example, had management's estimate of net losses over the next 12 months been different by 10% at the end of 2015, the Financial Services segment's allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses would have changed by approximately $8 million.\nLong-Lived Assets - Long-lived assets other than goodwill and other intangible assets, which generally are tested separately for impairment on an annual basis, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The calculation for an impairment loss compares the carrying value of the asset to that asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future discounted cash flows, observable market prices, or unobservable market prices. We recognize an impairment loss if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Frequently our impairment loss calculations contain multiple uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting cash flows under different scenarios. We have consistently applied our accounting methodologies that we use to assess impairment loss. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.\nEconomic Development Bonds - On a quarterly basis, we revalue our economic development bonds and evaluate the projected underlying cash flows to determine if the carrying amount of such economic development bonds can be recovered. To the extent the expected cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, the bonds are assessed for impairment. Deficiencies in projected discounted cash flows below the recorded carrying amount of the economic development bonds evidences that we do not expect to recover the cost basis. Consequently, the valuation results in an other than temporary impairment. Had our fair value estimates been lower by 10% at the end of 2015, the value of economic development bonds would have been approximately $8 million less with the unrealized loss reflected in comprehensive income if the loss was deemed to be temporary. Any declines in the fair value of available-for-sale economic development bonds below cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses.\nThere were no other than temporary fair value adjustments of economic development bonds and no adjustments of deferred grant income related to economic development bonds in 2015. However, at the end of 2015, we identified economic development bonds with carrying values of $20 million where the actual tax revenues associated with these properties were lower than previously projected. We will continue to closely monitor the amounts and timing of projected cash flows from the properties related to these economic development bonds.\nIncome Taxes - Income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which we operate and require significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for based on these assessments. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements based on an evaluation of new information. We have not provided United States income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States as of the end of 2015. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related United States tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. We have reserved for potential adjustments to the provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 2 Accounting

"summary": "The following is a summarized version of the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) from Cabela's Incorporated's financial report:\n\nCabela\u2019s Incorporated, including its subsidiaries (\u201cCabela\u2019s\u201d, \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, \u201cus\u201d), is a leading specialty retailer and direct marketer of hunting, fishing, camping, and related outdoor merchandise, operating primarily in North America.\n\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may materially differ. These statements are identified by terms such as \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, and similar expressions.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2015, revenues totaled $4.0 billion, marking a 9.6% increase compared to 2014, with merchandise sales growing by 8.7% and Financial Services revenue increasing by 16.8%. This growth was attributed to a $280 million increase in total merchandise sales and a $72 million increase in Financial Services revenue.\n\nAdditionally, Cabela\u2019s experienced:\n- An increase in Retail revenue by 13.1%, connected to new store openings,\n- A 3.4% consolidated decrease in comparable store sales, and\n- A 3.3% decrease in Direct segment revenue.\n\nThe Financial Services segment saw positive growth resulting from increased interest and fee income due to higher credit card loans, as well as higher interchange income.\n\nIn 2015, Cabela's also faced a decrease in merchandise gross profit margin, dropping 140 basis points primarily due to markdown and pricing strategy, product mix, and sales of lower-margin products. Operating income fell by $28 million, or 8.2%, from the previous year, due to higher operating expenses and impairment charges, coupled with declined revenue in the Direct segment and increased incentive compensation compared to no incentive compensation in 2014. Net income also decreased by 6.1%.\n\nFor anticipated growth, Cabela's intends to:\n- Continuously monitor and respond to factors affecting store sales,\n- Improve store space utilization,\n- Adjust the mix between Cabela\u2019s and national brand products, and \n- Manage inventory levels to meet consumer demands.\n\nCabela\u2019s emphasized an omni-channel retailing approach, continued investments in Cabela\u2019s branded products, and planned to open eight new retail stores in 2016.\n\nCabela\u2019s held $3.9 billion in revenues for a 52-week period in 2015, which was a 7.3% rise compared to 2014. Retail segment revenue increased by 10.3% on an adjusted 52-week basis, but the company experienced underperforming store sales and hence plans to moderate store growth over the next two years.\n\nThe Financial Services segment improved credit card revenue and had growth in the total credit card loans outstanding. In addition, Cabela\u2019s has undertaken multi-year corporate restructuring to decrease operational expenses and increase return on invested capital, identifying savings opportunities across the company.\n\nFinancially, the company operated 77 retail stores at the end of 2015, totaling 7.9 million square feet, with efforts toward distribution center improvements including a new distribution center in Tooele, Utah, and operational changes in Canada.\n\nFor fiscal 2015, revenue from Financial Services grew, active accounts increased, and the operating income of the segment improved. However, operating income from the Direct segment decreased due to a fall in revenue and margin, and retail store expansions did not meet performance expectations, leading to a strategic reassessment.\n\nCabela's future vision, Vision 2020, aims to be the premier omni-channel retailer by delivering exceptional products and customer service. This vision includes the Game Plan for Growth\u201d focusing on core business areas and the Foremost Advantage\u201d, which emphasizes customer experience, product expertise, value, and exceptional products.\n\nCabela\u2019s macroeconomic environment presented challenges in 2015, with increased promotional activity and operating expense controls initiated. The company also highlighted legislative and regulatory developments potentially affecting the business, including issues related to gun control legislation and financial industry reforms potentially impacting the Financial Services segment.\n\nOperational reviews show a reduction in operating income primarily due to the impact of markdowns and pricing strategy, and increased operating expenses reflecting store expansions and severance charges due to restructuring.\n\nIn summary, whilst Cabela\u2019s experienced revenue growth in 2015, operational challenges influenced profit margins, operating income, and net income. Strategic initiatives have been implemented to address these challenges and bolster future growth."}
