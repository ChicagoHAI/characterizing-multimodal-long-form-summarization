Our operating ratio declined 460 basis points to 95.2%. Our adjusted operating ratio (as defined below), a key measure of profitability in our industry, contracted 530 basis points to a 94.7%. These declines were the result of overall softness in freight within the Truckload segment, resulting in a slight decline in miles per tractor per week and a 3.9% decrease in the average tractor count, even considering a 5.3% increase in the number of team tractors, and average rates per total mile declining 2.2 cents per mile. Cost in the Truckload segment increased 8.3 cents per mile, primarily as a result of increased capital cost, resulting from the significant decline in used equipment values and related increase in depreciation. On the contrary, our non-Truckload operations experienced growth in both revenue and profitability as we were able to take advantage of the market dynamics and realize the full year effect of several business model changes and new customers added in 2015. Our consolidated financial results are summarized as follows:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Total revenue was $670.7 million, compared with $724.2 million for 2015, and freight revenue (excludes revenue from fuel surcharge) was $610.8 million, compared with $640.1 million for 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Operating income was $32.4 million, compared with operating income of $67.8 million for 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Net income was $16.8 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared with net income of $42.1 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, for 2015.

Our turnaround efforts at SRT were fully engaged in 2016, including a new management team, and we have established a roadmap that we believe will be successful in returning SRT's results to levels where they produce an acceptable return. We continue to focus on deleveraging the balance sheet resulting in total indebtedness, net of cash and including the present value of off-balance sheet lease obligations decreasing by approximately $37.5 million to $226.7 million, since December 31, 2015. Additionally, earnings and the reduced impact of fuel hedges have increased tangible book value per basic share 16.1% to $12.95 from $11.15 at December 31, 2015.\nIn addition to operating ratio, we use \"adjusted operating ratio\" as a key measure of profitability. Adjusted operating ratio is not a substitute for operating ratio measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted operating ratio means operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge revenue, expressed as a percentage of revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue. We believe the use of adjusted operating ratio allows us to more effectively compare periods, while excluding the potentially volatile effect of changes in fuel prices. Our Board and management focus on our adjusted operating ratio as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of adjusted operating ratio is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that adjusted operating ratio improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define adjusted operating ratio differently. Because of these limitations, adjusted operating ratio should not be considered a measure of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nOperating Ratio\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> Operating Ratio ( OR\u201d) From 2014 to 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP Operating Ratio:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 670,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 718,980\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 638,204\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 95.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 656,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 90.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 679,334\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 94.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,646\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Operating Ratio:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Adj.

In the first half of 2017 we do not expect to match the earnings per share levels we generated for the first and second quarters of 2016. However, we believe the combination of an improving economy, growth of time-sensitive e-commerce freight, industry regulatory changes, retail inventory declines, year-over-year net fuel expense savings from our improved fuel hedge positions, and operational progress at SRT should deliver earnings improvement that result in higher earnings for the second half and potentially the full year of 2017. The largest variable we foresee is the pace and magnitude of improvement at SRT, which we believe could contribute up to $10.0 million of pre-tax income in improved results as compared with 2016. The pace and amount of change will depend, in large part, on our ability to enhance the freight network, which depends on internally re-engineering lanes and a stronger refrigerated freight market. With net capital expenditures scheduled to be below normal due to the timing of our expected replacement cycle, along with anticipated positive operating cash flows, we expect to further reduce balance sheet and off-balance sheet debt over the course of fiscal 2017. Our 2017 plans also include growing our dedicated service line and investing in personnel and trailer tracking equipment that will allow more cross-border freight opportunities.\nRESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) for the periods indicated:\nRevenue\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 610,845\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 640,120\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 578,204\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel surcharge revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 59,806\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 84,120\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 140,776\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 670,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 718,980\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, total revenue decreased $53.6 million, or 7.4%, to $670.7 million from $724.2 million in 2015. Freight revenue decreased $29.3 million, or 4.6%, to $610.8 million for 2016, from $640.1 million in 2015, while fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million year-over-year. The decrease in freight revenue resulted from a $30.4 million decrease in freight revenue from our Truckload segment and a $1.1 million increase in revenues from Solutions.\nThe decrease in 2016 Truckload revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2015 and a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 from approximately 950 teams in 2015.\nThe increase in Solutions' revenue is primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\nFor 2015, total revenue increased $5.3 million, or 0.7%, to $724.2 million from $719.0 million in 2014. Freight revenue increased $61.9 million, or 10.7%, to $640.1 million for 2015, from $578.2 million in 2014, while fuel surcharge revenue decreased $56.7 million year-over-year. The increase in freight revenue resulted from a $49.6 million increase in freight revenue from our Truckload segment and a $12.3 million increase in revenues from Solutions.\nThe increase in 2015 Truckload revenue relates to an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 5.0% compared to 2014 and a $4.6 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as an increase in our average tractor fleet of 3.5% from 2014. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 5.7% increase, or 9.1 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2014. Team driven units increased approximately 13.6% to an average of approximately 950 teams in 2015 from approximately 840 teams in 2014.\nThe increase in Solutions' revenue is primarily the result of additional peak-season freight opportunities during the fourth quarter of 2015, improved coordination with our Truckload segment, and additional business from new customers added during the year.\nIf capacity tightens as a result of regulations impacting the industry or economic growth, we expect the pricing environment to improve in the latter half of 2017 and into 2018 and 2019, offset in part by higher driver pay and other inflationary costs.\nFor comparison purposes in the discussion below, we use total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue. As it relates to the comparison of expenses to freight revenue, we believe removing fuel surcharge revenue, which is sometimes a volatile source of revenue, affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period-to-period. Nonetheless, freight revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not a substitute for revenue measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Our Board and management focus on our freight revenue as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of freight revenue is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that freight revenue improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define freight revenue differently. Because of these limitations, freight revenue should not be considered a measure of total revenue generated by or available to our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries, wages, and related expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 234,526\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 244,779\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,761\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses decreased approximately $10.3 million, or 4.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased to 35.0% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 33.8% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased slightly to 38.4% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 38.2% in 2015. Salaries, wages, and related expenses decreased significantly on an overall dollar basis as a result of a 3.9% decrease in average tractors, but were relatively flat as a percentage of freight revenue, primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2015, partially offset by a decrease in non-driver incentive compensation as a result of reduced profitability in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally, group insurance costs decreased approximately $2.3 million from 2015 as a result of better claims experience.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses increased approximately $13.0 million, or 5.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased to 33.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 32.2% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses declined to 38.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 40.1% in 2014. Salaries, wages, and related expenses increased approximately 2.1 cents per mile primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2014, as well as increased non-driver incentive compensation tied to our results of operations. Additionally, group insurance costs increased approximately $0.9 million from 2014 as a result of more participants and fees directly related to the Affordable Care Act and we had additional costs of approximately $1.0 million due to an increase in non-driver headcount as a result of the increased average number of units. These increases were partially offset by lower workers' compensation expense in 2015 at 1.7 cents per company mile compared to 3.4 cents in 2014 due to fewer claims with less severity. Additionally, we had an increase in the percentage of our fleet comprised of independent contractors, whose costs are included in the purchased transportation line item.\nGoing forward, we believe salaries, wages, and related expenses will increase as a result of a tight driver market, wage inflation, higher healthcare costs, and, in certain periods, increased incentive compensation due to better performance. In particular, we expect driver pay to increase as we look to reduce the number of unseated tractors in our fleet in a tight market for drivers. Additionally, when the freight market allows for an increase in rates we would expect to, as we have historically, pass a portion of those rate increases on to our professional drivers. Salaries, wages, and related expenses will fluctuate to some extent based on the percentage of revenue generated by independent contractors and our Solutions business, for which payments are reflected in the purchased transportation line item.\nFuel expense\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,108\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,160\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 168,856\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe receive a fuel surcharge on our loaded miles from most shippers; however, this does not cover the entire increase in fuel prices for several reasons, including the following: surcharges cover only loaded miles we operate; surcharges do not cover miles driven out-of-route by our drivers; and surcharges typically do not cover refrigeration unit fuel usage or fuel burned by tractors while idling. Moreover, most of our business relating to shipments obtained from freight brokers does not carry a fuel surcharge. Finally, fuel surcharges vary in the percentage of reimbursement offered, and not all surcharges fully compensate for fuel price increases even on loaded miles.\nThe rate of fuel price changes also can have an impact on results. Most fuel surcharges are based on the average fuel price as published by the DOE for the week prior to the shipment, meaning we typically bill customers in the current week based on the previous week's applicable index. Therefore, in times of increasing fuel prices, we do not recover as much as we are currently paying for fuel. In periods of declining prices, the opposite is true. Fuel prices as measured by the DOE averaged approximately $0.40 cents per gallon lower in 2016 compared with 2015 and $1.12 per gallon lower in 2015 compared to 2014.\nAdditionally, $16.7 million, $15.3 million, and $3.1 million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to our results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, as additional fuel expense for 2016, 2015 and 2014, related to losses on fuel hedge contracts that expired. We evaluate these contracts for \"hedge effectiveness,\" which is the extent to which the hedge contract effectively offsets changes in cash flows that the contract was intended to offset. In addition to the amounts reclassified as a result of expired contracts, we recognized a reduction of fuel expense of $1.4 million relating to previously recognized fuel expense as a result of the expiration of the fuel hedge contracts for which the fuel hedging relationship was deemed to be ineffective on a prospective basis in 2014. As a result, the changes in fair value for those contracts were recorded as expense rather than as a component of other comprehensive loss. At December 31, 2016, all fuel hedge contracts were deemed to be effective and thus continue to qualify as cash flow hedges. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded on the contracts that existed at December 31, 2016. The ineffectiveness was calculated using the cumulative dollar offset method as an estimate of the difference in the expected cash flows of the respective fuel hedge contracts compared to the changes in the all-in cash outflows required for the diesel fuel purchases.\nTo measure the effectiveness of our fuel surcharge program, we subtract fuel surcharge revenue (other than the fuel surcharge revenue we reimburse to independent contractors and other third parties, which is included in purchased transportation) from our fuel expense. The result is referred to as net fuel expense. Our net fuel expense as a percentage of freight revenue is affected by the cost of diesel fuel net of fuel surcharge collection, the percentage of miles driven by company tractors, our fuel economy, and our percentage of deadhead miles, for which we do not receive material fuel surcharge revenues.

As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.9% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 19.1% in 2015. These decreases primarily related to lower fuel prices and an increase in our average fuel miles per gallon during 2016 as a result of purchasing equipment with more fuel-efficient engines. The decreases were partially offset by increased net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $16.7 million in 2016 compared to $13.9 million in 2015.\nNet fuel expense increased $3.7 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense increased 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. These increases primarily resulted from lower fuel surcharge recovery as a result of increased broker freight and the tiered reimbursement structure of certain fuel surcharge agreements. The increases were partially offset by improved miles per gallon due to new engine technology, internal fuel efficiency initiatives, and a greater percentage of miles driven by independent contractors.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, total fuel expense decreased approximately $46.7 million, or 27.7%, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.9% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 23.5% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 19.1% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 29.2% in 2014. These decreases primarily related to an increase in our average fuel miles per gallon during 2015 as a result of purchasing equipment with more fuel-efficient engines. The decreases were partially offset by net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $13.9 million in 2015 compared to $3.1 million in 2014. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2014 we recognized an approximately $0.9 million fuel tax credit related to amended fuel tax returns for the years 2010 - 2013.\nNet fuel expense increased $6.9 million, or 17.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense increased 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. These increases primarily resulted from lower fuel surcharge recovery. The increases were partially offset by improved miles per gallon due to new engine technology, internal fuel efficiency initiatives, a greater percentage of miles driven by independent contractors, and an approximately $0.9 million fuel tax credit taken during the second quarter of 2014 related to amended fuel tax returns for the years 2010 - 2013.\nWe expect to continue managing our idle time and tractor speeds, investing in more fuel-efficient tractors to improve our miles per gallon, locking in fuel hedges when deemed appropriate, and partnering with customers to adjust fuel surcharge programs that are inadequate to recover a fair portion of fuel costs. Going forward, our net fuel expense is expected to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue based on factors such as diesel fuel prices, percentage recovered from fuel surcharge programs, percentage of uncompensated miles, percentage of revenue generated by team-driven tractors (which tend to generate higher miles and lower revenue per mile, thus proportionately more fuel cost as a percentage of revenue), percentage of revenue generated by refrigerated operation (which uses diesel fuel for refrigeration, but usually does not recover fuel surcharges on refrigeration fuel), percentage of revenue generated from independent contractors, the success of fuel efficiency initiatives, and gains and losses on fuel hedging contracts.\nGiven recent historical lows, we would expect diesel fuel prices to remain flat or increase over the next few years. However, due to hedging contracts being locked in at a lower rate on a portion of our expected gallons compared to 2016 and 2015, we expect net fuel cost to significantly decline in 2017 and 2018.\nOperations and maintenance\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operations and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,864\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,251\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperations and maintenance decreased $0.6 million, or 1.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015.

As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance increased to 7.5% of freight revenue for 2016, from 7.3% in 2015 due to an increase in unloading and other operational costs associated with our increase in dedicated freight, partially offset by lower maintenance cost on our revenue equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, operations and maintenance decreased $0.8 million, or 1.7%, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, operations and maintenance remained relatively even at 6.4% of total revenue in 2015, compared with 6.6% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance decreased to 7.3% of freight revenue for 2015, from 8.2% in 2014 due to a decrease in our average age of equipment partially offset by increased driver recruiting costs.\nGoing forward, we believe this category will fluctuate based on several factors, including our continued ability to maintain a relatively young fleet, accident severity and frequency, weather, and the reliability of new and untested revenue equipment models.\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,472\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,583\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 111,772\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased approximately $1.1 million, or 0.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 17.5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 16.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 19.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 18.5% in 2015. These changes were primarily the result of a $0.7 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers related to increased revenues at our Solutions subsidiary and growth of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in leased equipment rental payments due to a reduction in our trailers under operating leases from 2,239 at December 31, 2105 to 1,695 at December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased approximately $6.8 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 16.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 15.5% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased to 18.5% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 19.3% in 2014. These changes were primarily the result of a $14.4 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers related to increased revenues at our Solutions subsidiary, growth of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering and an increase in payments to independent contractors, which comprised a larger percentage of our total fleet. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in leased equipment rental payments and by lower fuel surcharge pass-through payments to independent contractors and third party carriers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, miles run by independent contractors increased to 9.0% of our total miles from 8.2% for 2014, and tractors under operating leases decreased to 115 units from 150 units in 2014. We expect revenue equipment rentals to decrease going forward as a result of our increase in acquisition of revenue equipment through financed purchases or capital leases rather than operating leases. As discussed below, this decrease may be partially or fully offset by an increase in purchased transportation as we expect to continue to grow our Solutions and intermodal service offerings.\nWe expect purchased transportation to increase as we seek to grow our Solutions subsidiary and if fuel prices continue to increase, which would result in an increase in what we pay third party carriers and independent contractors. However, this expense category will fluctuate with the number and percentage of loads hauled by independent contractors, loads handled by Solutions, and tractors, trailers, and other assets financed with operating leases. In addition, factors such as the cost to obtain third party transportation services, and growth of our intermodal service offerings, and the amount of fuel surcharge revenue passed through to the third party carriers and independent contractors will affect this expense category. If industry-wide trucking capacity were to tighten in relation to freight demand, we may need to increase the amounts we pay to third-party transportation providers, independent contractors, and intermodal transportation providers, which could increase this expense category on an absolute basis and as a percentage of freight revenue absent an offsetting increase in revenue. We continue to actively recruit independent contractors and, if we are successful, we would expect this line item to increase as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating taxes and licenses\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating taxes and licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,712\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,960\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the periods presented, the change in operating taxes and licenses was not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nInsurance and claims\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance and claims\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,596\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,909\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,594\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInsurance and claims, consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability, physical damage, and cargo damage insurance and claims, increased approximately $0.7 million, or 2.2%, for year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015.

As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims increased to 5.3% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 5.0% in 2015. These increases are primarily related to the non-recurring $3.6 million benefit in the second quarter of 2015 from commutation of our auto liability policy for the period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014. These increases also resulted from increased accident severity, resulting in total insurance cost increasing to 10.3 cents per mile for 2016 from 9.6 cents per mile in 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreased accident rates in 2016, as measured by a 6.8% improvement in DOT reportable accidents per million miles driven at 0.82% - the second lowest in the last ten years.\nInsurance and claims decreased approximately $7.7 million, or 19.4%, for year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, insurance and claims decreased to 4.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 5.5% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims decreased to 5.0% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 6.8% in 2014. These decreases are primarily related to the difference between the approximately $7.5 million of additional reserves related to the adverse judgment in 2014 regarding a 2008 cargo claim compared with the $3.6 million benefit in the second quarter of 2015 from commutation of our auto liability policy for the period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014. Excluding the 2008 cargo claim, insurance and claims cost per mile decreased to 9.6 cents per mile in 2015 from 9.9 cents per mile in 2014.\nOur auto liability (personal injury and property damage), cargo, and general liability insurance programs include significant self-insured retention amounts. The auto liability policy contains a feature whereby we are able to retroactively obtain a partial refund of the premium in exchange for taking on the liability for incidents that occurred during the period and releasing the insurers. This is referred to as \"commuting\" the policy or \"policy commutation.\" In several past periods, including the policy period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014, we have commuted the policy, which has lowered our insurance and claims expense. We are also self-insured for physical damage to our equipment. Because of these significant self-insured exposures, insurance and claims expense may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period. Any increase in frequency or severity of claims, or any increases to then-existing reserves, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In relation to the 2008 cargo claim reserve, the judgment was partially reversed and the proceedings were remanded to the district court for further factual determinations. If these further proceedings are resolved favorably to us, any reduction of the accrual could reduce insurance and claims expense in the period in which the claim is resolved. On the other hand, if we are not successful in such a finding or mediation, insurance and claims expense may increase as a result of continuing litigation expenses, including pre and post judgment interest. We periodically evaluate strategies to efficiently reduce our insurance and claims expense, which in the past has included the commutation of our auto liability insurance policy. We intend to evaluate our ability to commute the current policy and any such commutation could significantly impact insurance and claims expense.\nCommunications and utilities\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Communications and utilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,057\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,162\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,806\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the periods presented, the changes in communications and utilities were not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nGeneral supplies and expenses\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General supplies and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,413\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,007\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,950\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, general supplies and expenses increased approximately $0.4 million, or 2.9%, compared with 2015.

Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $9.6 million in 2016 from 2015, primarily as a result of more owned equipment and a significant reduction on the value of used tractors resulting in a change to residual values. Losses on the disposal of property and equipment, totaled $0.8 million in 2016, compared to gains of $0.6 million in 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, depreciation and amortization increased $15.0 million, or 32.3%, compared with 2014.

As a percentage of freight revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 9.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 8.0% in 2014. Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $13.0 million in 2015 from 2014, primarily as a result of new equipment and an increase in owned tractors of approximately 500 due to a reduction in use of operating leases to finance revenue equipment. Gains on the disposal of property and equipment, totaling $0.6 million in 2015, were $2.0 million lower than 2014 due to the number, type, and mileage of the equipment sold. Additionally, depreciation increased and gains on the disposal of property and equipment decreased as a result of the softening of the used tractor market during the latter portion of the year.\nWe expect to see an increase in depreciation and amortization going forward, specifically as compared to the first and second quarters of 2016, as we continue to recognize the impact of the significant reductions in residual values, which should lessen on a comparative basis in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, if the used tractor market were to decline further, we could have to adjust residual values again and increase depreciation or experience increased losses on sale.\nInterest expense, net\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,226\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,445\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,794\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net includes interest expense, interest income, and other miscellaneous non-operating items, which decreased approximately $0.2 million, or 2.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015.

As a percentage of total revenue, other expense, net remained relatively even with 2014 at 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, other expense, net decreased to 1.3% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. These decreases are primarily the result of the repayments of debt and capital leases from the proceeds of our late November 2014 follow-on stock offering partially offset by the increase in debt at a lower average interest rate related to the August 2015 purchase of our corporate headquarters.\nThis line item will fluctuate based on our decision with respect to purchasing revenue equipment with balance sheet debt versus operating leases as well as our ability to continue to generate profitable results and reduce our leverage.\nEquity in income of affiliate\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity in income of affiliate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,570\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,730\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have accounted for our investment in TEL using the equity method of accounting and thus our financial results include our proportionate share of TEL's net income. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the increase in TEL's contributions to our results was due to their growth in both leasing and tractor sales. Given TEL's growth during the three years preceding 2015 and volatility in the used and leased equipment markets in which TEL operates, including the recent softening of the used tractor market, the impact on our earnings resulting from our investment and TEL's profitability was more moderate in 2016. Given the decline in the used and leased equipment markets in which TEL operates, we expect the impact on our earnings resulting from our investment in TEL to moderate over the next twelve months.\nIncome tax expense\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,386\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,822\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,774\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense decreased approximately $11.4 million, or 52.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, income tax expense decreased to 1.5% of total revenue for 2016 from 3.0% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, income tax expense decreased to 1.7% of freight revenue for 2016 compared to 3.4% in 2015. These decreases were primarily related to the $36.7 million decrease in pre-tax income in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting from the declines in operating income noted above, the decrease in the contribution from TEL's earnings, and the large non-recurring tax credit in fiscal year 2015.\nIncome tax expense increased approximately $7.0 million, or 47.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, income tax expense increased to 3.0% of total revenue for 2015 from 2.1% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, income tax expense increased to 3.4% of freight revenue for 2015 compared to 2.6% in 2014. These increases were primarily related to the $31.3 million increase in the pre-tax income in 2015 compared to 2014 resulting from the improvements in operating income noted above, a one-time federal income tax credit of approximately $4.7 million, and the increase in the contribution from TEL's earnings.\nThe effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due primarily to permanent differences related to our per diem pay structure for drivers. Due to the partial nondeductible effect of the per diem payments, our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates.\nRESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS\nWe have one reportable segment, truckload services, which we refer to as Truckload. In addition, our Solutions subsidiary has service offerings ancillary to our Truckload services, including: freight brokerage and logistics service directly and through freight brokerage agents who are paid a commission for the freight they provide and accounts receivable factoring. These operations consist of several operating segments, which neither individually nor in the aggregate meet the quantitative or qualitative reporting thresholds. As a result, these operations are grouped in \"Other.\" The operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\"Unallocated Corporate Overhead\" includes costs that are incidental to our activities and are not specifically allocated to one of the segments. The following table summarizes financial and operating data by segment:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Truckload\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 601,226\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 655,918\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 663,001\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 69,425\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 68,322\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 55,979\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 670,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 718,980\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income (loss):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Truckload\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,031\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,107\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,151\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,631\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,768\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,894\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated Corporate Overhead\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12,215\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12,093\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (18,399\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,646\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nOur Truckload revenue decreased $54.7 million, as freight revenue decreased $30.4 million and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million. The decrease in freight revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2016, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Additionally, team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 compared to approximately 950 in 2015.\nOur Truckload operating income was $37.1 million less in 2016 than 2015 due to the abovementioned decrease in freight revenue. Additionally, operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, increased primarily due to increased salaries, wages, and related expenses (which was primarily due to a higher percentage of our fleet being comprised of team-driven tractors, as well as driver and non-driver employee pay increases since the same 2015 period), increased net fuel expense, and increased capital costs, partially offset by reduced workers' compensation expense and operations and maintenance expense.\nOther total revenue increased $1.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and operating income increased $1.9 million for the same period. These improvements are primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\nUnallocated corporate overhead remained relatively flat as a result of a $3.2 million reduction in incentive compensation in 2016, primarily as a result of decreased profitability, partially offset by the 2015 period including the $3.6 million in return of previously expensed insurance premiums for the commutation of our primary auto liability policy for the period of April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOur Truckload revenue decreased $7.1 million, as freight revenue increased $49.6 million and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $56.7 million. The increase in freight revenue relates to an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 5.0% compared to 2014 and a $4.6 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as an increase in our average tractor fleet of 3.5% from 2014. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 5.7% increase, or 9.1 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2014. Additionally, team driven units increased approximately 13.6% to an average of approximately 950 teams in 2015 compared to approximately 840 in 2014.\nOur Truckload operating income was $20.0 million higher in 2015 than 2014 due to the abovementioned increase in freight revenue. Additionally, operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, decreased primarily due to reduced workers' compensation expense and operations and maintenance expense partially offset by increased salaries, wages, and related expenses (which was primarily due to a higher percentage of our fleet being comprised of team-driven tractors, as well as driver and nondriver employee pay increases since the same 2014 period), increased net fuel expense, and increased capital costs.\nOther total revenue increased $12.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and operating income increased $1.9 million for the same period. These improvements are primarily the result of additional peak season freight opportunities during the fourth quarter of 2015, improved coordination with our Truckload segment, and additional business from new customers added during the year.\nThe reduction in unallocated corporate overhead primarily includes $3.6 million in return of previously expensed insurance premiums for the commutation of our primary auto liability policy for the period of April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014, and the $1.4 million reduction in fuel expense related to the ineffective fuel hedge contracts fulfilled in 2015 that were deemed to be ineffective on a prospective basis in 2014.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur business requires significant capital investments over the short-term and the long-term. Recently, we have financed our capital requirements with borrowings under our Credit Facility, cash flows from operations, long-term operating leases, capital leases, secured installment notes with finance companies, and proceeds from the sale of our used revenue equipment. We had working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) of $47.9 million and $46.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Based on our expected financial condition, net capital expenditures, results of operations, related net cash flows, installment notes, and other sources of financing, we believe our working capital and sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our current and projected needs and we do not expect to experience material liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $12.2 million of borrowings outstanding, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately $27.2 million, and available borrowing capacity of $55.6 million under the Credit Facility. Fluctuations in the outstanding balance and related availability under our Credit Facility are driven primarily by cash flows from operations and the timing and nature of property and equipment additions that are not funded through notes payable, as well as the nature and timing of collection of accounts receivable, payments of accrued expenses, and receipt of proceeds from disposals of property and equipment.\nWith an average tractor fleet age of 1.8 years, we believe we have flexibility to manage our fleet and we plan to regularly evaluate our tractor replacement cycle, new tractor purchase requirements, and financing options.\nCash Flows\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $102.4 million in 2016 compared with $85.5 million in 2015 primarily due to the change in receivables and advances as a result of increased cash collected during 2016 related to increased 2015 year-end revenues, and the fluctuation in tax benefit/expense due to the reversal of deferred tax effects on amounts in other comprehensive income. This improvement is partially offset by net income of $16.8 million in 2016 compared to net income of $42.1 million in 2015, depreciation and amortization increasing $9.6 million in 2016, primarily as the result of the reduced residual revenue equipment value projections due to the softened used equipment market and the 2015 purchase of our previously leased Chattanooga headquarters property, and the 2015 return of $5.0 million which was previously provided by us to certain of our derivative counterparties related to the net liability position of certain of our fuel derivative instruments. The fluctuations in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily related to the timing of payments on our accrued expenses and trade accounts in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.\nNet cash flows used by investing activities were $47.3 million in 2016 compared with $147.7 million in 2015. The $100.4 million decrease in net investing activities was attributable primarily to the purchase of our corporate headquarters property in Chattanooga, Tennessee during 2015 for approximately $35.5 million, as well as a $22.9 million decrease in assets held for sale due to the timing of dispositions of used revenue equipment. During 2017 we plan to take delivery of approximately 485 new company tractors and dispose of approximately 460 used tractors. This compares to the approximately 650 new company tractors we took delivery of and the approximately 1,074 used tractors we disposed of during 2016, including 365 recorded as assets held for sale at December 31, 2015. Going forward, cash flows from disposals of equipment could be more volatile given the weakness in the used tractor market.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $51.9 million in 2016, compared with net cash flows provided by financing activities of $45.4 million in 2015. The change in net cash flows used in financing activities was primarily a function of net repayments of notes payable and the balance under our Credit Facility. These changes primarily relate to the trade cycle of our revenue equipment, including the impact of deferring receipt of proceeds of 350 tractors held for sale that were under contract to be sold in the first quarter of 2016, and cash flows from investing and operating activities discussed above. Going forward, our cash flows may fluctuate depending on the resolution of the 2008 cargo claim, future stock repurchases, and the extent of future income tax obligations.\nMaterial Debt Agreements\nWe and substantially all of our subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Borrowers\") are parties to a Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the \"Credit Facility\") with Bank of America, N.A., as agent (the \"Agent\") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPM,\" and together with the Agent, the \"Lenders\").\nThe Credit Facility is a $95.0 million revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted accordion feature that, so long as no event of default exists, allows us to request an increase in the revolving credit facility of up to $50.0 million, subject to Lender acceptance of the additional funding commitment. The Credit Facility includes, within our $95.0 million revolving credit facility, a letter of credit sub facility in an aggregate amount of $95.0 million and a swing line sub facility in an aggregate amount equal to the greater of $10.0 million or 10% of the Lenders' aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility from time-to-time.\nIn 2015, we entered into an eleventh amendment to the Credit Facility, which, among other things, (i) amended the \"Applicable Margin\" to improve the interest rate grid, (ii) improved the unused line fee pricing to 0.25% per annum, retroactive to July 1, 2015 (previously the fee was 0.375% per annum when availability was less than $50.0 million and 0.5% per annum when availability was at or over such amount), (iii) required each of Driven Analytic Solutions, LLC (\"DAS\") and Covenant Properties, LLC (\"CPI\") to be joined to the Credit Agreement as guarantors, (iv) required each of DAS, CPI and Star Properties Exchange, LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company, to pledge certain of its assets as security, (v) contained conditional amendments increasing the borrowing base real estate sublimit and lowering the amortization of the real estate sublimit, (vi) made technical amendments to a variety of sections, including without limitation, permitted investments, permitted stock repurchases, permitted indebtedness, and permitted liens, (vii) consented to our purchase of our headquarters, including related financing, and (viii) extended the maturity date from September 2017 to September 2018. In exchange for these amendments, we agreed to pay fees of $0.2 million. In 2016, we entered into the twelfth and thirteenth amendments to the Credit Facility, which among other things (i) increases the approved amount for share repurchases to $45.0 million, subject to certain limitations based on the available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, and (ii) permitted the formation of Heritage Insurance, Inc., and substituted certain language to ensure the federal funds rate or LIBOR would not be less than zero.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as either \"base rate loans\" or \"LIBOR loans.\" Base rate loans accrue interest at a base rate equal to the greater of the Agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.0%; while LIBOR loans accrue interest at LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.0%. The applicable rates are adjusted quarterly based on average pricing availability. The unused line fee is the product of 0.25% times the average daily amount by which the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility exceed the outstanding principal amount of revolver loans and the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. The obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets, with the notable exclusion of any real estate or revenue equipment pledged under other financing agreements, including revenue equipment installment notes and capital leases.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base limited to the lesser of (A) $95.0 million, minus the sum of the stated amount of all outstanding letters of credit; or (B) the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) the lesser of (a) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible revenue equipment, (b) 95% of the net book value of eligible revenue equipment, or (c) 35% of the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility, plus (iii) the lesser of (a) $25.0 million or (b) 65% of the appraised fair market value of eligible real estate. We had $12.2 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately $27.2 million, and available borrowing capacity of $55.6 million. The interest rate on outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2016, was 2.3% on $9.0 million of base rate loans and 4.3% on $3.2 million of LIBOR loans. Based on availability as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no fixed charge coverage requirement.\nThe Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for a facility of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the Credit Facility may be accelerated, and the Lenders' commitments may be terminated. If an event of default occurs under the Credit Facility and the Lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Credit Facility to become due and payable, this could result in a default under other debt instruments that contain acceleration or cross-default provisions. The Credit Facility contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to, among other things, debt, dividends, liens, acquisitions and dispositions outside of the ordinary course of business, and affiliate transactions. Failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions set forth in the Credit Facility could result in an event of default.\nCapital lease obligations are utilized to finance a portion of our revenue equipment and are entered into with certain finance companies who are not parties to our Credit Facility. The leases in effect at December 31, 2016 terminate in January 2017 through December 2022 and contain guarantees of the residual value of the related equipment by us. As such, the residual guarantees are included in the related debt balance as a balloon payment at the end of the related term as well as included in the future minimum capital lease payments. These lease agreements require us to pay personal property taxes, maintenance, and operating expenses.\nPricing for the revenue equipment installment notes is quoted by the respective financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders at the funding of each group of equipment acquired and include fixed annual rates for new equipment under retail installment contracts. The notes included in the funding are due in monthly installments with final maturities at various dates ranging from January 2017 to January 2022. The notes contain certain requirements regarding payment, insuring of collateral, and other matters, but do not have any financial or other material covenants or events of default except certain notes totaling $166.1 million are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additionally, certain of our fuel hedge contracts totaling $3.6 million at December 31, 2016, are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additional borrowings from the financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders are expected to be available to fund new tractors expected to be delivered in 2017, while any other property and equipment purchases, including trailers, are expected to be funded with a combination of available cash, notes, operating leases, capital leases, and/or from the Credit Facility.\nIn August 2015, we financed a portion of the purchase of our corporate headquarters, a maintenance facility, and certain surrounding property in Chattanooga, Tennessee by entering into a $28.0 million variable rate note with a third party lender. Concurrently with entering into the note, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively fix the related interest rate to 4.2%. See Note 13 for further information about the interest rate swap.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> Payments due by period:\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(less than\n1 year)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(1-3 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(1-3 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3-5 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3-5 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMore than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue equipment and property installment notes, including interest (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 207,687\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,087\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,643\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,010\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,892\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,352\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,703\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,456\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,135\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,047\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,844\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,526\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,062\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,062\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,062\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,284\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,508\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,548\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease residual value guarantees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,968\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,961\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,007\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,549\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,549\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 340,186\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,713\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,923\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,606\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,860\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,251\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents principal and interest payments owed at December 31, 2016.

Refer to Notes 7 and 8, \"Debt\" and \"Leases,\" respectively, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (5)\n</td> <td> Excludes any amounts accrued for unrecognized tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of such unrecognized tax benefits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOperating leases are an important source of financing for our revenue equipment and certain real estate. At December 31, 2016, we had financed 135 tractors and 1,695 trailers under operating leases. Vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our consolidated balance sheets, and lease payments, in respect of such vehicles, are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the line item \"Revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation.\" Our revenue equipment rental expense was $10.6 million in 2016, compared with $12.4 million in 2015. The total value of remaining payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2016, was approximately $17.5 million. In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. The residual guarantees expire between August 2018 and February 2019 and had an undiscounted value of approximately $4.0 million at December 31, 2016. The discounted present value of the total remaining lease payments and residual value guarantees were approximately $18.7 million at December 31, 2016. We expect our residual guarantees to approximate the market value at the end of the lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make decisions based upon estimates, assumptions, and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances. Such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application, the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures. Changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those anticipated. A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the consolidated financial statements attached hereto. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue, drivers' wages, and other direct operating expenses generated by our Truckload reportable segment are recognized on the date shipments are delivered to the customer. Revenue includes transportation revenue, fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention, and other accessorial services.\nRevenue generated by our Solutions subsidiary is recognized upon completion of the services provided. Revenue is recorded on a gross basis, without deducting third party purchased transportation costs, as we act as a principal with substantial risks as primary obligor, except for transactions whereby equipment from our Truckload segment perform the related services, which we record on a net basis in accordance with the related authoritative guidance. Solutions revenue includes $2.6 million, $2.4 million, and $2.3 million of revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, related to an accounts receivable factoring business. Revenue for this business is recognized on a net basis, given we are acting as an agent and are not the primary obligor in these transactions.\nDepreciation of Revenue Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for book purposes is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, while depreciation for tax purposes is generally recorded using an accelerated method. Depreciation of revenue equipment is our largest item of depreciation. We generally depreciate new tractors (excluding day cabs) over five years to salvage values of approximately 15% of their cost and new trailers over seven years for refrigerated trailers and ten years for dry van trailers to salvage values of approximately 25% of their cost. We annually review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long-lived assets based upon, among other things, our experience with similar assets, conditions in the used revenue equipment market, and prevailing industry practice. Over the past several years, the price of new tractors has risen dramatically and there has been significant volatility in the used equipment market. As a result of the progressive decline in the market value of used tractors and our expectations that used tractor prices will not rebound in the near term, effective July 1, 2016 we reduced the salvage values on our tractors and, thus, prospectively increased depreciation expense. Estimates around the salvage values and useful lives for trailers remain unchanged. The impact in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 is approximately $2.0 million of additional depreciation expense per quarter or approximately $1.2 million per quarter net of tax, which represents approximately $0.06 per common or diluted share. Based on the prospective nature of this change, we expect depreciation and expense, including gains and losses, to approximate those levels of the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Changes in the useful life or salvage value estimates, or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates, could have a material effect on our results of operations. Gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn 2016 we had a net loss on revenue equipment of $0.8 million, and in 2015 and 2014 we generated net gains on revenue equipment, including assets held for sale, of $0.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively. We review salvage values of our revenue equipment annually and make adjustments periodically, based on trends in the used equipment market, to reflect updated estimates of fair value at disposal.\nWe lease certain revenue equipment under capital leases with terms of approximately 60 to 84 months. Amortization of leased assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense.\nPursuant to applicable accounting standards, revenue equipment and other long-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates impairment may exist. Expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred. If the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long-lived asset, then an impairment loss is recognized. We measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised value of the assets, as appropriate.\nAlthough a portion of our tractors are protected by non-binding indicative trade-in values or binding trade-back agreements with the manufacturers, some tractors and substantially all of our owned trailers continue to be subject to fluctuations in market prices for used revenue equipment. Moreover, our trade-back agreements are contingent upon reaching acceptable terms for the purchase of new equipment. Further declines in the price of used revenue equipment or failure to reach agreement for the purchase of new tractors with the manufacturers issuing trade-back agreements could result in impairment of, or losses on the sale of, revenue equipment. Historically, only a de minimus percentage of our equipment has been sold back to the dealers pursuant to the trade back agreements as we have generally found that market prices exceeded the trade back allowances, although in recent years, trade back allowances have increased as a result of the increasing cost of the underlying equipment.\nAssets Held For Sale\nAssets held for sale include property and revenue equipment no longer utilized in continuing operations which are available and held for sale. Assets held for sale are no longer subject to depreciation, and are recorded at the lower of depreciated book value or fair market value less selling costs. We periodically review the carrying value of these assets for possible impairment. We expect to sell these assets within twelve months.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe classify intangible assets into two categories: (i) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization and (ii) goodwill. We have no goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We test intangible assets with definite lives for impairment if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. We record an impairment charge when the carrying value of the definite lived intangible asset is not recoverable by the cash flows generated from the use of the asset.\nWe determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement, the history of the asset, our long-term strategy for the use of the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, generally on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, ranging from 4 to 20 years. We have no identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016, and $0.2 million at December 31, 2015, which was recorded in other assets.\nInsurance and Other Claims\nThe primary claims arising against us consist of auto liability (personal injury and property damage), workers' compensation, cargo, commercial liability, and employee medical expenses. Our insurance program involves self-insurance with the following risk retention levels (before giving effect to any commutation of an auto liability policy):\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> auto liability - $1.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> workers' compensation - $1.3 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> cargo - $0.3 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> employee medical - $0.4 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> physical damage - 100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to our significant self-insured retention amounts, we have exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims and to variations between our estimated and actual ultimate payouts. We accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims and an estimate for allocated loss adjustment expenses including legal and other direct costs associated with a claim. Estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, the size of any potential damage award based on factors such as the specific facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, the prospect of punitive damages, future medical costs, and inflation estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. We have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to estimates within our self-insured retention layers, we also must make judgments concerning claims where we have third party insurance and for claims outside our coverage limits. Upon settling claims and expenses associated with claims where we have third party coverage, we are generally required to initially fund payment to the claimant and seek reimbursement from the insurer. Receivables from insurers for claims and expenses we have paid on behalf of insurers were $0.7 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in drivers' advances and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we accrue claims above our self-insured retention and record a corresponding receivable for amounts we expect to collect from insurers upon settlement of such claims. We have less than $0.1 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a receivable in other assets and as a corresponding accrual in the long-term portion of insurance and claims accruals on our consolidated balance sheet for claims above our self-insured retention for which we believe it is reasonably assured that the insurers will provide their portion of such claims. We evaluate collectability of the receivables based on the credit worthiness and surplus of the insurers, along with our prior experience and contractual terms with each. If any claim occurrence were to exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. If one or more claims were to exceed our then effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also make judgments regarding the ultimate benefit versus risk to commuting certain periods within our auto liability policy. If we commute a policy, we assume 100% risk for covered claims in exchange for a policy refund. In April 2015, we commuted two liability policies for the period from April 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014, such that we are now responsible for any claim that occurred during that period up to $20.0 million, should such a claim develop. We recorded a $3.6 million reduction in insurance and claims expense in the second quarter of 2015 related to the commutation. The insurer did not remit the premium refund directly to the Company, but rather applied a credit to the current auto liability insurance policy, such that we recorded the policy release premium refund as a prepaid asset at June 30, 2015.\nEffective April 2015, we entered into new auto liability policies with a three-year term. As a result of the commutation and the Company's improved safety statistics over the prior policy, the Company received favorable premium pricing for the policy period, which we expect will reduce the fixed portion of insurance expense during such period. The policy includes a limit for a single loss of $9.0 million, an aggregate of $18.0 million for each policy year, and a $30.0 million aggregate for the three-year period ended March 31, 2018. The policy includes a policy release premium refund of up to $13.6 million, less any future amounts paid on claims by the insurer, from October 1, 2014 through March 31, 2018, if we were to commute the policy for the entire three years. A decision with respect to commutation of the policy cannot be made before April 1, 2018, unless both we and the insurance carrier agree to a commutation prior to the end of the policy term. Management cannot predict whether or not future claims or the development of existing claims will justify a commutation, and accordingly, no related amounts were recorded at December 31, 2016.\nIf claims development factors that are based upon historical experience change by 10%, our claims accrual as of December 31, 2016, would change by approximately $1.1 million.\nLease Accounting and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\nWe issue residual value guarantees in connection with the operating leases we enter into for certain of our revenue equipment. These leases provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. To the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee, we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases. The estimated values at lease termination involve management judgments. As leases are entered into, determination as to the classification as an operating or capital lease involves management judgments on residual values and useful lives.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We believe the future tax deductions will be realized principally through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, except for when a valuation allowance has been provided.\nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nStock-Based Employee Compensation\nWe issue several types of stock-based compensation, including awards that vest based on service and performance conditions or a combination of the conditions. Performance-based awards vest contingent upon meeting certain performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee. All awards require future service and thus forfeitures are estimated based on historical forfeitures and the remaining term until the related award vests. For performance-based awards, determining the appropriate amount to expense in each period is based on likelihood and timing of achieving the stated targets and requires judgment, including forecasting future financial results. The estimates are revised periodically based on the probability and timing of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate. Awards that are only subject to time vesting provisions are amortized using the straight-line method.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, commodity contracts, accounts payable, debt, and interest rate swaps. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current debt approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the factored receivables approximates the fair value, as the receivables are generally repaid directly to us by the client's customer within 30-40 days due to the combination of the short-term nature of the financing transaction and the underlying quality of the receivables. Interest rates that are currently available to us for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of our long-term debt, which primarily consists of revenue equipment installment notes. The fair value of our revenue equipment installment notes approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2016, as the weighted average interest rate on these notes approximates the market rate for similar debt. Borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility approximate fair value due to the variable interest rate on the facility. Additionally, commodity contracts, which are accounted for as hedge derivatives, as discussed in Note 13, are valued based on the forward rate of the specific indices upon which the contract is being settled and adjusted for counterparty credit risk using available market information and valuation methodologies. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. The variable-cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the swap, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using \"significant unobservable inputs\" such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe periodically utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in fuel prices and interest rates. At inception of a derivative contract, we document relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various derivative transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness. We record derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability at fair value. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion is recorded in other income or expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards adopted\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2015-03, and in August 2015, issued ASU 2015-15. These ASUs require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt consistent with debt discounts. The presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit, may be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by these ASUs. These ASUs are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard for the fiscal year 2016.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid-in-capital pools. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance is effective in 2017 with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard effective for the fiscal year 2016 resulting in the recording of $2.2 million to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2016, and $1.1 million of additional income tax benefit in 2016 as a result of previously unrecognized tax benefits resulting from our net operating loss carryovers. The statement of cash flows has not been adjusted for prior periods, as we have adopted the statement of cash flow guidance prospectively.\nAccounting Standards not yet adopted\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The new standard introduces a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The premise of the new model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will be effective for the Company for its annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect. We are in the process of evaluating the new standard, but we believe our revenue recognized under the new standard will generally approximate revenue under current standards and, while we expect an impact to both revenue and certain variable expenses as a result of the adoption, we expect that the net impact to equity or earnings on a prospective basis will not be material. We plan to complete our evaluation in 2017, including an assessment of the new expanded disclosure requirements and a final determination of the transition method we will use to adopt the new standard.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease obligation for all leases. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize an asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lessor accounting under the new standard is substantially unchanged. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required. This new standard will become effective for us in our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period and requires a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently evaluating the impacts the adoption of this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nINFLATION, NEW EMISSIONS CONTROL REGULATIONS, AND FUEL COSTS\nMost of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations. During the past five years, the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the related depreciation, health care, and driver and non-driver wages. New emissions control regulations and increases in wages of manufacturing workers and other items have resulted in higher tractor prices, while the decline in the market value of used equipment significantly reduced the residual values of units in fiscal 2015 and 2016. The cost of fuel has been extremely volatile over the last several years, with costs decreasing significantly in both 2016 and 2015 after trending upward in 2010 through 2014. We believe at least some of this volatility reflects the fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and global demand for petroleum products, unrest in certain oil-producing countries, improved fuel efficiency due to technological advancements, and an increase in domestic supply. Health care prices have increased faster than general inflation, primarily due to the rapid increase in prescription drug costs and more people on our health plan in order to comply with the individual healthcare mandate. The nationwide shortage of qualified drivers has caused us to raise driver wages per mile at a rate faster than general inflation for the past four years, and this trend may continue as additional government regulations constrain industry capacity. Additionally, competition and the related cost to employ non-drivers have increased, especially for the more skilled or technical positions, including mechanics, those with information technology related skills, and degreed professionals.\nSEASONALITY\nOver the past three years, we have experienced marked surges in business and profitability during the fourth quarter holiday season, due to our team drivers and customer base. After this surge, revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments following the holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather, creating more physical damage equipment repairs. For the reasons stated, first quarter results historically have been lower than results in each of the other three quarters of the year, excluding charges. In recent years, we have seen the duration of the fourth quarter holiday \"peak\" season become compressed as consumers have come to expect shorter and shorter shipping times and our customers' networks have adjusted accordingly. If this trend continues, our ability to take advantage of this surge in business and our fourth quarter profitability could be negatively affected.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nItem 7, as well as other items of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such statements are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

Our operating ratio declined 460 basis points to 95.2%. Our adjusted operating ratio (as defined below), a key measure of profitability in our industry, contracted 530 basis points to a 94.7%. These declines were the result of overall softness in freight within the Truckload segment, resulting in a slight decline in miles per tractor per week and a 3.9% decrease in the average tractor count, even considering a 5.3% increase in the number of team tractors, and average rates per total mile declining 2.2 cents per mile. Cost in the Truckload segment increased 8.3 cents per mile, primarily as a result of increased capital cost, resulting from the significant decline in used equipment values and related increase in depreciation. On the contrary, our non-Truckload operations experienced growth in both revenue and profitability as we were able to take advantage of the market dynamics and realize the full year effect of several business model changes and new customers added in 2015. Our consolidated financial results are summarized as follows:\n \u25cf Total revenue was $670.7 million, compared with $724.2 million for 2015, and freight revenue (excludes revenue from fuel surcharge) was $610.8 million, compared with $640.1 million for 2015; \u25cf Operating income was $32.4 million, compared with operating income of $67.8 million for 2015; \n \u25cf Net income was $16.8 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared with net income of $42.1 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, for 2015. Net income for 2015 includes a one-time federal income tax credit of approximately $4.7 million, or $0.26 per diluted share and an insurance policy commutation credit of approximately $2.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share; \u25cf Our equity investment in TEL provided $3.0 million of pre-tax earnings in 2016 compared to $4.6 million for 2015; and \u25cf Stockholders' equity and tangible book value at December 31, 2016, were $236.4 million, or $12.95 per basic share. \nAlthough 2016 was not what we had hoped, we are still encouraged by the trend line over the last several years. Our turnaround efforts at SRT were fully engaged in 2016, including a new management team, and we have established a roadmap that we believe will be successful in returning SRT's results to levels where they produce an acceptable return. We continue to focus on deleveraging the balance sheet resulting in total indebtedness, net of cash and including the present value of off-balance sheet lease obligations decreasing by approximately $37.5 million to $226.7 million, since December 31, 2015. Additionally, earnings and the reduced impact of fuel hedges have increased tangible book value per basic share 16.1% to $12.95 from $11.15 at December 31, 2015.\nIn addition to operating ratio, we use \"adjusted operating ratio\" as a key measure of profitability. Adjusted operating ratio is not a substitute for operating ratio measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted operating ratio means operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge revenue, expressed as a percentage of revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue. We believe the use of adjusted operating ratio allows us to more effectively compare periods, while excluding the potentially volatile effect of changes in fuel prices. Our Board and management focus on our adjusted operating ratio as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of adjusted operating ratio is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that adjusted operating ratio improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define adjusted operating ratio differently. Because of these limitations, adjusted operating ratio should not be considered a measure of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nOperating Ratio\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> Operating Ratio ( OR\u201d) From 2014 to 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP Operating Ratio:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 670,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 718,980\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 638,204\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 95.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 656,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 90.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 679,334\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 94.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,646\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Operating Ratio:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Adj.

In the first half of 2017 we do not expect to match the earnings per share levels we generated for the first and second quarters of 2016. However, we believe the combination of an improving economy, growth of time-sensitive e-commerce freight, industry regulatory changes, retail inventory declines, year-over-year net fuel expense savings from our improved fuel hedge positions, and operational progress at SRT should deliver earnings improvement that result in higher earnings for the second half and potentially the full year of 2017. The largest variable we foresee is the pace and magnitude of improvement at SRT, which we believe could contribute up to $10.0 million of pre-tax income in improved results as compared with 2016. The pace and amount of change will depend, in large part, on our ability to enhance the freight network, which depends on internally re-engineering lanes and a stronger refrigerated freight market. With net capital expenditures scheduled to be below normal due to the timing of our expected replacement cycle, along with anticipated positive operating cash flows, we expect to further reduce balance sheet and off-balance sheet debt over the course of fiscal 2017. Our 2017 plans also include growing our dedicated service line and investing in personnel and trailer tracking equipment that will allow more cross-border freight opportunities.\nRESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) for the periods indicated:\nRevenue\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 610,845\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 640,120\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 578,204\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel surcharge revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 59,806\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 84,120\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 140,776\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 670,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 718,980\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, total revenue decreased $53.6 million, or 7.4%, to $670.7 million from $724.2 million in 2015. Freight revenue decreased $29.3 million, or 4.6%, to $610.8 million for 2016, from $640.1 million in 2015, while fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million year-over-year. The decrease in freight revenue resulted from a $30.4 million decrease in freight revenue from our Truckload segment and a $1.1 million increase in revenues from Solutions.\nThe decrease in 2016 Truckload revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2015 and a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 from approximately 950 teams in 2015.\nThe increase in Solutions' revenue is primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\nFor 2015, total revenue increased $5.3 million, or 0.7%, to $724.2 million from $719.0 million in 2014. Freight revenue increased $61.9 million, or 10.7%, to $640.1 million for 2015, from $578.2 million in 2014, while fuel surcharge revenue decreased $56.7 million year-over-year. The increase in freight revenue resulted from a $49.6 million increase in freight revenue from our Truckload segment and a $12.3 million increase in revenues from Solutions.\nThe increase in 2015 Truckload revenue relates to an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 5.0% compared to 2014 and a $4.6 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as an increase in our average tractor fleet of 3.5% from 2014. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 5.7% increase, or 9.1 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2014. Team driven units increased approximately 13.6% to an average of approximately 950 teams in 2015 from approximately 840 teams in 2014.\nThe increase in Solutions' revenue is primarily the result of additional peak-season freight opportunities during the fourth quarter of 2015, improved coordination with our Truckload segment, and additional business from new customers added during the year.\nIf capacity tightens as a result of regulations impacting the industry or economic growth, we expect the pricing environment to improve in the latter half of 2017 and into 2018 and 2019, offset in part by higher driver pay and other inflationary costs.\nFor comparison purposes in the discussion below, we use total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue. As it relates to the comparison of expenses to freight revenue, we believe removing fuel surcharge revenue, which is sometimes a volatile source of revenue, affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period-to-period. Nonetheless, freight revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not a substitute for revenue measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Our Board and management focus on our freight revenue as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of freight revenue is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that freight revenue improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define freight revenue differently. Because of these limitations, freight revenue should not be considered a measure of total revenue generated by or available to our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries, wages, and related expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 234,526\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 244,779\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,761\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses decreased approximately $10.3 million, or 4.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased to 35.0% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 33.8% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased slightly to 38.4% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 38.2% in 2015. Salaries, wages, and related expenses decreased significantly on an overall dollar basis as a result of a 3.9% decrease in average tractors, but were relatively flat as a percentage of freight revenue, primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2015, partially offset by a decrease in non-driver incentive compensation as a result of reduced profitability in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally, group insurance costs decreased approximately $2.3 million from 2015 as a result of better claims experience.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses increased approximately $13.0 million, or 5.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased to 33.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 32.2% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses declined to 38.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 40.1% in 2014. Salaries, wages, and related expenses increased approximately 2.1 cents per mile primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2014, as well as increased non-driver incentive compensation tied to our results of operations. Additionally, group insurance costs increased approximately $0.9 million from 2014 as a result of more participants and fees directly related to the Affordable Care Act and we had additional costs of approximately $1.0 million due to an increase in non-driver headcount as a result of the increased average number of units. These increases were partially offset by lower workers' compensation expense in 2015 at 1.7 cents per company mile compared to 3.4 cents in 2014 due to fewer claims with less severity. Additionally, we had an increase in the percentage of our fleet comprised of independent contractors, whose costs are included in the purchased transportation line item.\nGoing forward, we believe salaries, wages, and related expenses will increase as a result of a tight driver market, wage inflation, higher healthcare costs, and, in certain periods, increased incentive compensation due to better performance. In particular, we expect driver pay to increase as we look to reduce the number of unseated tractors in our fleet in a tight market for drivers. Additionally, when the freight market allows for an increase in rates we would expect to, as we have historically, pass a portion of those rate increases on to our professional drivers. Salaries, wages, and related expenses will fluctuate to some extent based on the percentage of revenue generated by independent contractors and our Solutions business, for which payments are reflected in the purchased transportation line item.\nFuel expense\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,108\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,160\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 168,856\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe receive a fuel surcharge on our loaded miles from most shippers; however, this does not cover the entire increase in fuel prices for several reasons, including the following: surcharges cover only loaded miles we operate; surcharges do not cover miles driven out-of-route by our drivers; and surcharges typically do not cover refrigeration unit fuel usage or fuel burned by tractors while idling. Moreover, most of our business relating to shipments obtained from freight brokers does not carry a fuel surcharge. Finally, fuel surcharges vary in the percentage of reimbursement offered, and not all surcharges fully compensate for fuel price increases even on loaded miles.\nThe rate of fuel price changes also can have an impact on results. Most fuel surcharges are based on the average fuel price as published by the DOE for the week prior to the shipment, meaning we typically bill customers in the current week based on the previous week's applicable index. Therefore, in times of increasing fuel prices, we do not recover as much as we are currently paying for fuel. In periods of declining prices, the opposite is true. Fuel prices as measured by the DOE averaged approximately $0.40 cents per gallon lower in 2016 compared with 2015 and $1.12 per gallon lower in 2015 compared to 2014.\nAdditionally, $16.7 million, $15.3 million, and $3.1 million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to our results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, as additional fuel expense for 2016, 2015 and 2014, related to losses on fuel hedge contracts that expired. We evaluate these contracts for \"hedge effectiveness,\" which is the extent to which the hedge contract effectively offsets changes in cash flows that the contract was intended to offset. In addition to the amounts reclassified as a result of expired contracts, we recognized a reduction of fuel expense of $1.4 million relating to previously recognized fuel expense as a result of the expiration of the fuel hedge contracts for which the fuel hedging relationship was deemed to be ineffective on a prospective basis in 2014. As a result, the changes in fair value for those contracts were recorded as expense rather than as a component of other comprehensive loss. At December 31, 2016, all fuel hedge contracts were deemed to be effective and thus continue to qualify as cash flow hedges. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded on the contracts that existed at December 31, 2016. The ineffectiveness was calculated using the cumulative dollar offset method as an estimate of the difference in the expected cash flows of the respective fuel hedge contracts compared to the changes in the all-in cash outflows required for the diesel fuel purchases.\nTo measure the effectiveness of our fuel surcharge program, we subtract fuel surcharge revenue (other than the fuel surcharge revenue we reimburse to independent contractors and other third parties, which is included in purchased transportation) from our fuel expense. The result is referred to as net fuel expense. Our net fuel expense as a percentage of freight revenue is affected by the cost of diesel fuel net of fuel surcharge collection, the percentage of miles driven by company tractors, our fuel economy, and our percentage of deadhead miles, for which we do not receive material fuel surcharge revenues. Net fuel expense is shown below:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fuel surcharge\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,806\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,120\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140,776\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Fuel surcharge revenue reimbursed to independent contractors and other third parties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,250\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,790\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,837\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Company fuel surcharge revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,556\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,330\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,939\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fuel expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,108\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,160\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 168,856\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Company fuel surcharge revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 53,556\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 76,330\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 129,939\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net fuel expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,552\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,830\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,917\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal fuel expense decreased approximately $19.1 million, or 15.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015.

As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.9% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 19.1% in 2015. These decreases primarily related to lower fuel prices and an increase in our average fuel miles per gallon during 2016 as a result of purchasing equipment with more fuel-efficient engines. The decreases were partially offset by increased net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $16.7 million in 2016 compared to $13.9 million in 2015.\nNet fuel expense increased $3.7 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense increased 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. These increases primarily resulted from lower fuel surcharge recovery as a result of increased broker freight and the tiered reimbursement structure of certain fuel surcharge agreements. The increases were partially offset by improved miles per gallon due to new engine technology, internal fuel efficiency initiatives, and a greater percentage of miles driven by independent contractors.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, total fuel expense decreased approximately $46.7 million, or 27.7%, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.9% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 23.5% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 19.1% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 29.2% in 2014. These decreases primarily related to an increase in our average fuel miles per gallon during 2015 as a result of purchasing equipment with more fuel-efficient engines. The decreases were partially offset by net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $13.9 million in 2015 compared to $3.1 million in 2014. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2014 we recognized an approximately $0.9 million fuel tax credit related to amended fuel tax returns for the years 2010 - 2013.\nNet fuel expense increased $6.9 million, or 17.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense increased 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. These increases primarily resulted from lower fuel surcharge recovery. The increases were partially offset by improved miles per gallon due to new engine technology, internal fuel efficiency initiatives, a greater percentage of miles driven by independent contractors, and an approximately $0.9 million fuel tax credit taken during the second quarter of 2014 related to amended fuel tax returns for the years 2010 - 2013.\nWe expect to continue managing our idle time and tractor speeds, investing in more fuel-efficient tractors to improve our miles per gallon, locking in fuel hedges when deemed appropriate, and partnering with customers to adjust fuel surcharge programs that are inadequate to recover a fair portion of fuel costs. Going forward, our net fuel expense is expected to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue based on factors such as diesel fuel prices, percentage recovered from fuel surcharge programs, percentage of uncompensated miles, percentage of revenue generated by team-driven tractors (which tend to generate higher miles and lower revenue per mile, thus proportionately more fuel cost as a percentage of revenue), percentage of revenue generated by refrigerated operation (which uses diesel fuel for refrigeration, but usually does not recover fuel surcharges on refrigeration fuel), percentage of revenue generated from independent contractors, the success of fuel efficiency initiatives, and gains and losses on fuel hedging contracts.\nGiven recent historical lows, we would expect diesel fuel prices to remain flat or increase over the next few years. However, due to hedging contracts being locked in at a lower rate on a portion of our expected gallons compared to 2016 and 2015, we expect net fuel cost to significantly decline in 2017 and 2018.\nOperations and maintenance\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operations and maintenance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,864\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,251\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperations and maintenance decreased $0.6 million, or 1.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015.

As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance increased to 7.5% of freight revenue for 2016, from 7.3% in 2015 due to an increase in unloading and other operational costs associated with our increase in dedicated freight, partially offset by lower maintenance cost on our revenue equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, operations and maintenance decreased $0.8 million, or 1.7%, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, operations and maintenance remained relatively even at 6.4% of total revenue in 2015, compared with 6.6% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance decreased to 7.3% of freight revenue for 2015, from 8.2% in 2014 due to a decrease in our average age of equipment partially offset by increased driver recruiting costs.\nGoing forward, we believe this category will fluctuate based on several factors, including our continued ability to maintain a relatively young fleet, accident severity and frequency, weather, and the reliability of new and untested revenue equipment models.\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,472\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,583\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 111,772\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased approximately $1.1 million, or 0.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 17.5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 16.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 19.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 18.5% in 2015. These changes were primarily the result of a $0.7 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers related to increased revenues at our Solutions subsidiary and growth of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in leased equipment rental payments due to a reduction in our trailers under operating leases from 2,239 at December 31, 2105 to 1,695 at December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased approximately $6.8 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 16.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 15.5% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased to 18.5% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 19.3% in 2014. These changes were primarily the result of a $14.4 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers related to increased revenues at our Solutions subsidiary, growth of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering and an increase in payments to independent contractors, which comprised a larger percentage of our total fleet. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in leased equipment rental payments and by lower fuel surcharge pass-through payments to independent contractors and third party carriers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, miles run by independent contractors increased to 9.0% of our total miles from 8.2% for 2014, and tractors under operating leases decreased to 115 units from 150 units in 2014. We expect revenue equipment rentals to decrease going forward as a result of our increase in acquisition of revenue equipment through financed purchases or capital leases rather than operating leases. As discussed below, this decrease may be partially or fully offset by an increase in purchased transportation as we expect to continue to grow our Solutions and intermodal service offerings.\nWe expect purchased transportation to increase as we seek to grow our Solutions subsidiary and if fuel prices continue to increase, which would result in an increase in what we pay third party carriers and independent contractors. However, this expense category will fluctuate with the number and percentage of loads hauled by independent contractors, loads handled by Solutions, and tractors, trailers, and other assets financed with operating leases. In addition, factors such as the cost to obtain third party transportation services, and growth of our intermodal service offerings, and the amount of fuel surcharge revenue passed through to the third party carriers and independent contractors will affect this expense category. If industry-wide trucking capacity were to tighten in relation to freight demand, we may need to increase the amounts we pay to third-party transportation providers, independent contractors, and intermodal transportation providers, which could increase this expense category on an absolute basis and as a percentage of freight revenue absent an offsetting increase in revenue. We continue to actively recruit independent contractors and, if we are successful, we would expect this line item to increase as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating taxes and licenses\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating taxes and licenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,712\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,960\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the periods presented, the change in operating taxes and licenses was not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nInsurance and claims\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance and claims\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,596\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,909\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,594\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInsurance and claims, consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability, physical damage, and cargo damage insurance and claims, increased approximately $0.7 million, or 2.2%, for year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, insurance and claims increased to 4.9% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 4.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims increased to 5.3% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 5.0% in 2015. These increases are primarily related to the non-recurring $3.6 million benefit in the second quarter of 2015 from commutation of our auto liability policy for the period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014. These increases also resulted from increased accident severity, resulting in total insurance cost increasing to 10.3 cents per mile for 2016 from 9.6 cents per mile in 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreased accident rates in 2016, as measured by a 6.8% improvement in DOT reportable accidents per million miles driven at 0.82% - the second lowest in the last ten years.\nInsurance and claims decreased approximately $7.7 million, or 19.4%, for year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, insurance and claims decreased to 4.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 5.5% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims decreased to 5.0% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 6.8% in 2014. These decreases are primarily related to the difference between the approximately $7.5 million of additional reserves related to the adverse judgment in 2014 regarding a 2008 cargo claim compared with the $3.6 million benefit in the second quarter of 2015 from commutation of our auto liability policy for the period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014. Excluding the 2008 cargo claim, insurance and claims cost per mile decreased to 9.6 cents per mile in 2015 from 9.9 cents per mile in 2014.\nOur auto liability (personal injury and property damage), cargo, and general liability insurance programs include significant self-insured retention amounts. The auto liability policy contains a feature whereby we are able to retroactively obtain a partial refund of the premium in exchange for taking on the liability for incidents that occurred during the period and releasing the insurers. This is referred to as \"commuting\" the policy or \"policy commutation.\" In several past periods, including the policy period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014, we have commuted the policy, which has lowered our insurance and claims expense. We are also self-insured for physical damage to our equipment. Because of these significant self-insured exposures, insurance and claims expense may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period. Any increase in frequency or severity of claims, or any increases to then-existing reserves, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In relation to the 2008 cargo claim reserve, the judgment was partially reversed and the proceedings were remanded to the district court for further factual determinations. If these further proceedings are resolved favorably to us, any reduction of the accrual could reduce insurance and claims expense in the period in which the claim is resolved. On the other hand, if we are not successful in such a finding or mediation, insurance and claims expense may increase as a result of continuing litigation expenses, including pre and post judgment interest. We periodically evaluate strategies to efficiently reduce our insurance and claims expense, which in the past has included the commutation of our auto liability insurance policy. We intend to evaluate our ability to commute the current policy and any such commutation could significantly impact insurance and claims expense.\nCommunications and utilities\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Communications and utilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,057\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,162\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,806\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the periods presented, the changes in communications and utilities were not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nGeneral supplies and expenses\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General supplies and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,413\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,007\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,950\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, general supplies and expenses increased approximately $0.4 million, or 2.9%, compared with 2015.

Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $9.6 million in 2016 from 2015, primarily as a result of more owned equipment and a significant reduction on the value of used tractors resulting in a change to residual values. Losses on the disposal of property and equipment, totaled $0.8 million in 2016, compared to gains of $0.6 million in 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, depreciation and amortization increased $15.0 million, or 32.3%, compared with 2014.

As a percentage of freight revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 9.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 8.0% in 2014. Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $13.0 million in 2015 from 2014, primarily as a result of new equipment and an increase in owned tractors of approximately 500 due to a reduction in use of operating leases to finance revenue equipment. Gains on the disposal of property and equipment, totaling $0.6 million in 2015, were $2.0 million lower than 2014 due to the number, type, and mileage of the equipment sold. Additionally, depreciation increased and gains on the disposal of property and equipment decreased as a result of the softening of the used tractor market during the latter portion of the year.\nWe expect to see an increase in depreciation and amortization going forward, specifically as compared to the first and second quarters of 2016, as we continue to recognize the impact of the significant reductions in residual values, which should lessen on a comparative basis in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, if the used tractor market were to decline further, we could have to adjust residual values again and increase depreciation or experience increased losses on sale.\nInterest expense, net\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,226\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,445\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,794\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of freight revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net includes interest expense, interest income, and other miscellaneous non-operating items, which decreased approximately $0.2 million, or 2.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015.

These increases were primarily related to the $31.3 million increase in the pre-tax income in 2015 compared to 2014 resulting from the improvements in operating income noted above, a one-time federal income tax credit of approximately $4.7 million, and the increase in the contribution from TEL's earnings.\nThe effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due primarily to permanent differences related to our per diem pay structure for drivers. Due to the partial nondeductible effect of the per diem payments, our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates.\nRESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS\nWe have one reportable segment, truckload services, which we refer to as Truckload. In addition, our Solutions subsidiary has service offerings ancillary to our Truckload services, including: freight brokerage and logistics service directly and through freight brokerage agents who are paid a commission for the freight they provide and accounts receivable factoring. These operations consist of several operating segments, which neither individually nor in the aggregate meet the quantitative or qualitative reporting thresholds. As a result, these operations are grouped in \"Other.\" The operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\"Unallocated Corporate Overhead\" includes costs that are incidental to our activities and are not specifically allocated to one of the segments. The following table summarizes financial and operating data by segment:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Truckload\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 601,226\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 655,918\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 663,001\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 69,425\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 68,322\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 55,979\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 670,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 718,980\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income (loss):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Truckload\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,031\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,107\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,151\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,631\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,768\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,894\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated Corporate Overhead\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12,215\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12,093\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (18,399\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,646\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nOur Truckload revenue decreased $54.7 million, as freight revenue decreased $30.4 million and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million. The decrease in freight revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2016, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Additionally, team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 compared to approximately 950 in 2015.\nOur Truckload operating income was $37.1 million less in 2016 than 2015 due to the abovementioned decrease in freight revenue. Additionally, operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, increased primarily due to increased salaries, wages, and related expenses (which was primarily due to a higher percentage of our fleet being comprised of team-driven tractors, as well as driver and non-driver employee pay increases since the same 2015 period), increased net fuel expense, and increased capital costs, partially offset by reduced workers' compensation expense and operations and maintenance expense.\nOther total revenue increased $1.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and operating income increased $1.9 million for the same period. These improvements are primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\nUnallocated corporate overhead remained relatively flat as a result of a $3.2 million reduction in incentive compensation in 2016, primarily as a result of decreased profitability, partially offset by the 2015 period including the $3.6 million in return of previously expensed insurance premiums for the commutation of our primary auto liability policy for the period of April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOur Truckload revenue decreased $7.1 million, as freight revenue increased $49.6 million and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $56.7 million. The increase in freight revenue relates to an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 5.0% compared to 2014 and a $4.6 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as an increase in our average tractor fleet of 3.5% from 2014. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 5.7% increase, or 9.1 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2014. Additionally, team driven units increased approximately 13.6% to an average of approximately 950 teams in 2015 compared to approximately 840 in 2014.\nOur Truckload operating income was $20.0 million higher in 2015 than 2014 due to the abovementioned increase in freight revenue. Additionally, operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, decreased primarily due to reduced workers' compensation expense and operations and maintenance expense partially offset by increased salaries, wages, and related expenses (which was primarily due to a higher percentage of our fleet being comprised of team-driven tractors, as well as driver and nondriver employee pay increases since the same 2014 period), increased net fuel expense, and increased capital costs.\nOther total revenue increased $12.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and operating income increased $1.9 million for the same period. These improvements are primarily the result of additional peak season freight opportunities during the fourth quarter of 2015, improved coordination with our Truckload segment, and additional business from new customers added during the year.\nThe reduction in unallocated corporate overhead primarily includes $3.6 million in return of previously expensed insurance premiums for the commutation of our primary auto liability policy for the period of April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014, and the $1.4 million reduction in fuel expense related to the ineffective fuel hedge contracts fulfilled in 2015 that were deemed to be ineffective on a prospective basis in 2014.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur business requires significant capital investments over the short-term and the long-term. Recently, we have financed our capital requirements with borrowings under our Credit Facility, cash flows from operations, long-term operating leases, capital leases, secured installment notes with finance companies, and proceeds from the sale of our used revenue equipment. We had working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) of $47.9 million and $46.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Based on our expected financial condition, net capital expenditures, results of operations, related net cash flows, installment notes, and other sources of financing, we believe our working capital and sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our current and projected needs and we do not expect to experience material liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $12.2 million of borrowings outstanding, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately $27.2 million, and available borrowing capacity of $55.6 million under the Credit Facility. Fluctuations in the outstanding balance and related availability under our Credit Facility are driven primarily by cash flows from operations and the timing and nature of property and equipment additions that are not funded through notes payable, as well as the nature and timing of collection of accounts receivable, payments of accrued expenses, and receipt of proceeds from disposals of property and equipment.\nWith an average tractor fleet age of 1.8 years, we believe we have flexibility to manage our fleet and we plan to regularly evaluate our tractor replacement cycle, new tractor purchase requirements, and financing options.\nCash Flows\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $102.4 million in 2016 compared with $85.5 million in 2015 primarily due to the change in receivables and advances as a result of increased cash collected during 2016 related to increased 2015 year-end revenues, and the fluctuation in tax benefit/expense due to the reversal of deferred tax effects on amounts in other comprehensive income. This improvement is partially offset by net income of $16.8 million in 2016 compared to net income of $42.1 million in 2015, depreciation and amortization increasing $9.6 million in 2016, primarily as the result of the reduced residual revenue equipment value projections due to the softened used equipment market and the 2015 purchase of our previously leased Chattanooga headquarters property, and the 2015 return of $5.0 million which was previously provided by us to certain of our derivative counterparties related to the net liability position of certain of our fuel derivative instruments. The fluctuations in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily related to the timing of payments on our accrued expenses and trade accounts in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.\nNet cash flows used by investing activities were $47.3 million in 2016 compared with $147.7 million in 2015. The $100.4 million decrease in net investing activities was attributable primarily to the purchase of our corporate headquarters property in Chattanooga, Tennessee during 2015 for approximately $35.5 million, as well as a $22.9 million decrease in assets held for sale due to the timing of dispositions of used revenue equipment. During 2017 we plan to take delivery of approximately 485 new company tractors and dispose of approximately 460 used tractors. This compares to the approximately 650 new company tractors we took delivery of and the approximately 1,074 used tractors we disposed of during 2016, including 365 recorded as assets held for sale at December 31, 2015. Going forward, cash flows from disposals of equipment could be more volatile given the weakness in the used tractor market.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $51.9 million in 2016, compared with net cash flows provided by financing activities of $45.4 million in 2015. The change in net cash flows used in financing activities was primarily a function of net repayments of notes payable and the balance under our Credit Facility. These changes primarily relate to the trade cycle of our revenue equipment, including the impact of deferring receipt of proceeds of 350 tractors held for sale that were under contract to be sold in the first quarter of 2016, and cash flows from investing and operating activities discussed above. Going forward, our cash flows may fluctuate depending on the resolution of the 2008 cargo claim, future stock repurchases, and the extent of future income tax obligations.\nMaterial Debt Agreements\nWe and substantially all of our subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Borrowers\") are parties to a Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the \"Credit Facility\") with Bank of America, N.A., as agent (the \"Agent\") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPM,\" and together with the Agent, the \"Lenders\").\nThe Credit Facility is a $95.0 million revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted accordion feature that, so long as no event of default exists, allows us to request an increase in the revolving credit facility of up to $50.0 million, subject to Lender acceptance of the additional funding commitment. The Credit Facility includes, within our $95.0 million revolving credit facility, a letter of credit sub facility in an aggregate amount of $95.0 million and a swing line sub facility in an aggregate amount equal to the greater of $10.0 million or 10% of the Lenders' aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility from time-to-time.\nIn 2015, we entered into an eleventh amendment to the Credit Facility, which, among other things, (i) amended the \"Applicable Margin\" to improve the interest rate grid, (ii) improved the unused line fee pricing to 0.25% per annum, retroactive to July 1, 2015 (previously the fee was 0.375% per annum when availability was less than $50.0 million and 0.5% per annum when availability was at or over such amount), (iii) required each of Driven Analytic Solutions, LLC (\"DAS\") and Covenant Properties, LLC (\"CPI\") to be joined to the Credit Agreement as guarantors, (iv) required each of DAS, CPI and Star Properties Exchange, LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company, to pledge certain of its assets as security, (v) contained conditional amendments increasing the borrowing base real estate sublimit and lowering the amortization of the real estate sublimit, (vi) made technical amendments to a variety of sections, including without limitation, permitted investments, permitted stock repurchases, permitted indebtedness, and permitted liens, (vii) consented to our purchase of our headquarters, including related financing, and (viii) extended the maturity date from September 2017 to September 2018. In exchange for these amendments, we agreed to pay fees of $0.2 million. In 2016, we entered into the twelfth and thirteenth amendments to the Credit Facility, which among other things (i) increases the approved amount for share repurchases to $45.0 million, subject to certain limitations based on the available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, and (ii) permitted the formation of Heritage Insurance, Inc., and substituted certain language to ensure the federal funds rate or LIBOR would not be less than zero.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as either \"base rate loans\" or \"LIBOR loans.\" Base rate loans accrue interest at a base rate equal to the greater of the Agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.0%; while LIBOR loans accrue interest at LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.0%. The applicable rates are adjusted quarterly based on average pricing availability. The unused line fee is the product of 0.25% times the average daily amount by which the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility exceed the outstanding principal amount of revolver loans and the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. The obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets, with the notable exclusion of any real estate or revenue equipment pledged under other financing agreements, including revenue equipment installment notes and capital leases.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base limited to the lesser of (A) $95.0 million, minus the sum of the stated amount of all outstanding letters of credit; or (B) the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) the lesser of (a) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible revenue equipment, (b) 95% of the net book value of eligible revenue equipment, or (c) 35% of the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility, plus (iii) the lesser of (a) $25.0 million or (b) 65% of the appraised fair market value of eligible real estate. We had $12.2 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately $27.2 million, and available borrowing capacity of $55.6 million. The interest rate on outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2016, was 2.3% on $9.0 million of base rate loans and 4.3% on $3.2 million of LIBOR loans. Based on availability as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no fixed charge coverage requirement.\nThe Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for a facility of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the Credit Facility may be accelerated, and the Lenders' commitments may be terminated. If an event of default occurs under the Credit Facility and the Lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Credit Facility to become due and payable, this could result in a default under other debt instruments that contain acceleration or cross-default provisions. The Credit Facility contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to, among other things, debt, dividends, liens, acquisitions and dispositions outside of the ordinary course of business, and affiliate transactions. Failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions set forth in the Credit Facility could result in an event of default.\nCapital lease obligations are utilized to finance a portion of our revenue equipment and are entered into with certain finance companies who are not parties to our Credit Facility. The leases in effect at December 31, 2016 terminate in January 2017 through December 2022 and contain guarantees of the residual value of the related equipment by us. As such, the residual guarantees are included in the related debt balance as a balloon payment at the end of the related term as well as included in the future minimum capital lease payments. These lease agreements require us to pay personal property taxes, maintenance, and operating expenses.\nPricing for the revenue equipment installment notes is quoted by the respective financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders at the funding of each group of equipment acquired and include fixed annual rates for new equipment under retail installment contracts. The notes included in the funding are due in monthly installments with final maturities at various dates ranging from January 2017 to January 2022. The notes contain certain requirements regarding payment, insuring of collateral, and other matters, but do not have any financial or other material covenants or events of default except certain notes totaling $166.1 million are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additionally, certain of our fuel hedge contracts totaling $3.6 million at December 31, 2016, are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additional borrowings from the financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders are expected to be available to fund new tractors expected to be delivered in 2017, while any other property and equipment purchases, including trailers, are expected to be funded with a combination of available cash, notes, operating leases, capital leases, and/or from the Credit Facility.\nIn August 2015, we financed a portion of the purchase of our corporate headquarters, a maintenance facility, and certain surrounding property in Chattanooga, Tennessee by entering into a $28.0 million variable rate note with a third party lender. Concurrently with entering into the note, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively fix the related interest rate to 4.2%. See Note 13 for further information about the interest rate swap.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> Payments due by period:\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(less than\n1 year)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(1-3 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(1-3 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3-5 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n(3-5 years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nMore than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue equipment and property installment notes, including interest (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 207,687\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,087\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,643\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,010\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,892\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,352\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,703\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,456\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,135\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,047\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,844\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,526\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,062\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,062\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,062\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,284\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,508\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,548\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease residual value guarantees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,968\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,961\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,007\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,549\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,549\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 340,186\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,713\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,923\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,606\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,860\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,251\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents principal and interest payments owed at December 31, 2016. The borrowings consist of installment notes with finance companies, with fixed borrowing amounts and fixed interest rates, except for a variable rate real estate note, for which the interest rate is effectively fixed through an interest rate swap. The table assumes these installment notes are held to maturity. Refer to Note 7, \"Debt\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (2) Represents future monthly rental payment obligations under operating leases for tractors, trailers, and terminal properties, and computer and office equipment. Substantially all lease agreements for revenue equipment have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. The tractor lease agreements generally stipulate maximum miles and provide for mileage penalties for excess miles. These leases generally run for a period of three to five years for tractors and five to seven years for trailers. Refer to Note 8, \"Leases\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (3) Represents principal and interest payments owed at December 31, 2016. The borrowings consist of capital leases with one finance company, with fixed borrowing amounts and fixed interest rates. Borrowings in 2017 and thereafter include the residual value guarantees on the related equipment as balloon payments. Refer to Note 7, \"Debt\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (4) Represents purchase obligations for revenue equipment totaling approximately $86.5 million in 2016. These commitments are cancelable, subject to certain adjustments in the underlying obligations and benefits. These purchase commitments are expected to be financed by operating leases, capital leases, long-term debt, proceeds from sales of existing equipment, and/or cash flows from operations. Refer to Notes 7 and 8, \"Debt\" and \"Leases,\" respectively, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (5) Excludes any amounts accrued for unrecognized tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of such unrecognized tax benefits. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOperating leases are an important source of financing for our revenue equipment and certain real estate. At December 31, 2016, we had financed 135 tractors and 1,695 trailers under operating leases. Vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our consolidated balance sheets, and lease payments, in respect of such vehicles, are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the line item \"Revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation.\" Our revenue equipment rental expense was $10.6 million in 2016, compared with $12.4 million in 2015. The total value of remaining payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2016, was approximately $17.5 million. In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. The residual guarantees expire between August 2018 and February 2019 and had an undiscounted value of approximately $4.0 million at December 31, 2016. The discounted present value of the total remaining lease payments and residual value guarantees were approximately $18.7 million at December 31, 2016. We expect our residual guarantees to approximate the market value at the end of the lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make decisions based upon estimates, assumptions, and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances. Such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application, the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures. Changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those anticipated. A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the consolidated financial statements attached hereto. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue, drivers' wages, and other direct operating expenses generated by our Truckload reportable segment are recognized on the date shipments are delivered to the customer. Revenue includes transportation revenue, fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention, and other accessorial services.\nRevenue generated by our Solutions subsidiary is recognized upon completion of the services provided. Revenue is recorded on a gross basis, without deducting third party purchased transportation costs, as we act as a principal with substantial risks as primary obligor, except for transactions whereby equipment from our Truckload segment perform the related services, which we record on a net basis in accordance with the related authoritative guidance. Solutions revenue includes $2.6 million, $2.4 million, and $2.3 million of revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, related to an accounts receivable factoring business. Revenue for this business is recognized on a net basis, given we are acting as an agent and are not the primary obligor in these transactions.\nDepreciation of Revenue Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for book purposes is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, while depreciation for tax purposes is generally recorded using an accelerated method. Depreciation of revenue equipment is our largest item of depreciation. We generally depreciate new tractors (excluding day cabs) over five years to salvage values of approximately 15% of their cost and new trailers over seven years for refrigerated trailers and ten years for dry van trailers to salvage values of approximately 25% of their cost. We annually review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long-lived assets based upon, among other things, our experience with similar assets, conditions in the used revenue equipment market, and prevailing industry practice. Over the past several years, the price of new tractors has risen dramatically and there has been significant volatility in the used equipment market. As a result of the progressive decline in the market value of used tractors and our expectations that used tractor prices will not rebound in the near term, effective July 1, 2016 we reduced the salvage values on our tractors and, thus, prospectively increased depreciation expense. Estimates around the salvage values and useful lives for trailers remain unchanged. The impact in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 is approximately $2.0 million of additional depreciation expense per quarter or approximately $1.2 million per quarter net of tax, which represents approximately $0.06 per common or diluted share. Based on the prospective nature of this change, we expect depreciation and expense, including gains and losses, to approximate those levels of the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Changes in the useful life or salvage value estimates, or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates, could have a material effect on our results of operations. Gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn 2016 we had a net loss on revenue equipment of $0.8 million, and in 2015 and 2014 we generated net gains on revenue equipment, including assets held for sale, of $0.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively. We review salvage values of our revenue equipment annually and make adjustments periodically, based on trends in the used equipment market, to reflect updated estimates of fair value at disposal.\nWe lease certain revenue equipment under capital leases with terms of approximately 60 to 84 months. Amortization of leased assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense.\nPursuant to applicable accounting standards, revenue equipment and other long-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates impairment may exist. Expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred. If the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long-lived asset, then an impairment loss is recognized. We measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised value of the assets, as appropriate.\nAlthough a portion of our tractors are protected by non-binding indicative trade-in values or binding trade-back agreements with the manufacturers, some tractors and substantially all of our owned trailers continue to be subject to fluctuations in market prices for used revenue equipment. Moreover, our trade-back agreements are contingent upon reaching acceptable terms for the purchase of new equipment. Further declines in the price of used revenue equipment or failure to reach agreement for the purchase of new tractors with the manufacturers issuing trade-back agreements could result in impairment of, or losses on the sale of, revenue equipment. Historically, only a de minimus percentage of our equipment has been sold back to the dealers pursuant to the trade back agreements as we have generally found that market prices exceeded the trade back allowances, although in recent years, trade back allowances have increased as a result of the increasing cost of the underlying equipment.\nAssets Held For Sale\nAssets held for sale include property and revenue equipment no longer utilized in continuing operations which are available and held for sale. Assets held for sale are no longer subject to depreciation, and are recorded at the lower of depreciated book value or fair market value less selling costs. We periodically review the carrying value of these assets for possible impairment. We expect to sell these assets within twelve months.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe classify intangible assets into two categories: (i) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization and (ii) goodwill. We have no goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We test intangible assets with definite lives for impairment if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. We record an impairment charge when the carrying value of the definite lived intangible asset is not recoverable by the cash flows generated from the use of the asset.\nWe determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement, the history of the asset, our long-term strategy for the use of the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, generally on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, ranging from 4 to 20 years. We have no identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016, and $0.2 million at December 31, 2015, which was recorded in other assets.\nInsurance and Other Claims\nThe primary claims arising against us consist of auto liability (personal injury and property damage), workers' compensation, cargo, commercial liability, and employee medical expenses. Our insurance program involves self-insurance with the following risk retention levels (before giving effect to any commutation of an auto liability policy):\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> auto liability - $1.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> workers' compensation - $1.3 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> cargo - $0.3 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> employee medical - $0.4 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> physical damage - 100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to our significant self-insured retention amounts, we have exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims and to variations between our estimated and actual ultimate payouts. We accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims and an estimate for allocated loss adjustment expenses including legal and other direct costs associated with a claim. Estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, the size of any potential damage award based on factors such as the specific facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, the prospect of punitive damages, future medical costs, and inflation estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. We have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to estimates within our self-insured retention layers, we also must make judgments concerning claims where we have third party insurance and for claims outside our coverage limits. Upon settling claims and expenses associated with claims where we have third party coverage, we are generally required to initially fund payment to the claimant and seek reimbursement from the insurer. Receivables from insurers for claims and expenses we have paid on behalf of insurers were $0.7 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in drivers' advances and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we accrue claims above our self-insured retention and record a corresponding receivable for amounts we expect to collect from insurers upon settlement of such claims. We have less than $0.1 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a receivable in other assets and as a corresponding accrual in the long-term portion of insurance and claims accruals on our consolidated balance sheet for claims above our self-insured retention for which we believe it is reasonably assured that the insurers will provide their portion of such claims. We evaluate collectability of the receivables based on the credit worthiness and surplus of the insurers, along with our prior experience and contractual terms with each. If any claim occurrence were to exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. If one or more claims were to exceed our then effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also make judgments regarding the ultimate benefit versus risk to commuting certain periods within our auto liability policy. If we commute a policy, we assume 100% risk for covered claims in exchange for a policy refund. In April 2015, we commuted two liability policies for the period from April 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014, such that we are now responsible for any claim that occurred during that period up to $20.0 million, should such a claim develop. We recorded a $3.6 million reduction in insurance and claims expense in the second quarter of 2015 related to the commutation. The insurer did not remit the premium refund directly to the Company, but rather applied a credit to the current auto liability insurance policy, such that we recorded the policy release premium refund as a prepaid asset at June 30, 2015.\nEffective April 2015, we entered into new auto liability policies with a three-year term. As a result of the commutation and the Company's improved safety statistics over the prior policy, the Company received favorable premium pricing for the policy period, which we expect will reduce the fixed portion of insurance expense during such period. The policy includes a limit for a single loss of $9.0 million, an aggregate of $18.0 million for each policy year, and a $30.0 million aggregate for the three-year period ended March 31, 2018. The policy includes a policy release premium refund of up to $13.6 million, less any future amounts paid on claims by the insurer, from October 1, 2014 through March 31, 2018, if we were to commute the policy for the entire three years. A decision with respect to commutation of the policy cannot be made before April 1, 2018, unless both we and the insurance carrier agree to a commutation prior to the end of the policy term. Management cannot predict whether or not future claims or the development of existing claims will justify a commutation, and accordingly, no related amounts were recorded at December 31, 2016.\nIf claims development factors that are based upon historical experience change by 10%, our claims accrual as of December 31, 2016, would change by approximately $1.1 million.\nLease Accounting and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\nWe issue residual value guarantees in connection with the operating leases we enter into for certain of our revenue equipment. These leases provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. To the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee, we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases. The estimated values at lease termination involve management judgments. As leases are entered into, determination as to the classification as an operating or capital lease involves management judgments on residual values and useful lives.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We believe the future tax deductions will be realized principally through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, except for when a valuation allowance has been provided.\nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nStock-Based Employee Compensation\nWe issue several types of stock-based compensation, including awards that vest based on service and performance conditions or a combination of the conditions. Performance-based awards vest contingent upon meeting certain performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee. All awards require future service and thus forfeitures are estimated based on historical forfeitures and the remaining term until the related award vests. For performance-based awards, determining the appropriate amount to expense in each period is based on likelihood and timing of achieving the stated targets and requires judgment, including forecasting future financial results. The estimates are revised periodically based on the probability and timing of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate. Awards that are only subject to time vesting provisions are amortized using the straight-line method.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, commodity contracts, accounts payable, debt, and interest rate swaps. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current debt approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the factored receivables approximates the fair value, as the receivables are generally repaid directly to us by the client's customer within 30-40 days due to the combination of the short-term nature of the financing transaction and the underlying quality of the receivables. Interest rates that are currently available to us for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of our long-term debt, which primarily consists of revenue equipment installment notes. The fair value of our revenue equipment installment notes approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2016, as the weighted average interest rate on these notes approximates the market rate for similar debt. Borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility approximate fair value due to the variable interest rate on the facility. Additionally, commodity contracts, which are accounted for as hedge derivatives, as discussed in Note 13, are valued based on the forward rate of the specific indices upon which the contract is being settled and adjusted for counterparty credit risk using available market information and valuation methodologies. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. The variable-cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the swap, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using \"significant unobservable inputs\" such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe periodically utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in fuel prices and interest rates. At inception of a derivative contract, we document relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various derivative transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness. We record derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability at fair value. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion is recorded in other income or expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards adopted\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2015-03, and in August 2015, issued ASU 2015-15. These ASUs require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt consistent with debt discounts. The presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit, may be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by these ASUs. These ASUs are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard for the fiscal year 2016.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid-in-capital pools. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance is effective in 2017 with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard effective for the fiscal year 2016 resulting in the recording of $2.2 million to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2016, and $1.1 million of additional income tax benefit in 2016 as a result of previously unrecognized tax benefits resulting from our net operating loss carryovers. The statement of cash flows has not been adjusted for prior periods, as we have adopted the statement of cash flow guidance prospectively.\nAccounting Standards not yet adopted\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The new standard introduces a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The premise of the new model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will be effective for the Company for its annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect. We are in the process of evaluating the new standard, but we believe our revenue recognized under the new standard will generally approximate revenue under current standards and, while we expect an impact to both revenue and certain variable expenses as a result of the adoption, we expect that the net impact to equity or earnings on a prospective basis will not be material. We plan to complete our evaluation in 2017, including an assessment of the new expanded disclosure requirements and a final determination of the transition method we will use to adopt the new standard.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease obligation for all leases. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize an asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lessor accounting under the new standard is substantially unchanged. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required. This new standard will become effective for us in our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period and requires a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently evaluating the impacts the adoption of this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nINFLATION, NEW EMISSIONS CONTROL REGULATIONS, AND FUEL COSTS\nMost of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations. During the past five years, the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the related depreciation, health care, and driver and non-driver wages. New emissions control regulations and increases in wages of manufacturing workers and other items have resulted in higher tractor prices, while the decline in the market value of used equipment significantly reduced the residual values of units in fiscal 2015 and 2016. The cost of fuel has been extremely volatile over the last several years, with costs decreasing significantly in both 2016 and 2015 after trending upward in 2010 through 2014. We believe at least some of this volatility reflects the fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and global demand for petroleum products, unrest in certain oil-producing countries, improved fuel efficiency due to technological advancements, and an increase in domestic supply. Health care prices have increased faster than general inflation, primarily due to the rapid increase in prescription drug costs and more people on our health plan in order to comply with the individual healthcare mandate. The nationwide shortage of qualified drivers has caused us to raise driver wages per mile at a rate faster than general inflation for the past four years, and this trend may continue as additional government regulations constrain industry capacity. Additionally, competition and the related cost to employ non-drivers have increased, especially for the more skilled or technical positions, including mechanics, those with information technology related skills, and degreed professionals.\nSEASONALITY\nOver the past three years, we have experienced marked surges in business and profitability during the fourth quarter holiday season, due to our team drivers and customer base. After this surge, revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments following the holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather, creating more physical damage equipment repairs. For the reasons stated, first quarter results historically have been lower than results in each of the other three quarters of the year, excluding charges. In recent years, we have seen the duration of the fourth quarter holiday \"peak\" season become compressed as consumers have come to expect shorter and shorter shipping times and our customers' networks have adjusted accordingly. If this trend continues, our ability to take advantage of this surge in business and our fourth quarter profitability could be negatively affected.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.

Our operating ratio declined 460 basis points to 95.2%. Our adjusted operating ratio (as defined below), a key measure of profitability in our industry, contracted 530 basis points to a 94.7%. These declines were the result of overall softness in freight within the Truckload segment, resulting in a slight decline in miles per tractor per week and a 3.9% decrease in the average tractor count, even considering a 5.3% increase in the number of team tractors, and average rates per total mile declining 2.2 cents per mile. Cost in the Truckload segment increased 8.3 cents per mile, primarily as a result of increased capital cost, resulting from the significant decline in used equipment values and related increase in depreciation. On the contrary, our non-Truckload operations experienced growth in both revenue and profitability as we were able to take advantage of the market dynamics and realize the full year effect of several business model changes and new customers added in 2015. Our consolidated financial results are summarized as follows:\n \u25cf Total revenue was $670.7 million, compared with $724.2 million for 2015, and freight revenue (excludes revenue from fuel surcharge) was $610.8 million, compared with $640.1 million for 2015; \u25cf Operating income was $32.4 million, compared with operating income of $67.8 million for 2015; \n \u25cf Net income was $16.8 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared with net income of $42.1 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, for 2015. Net income for 2015 includes a one-time federal income tax credit of approximately $4.7 million, or $0.26 per diluted share and an insurance policy commutation credit of approximately $2.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share; \u25cf Our equity investment in TEL provided $3.0 million of pre-tax earnings in 2016 compared to $4.6 million for 2015; and \u25cf Stockholders' equity and tangible book value at December 31, 2016, were $236.4 million, or $12.95 per basic share. \nAlthough 2016 was not what we had hoped, we are still encouraged by the trend line over the last several years. Our turnaround efforts at SRT were fully engaged in 2016, including a new management team, and we have established a roadmap that we believe will be successful in returning SRT's results to levels where they produce an acceptable return. We continue to focus on deleveraging the balance sheet resulting in total indebtedness, net of cash and including the present value of off-balance sheet lease obligations decreasing by approximately $37.5 million to $226.7 million, since December 31, 2015. Additionally, earnings and the reduced impact of fuel hedges have increased tangible book value per basic share 16.1% to $12.95 from $11.15 at December 31, 2015.\nIn addition to operating ratio, we use \"adjusted operating ratio\" as a key measure of profitability. Adjusted operating ratio is not a substitute for operating ratio measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted operating ratio means operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge revenue, expressed as a percentage of revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue. We believe the use of adjusted operating ratio allows us to more effectively compare periods, while excluding the potentially volatile effect of changes in fuel prices. Our Board and management focus on our adjusted operating ratio as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of adjusted operating ratio is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that adjusted operating ratio improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define adjusted operating ratio differently. Because of these limitations, adjusted operating ratio should not be considered a measure of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nOperating Ratio\n\nOutlook\nWe are forecasting sequential improvement for 2017. In the first half of 2017 we do not expect to match the earnings per share levels we generated for the first and second quarters of 2016. However, we believe the combination of an improving economy, growth of time-sensitive e-commerce freight, industry regulatory changes, retail inventory declines, year-over-year net fuel expense savings from our improved fuel hedge positions, and operational progress at SRT should deliver earnings improvement that result in higher earnings for the second half and potentially the full year of 2017. The largest variable we foresee is the pace and magnitude of improvement at SRT, which we believe could contribute up to $10.0 million of pre-tax income in improved results as compared with 2016. The pace and amount of change will depend, in large part, on our ability to enhance the freight network, which depends on internally re-engineering lanes and a stronger refrigerated freight market. With net capital expenditures scheduled to be below normal due to the timing of our expected replacement cycle, along with anticipated positive operating cash flows, we expect to further reduce balance sheet and off-balance sheet debt over the course of fiscal 2017. Our 2017 plans also include growing our dedicated service line and investing in personnel and trailer tracking equipment that will allow more cross-border freight opportunities.\nRESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) for the periods indicated:\nRevenue\n\nFor 2016, total revenue decreased $53.6 million, or 7.4%, to $670.7 million from $724.2 million in 2015. Freight revenue decreased $29.3 million, or 4.6%, to $610.8 million for 2016, from $640.1 million in 2015, while fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million year-over-year. The decrease in freight revenue resulted from a $30.4 million decrease in freight revenue from our Truckload segment and a $1.1 million increase in revenues from Solutions.\nThe decrease in 2016 Truckload revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2015 and a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 from approximately 950 teams in 2015.\nThe increase in Solutions' revenue is primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\nFor 2015, total revenue increased $5.3 million, or 0.7%, to $724.2 million from $719.0 million in 2014. Freight revenue increased $61.9 million, or 10.7%, to $640.1 million for 2015, from $578.2 million in 2014, while fuel surcharge revenue decreased $56.7 million year-over-year. The increase in freight revenue resulted from a $49.6 million increase in freight revenue from our Truckload segment and a $12.3 million increase in revenues from Solutions.\nThe increase in 2015 Truckload revenue relates to an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 5.0% compared to 2014 and a $4.6 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as an increase in our average tractor fleet of 3.5% from 2014. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 5.7% increase, or 9.1 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2014. Team driven units increased approximately 13.6% to an average of approximately 950 teams in 2015 from approximately 840 teams in 2014.\nThe increase in Solutions' revenue is primarily the result of additional peak-season freight opportunities during the fourth quarter of 2015, improved coordination with our Truckload segment, and additional business from new customers added during the year.\nIf capacity tightens as a result of regulations impacting the industry or economic growth, we expect the pricing environment to improve in the latter half of 2017 and into 2018 and 2019, offset in part by higher driver pay and other inflationary costs.\nFor comparison purposes in the discussion below, we use total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue. As it relates to the comparison of expenses to freight revenue, we believe removing fuel surcharge revenue, which is sometimes a volatile source of revenue, affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period-to-period. Nonetheless, freight revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not a substitute for revenue measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Our Board and management focus on our freight revenue as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of freight revenue is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that freight revenue improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define freight revenue differently. Because of these limitations, freight revenue should not be considered a measure of total revenue generated by or available to our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses\n\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses decreased approximately $10.3 million, or 4.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased to 35.0% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 33.8% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased slightly to 38.4% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 38.2% in 2015. Salaries, wages, and related expenses decreased significantly on an overall dollar basis as a result of a 3.9% decrease in average tractors, but were relatively flat as a percentage of freight revenue, primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2015, partially offset by a decrease in non-driver incentive compensation as a result of reduced profitability in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally, group insurance costs decreased approximately $2.3 million from 2015 as a result of better claims experience.\nSalaries, wages, and related expenses increased approximately $13.0 million, or 5.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses increased to 33.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 32.2% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, salaries, wages, and related expenses declined to 38.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 40.1% in 2014. Salaries, wages, and related expenses increased approximately 2.1 cents per mile primarily due to pay adjustments for both driver and non-drivers since 2014, as well as increased non-driver incentive compensation tied to our results of operations. Additionally, group insurance costs increased approximately $0.9 million from 2014 as a result of more participants and fees directly related to the Affordable Care Act and we had additional costs of approximately $1.0 million due to an increase in non-driver headcount as a result of the increased average number of units. These increases were partially offset by lower workers' compensation expense in 2015 at 1.7 cents per company mile compared to 3.4 cents in 2014 due to fewer claims with less severity. Additionally, we had an increase in the percentage of our fleet comprised of independent contractors, whose costs are included in the purchased transportation line item.\nGoing forward, we believe salaries, wages, and related expenses will increase as a result of a tight driver market, wage inflation, higher healthcare costs, and, in certain periods, increased incentive compensation due to better performance. In particular, we expect driver pay to increase as we look to reduce the number of unseated tractors in our fleet in a tight market for drivers. Additionally, when the freight market allows for an increase in rates we would expect to, as we have historically, pass a portion of those rate increases on to our professional drivers. Salaries, wages, and related expenses will fluctuate to some extent based on the percentage of revenue generated by independent contractors and our Solutions business, for which payments are reflected in the purchased transportation line item.\nFuel expense\n\nWe receive a fuel surcharge on our loaded miles from most shippers; however, this does not cover the entire increase in fuel prices for several reasons, including the following: surcharges cover only loaded miles we operate; surcharges do not cover miles driven out-of-route by our drivers; and surcharges typically do not cover refrigeration unit fuel usage or fuel burned by tractors while idling. Moreover, most of our business relating to shipments obtained from freight brokers does not carry a fuel surcharge. Finally, fuel surcharges vary in the percentage of reimbursement offered, and not all surcharges fully compensate for fuel price increases even on loaded miles.\nThe rate of fuel price changes also can have an impact on results. Most fuel surcharges are based on the average fuel price as published by the DOE for the week prior to the shipment, meaning we typically bill customers in the current week based on the previous week's applicable index. Therefore, in times of increasing fuel prices, we do not recover as much as we are currently paying for fuel. In periods of declining prices, the opposite is true. Fuel prices as measured by the DOE averaged approximately $0.40 cents per gallon lower in 2016 compared with 2015 and $1.12 per gallon lower in 2015 compared to 2014.\nAdditionally, $16.7 million, $15.3 million, and $3.1 million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to our results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, as additional fuel expense for 2016, 2015 and 2014, related to losses on fuel hedge contracts that expired. We evaluate these contracts for \"hedge effectiveness,\" which is the extent to which the hedge contract effectively offsets changes in cash flows that the contract was intended to offset. In addition to the amounts reclassified as a result of expired contracts, we recognized a reduction of fuel expense of $1.4 million relating to previously recognized fuel expense as a result of the expiration of the fuel hedge contracts for which the fuel hedging relationship was deemed to be ineffective on a prospective basis in 2014. As a result, the changes in fair value for those contracts were recorded as expense rather than as a component of other comprehensive loss. At December 31, 2016, all fuel hedge contracts were deemed to be effective and thus continue to qualify as cash flow hedges. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded on the contracts that existed at December 31, 2016. The ineffectiveness was calculated using the cumulative dollar offset method as an estimate of the difference in the expected cash flows of the respective fuel hedge contracts compared to the changes in the all-in cash outflows required for the diesel fuel purchases.\nTo measure the effectiveness of our fuel surcharge program, we subtract fuel surcharge revenue (other than the fuel surcharge revenue we reimburse to independent contractors and other third parties, which is included in purchased transportation) from our fuel expense. The result is referred to as net fuel expense. Our net fuel expense as a percentage of freight revenue is affected by the cost of diesel fuel net of fuel surcharge collection, the percentage of miles driven by company tractors, our fuel economy, and our percentage of deadhead miles, for which we do not receive material fuel surcharge revenues. Net fuel expense is shown below:\n\nTotal fuel expense decreased approximately $19.1 million, or 15.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 15.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 16.9% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.9% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 19.1% in 2015. These decreases primarily related to lower fuel prices and an increase in our average fuel miles per gallon during 2016 as a result of purchasing equipment with more fuel-efficient engines. The decreases were partially offset by increased net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $16.7 million in 2016 compared to $13.9 million in 2015.\nNet fuel expense increased $3.7 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense increased 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. These increases primarily resulted from lower fuel surcharge recovery as a result of increased broker freight and the tiered reimbursement structure of certain fuel surcharge agreements. The increases were partially offset by improved miles per gallon due to new engine technology, internal fuel efficiency initiatives, and a greater percentage of miles driven by independent contractors.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, total fuel expense decreased approximately $46.7 million, or 27.7%, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 16.9% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 23.5% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, total fuel expense decreased to 19.1% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 29.2% in 2014. These decreases primarily related to an increase in our average fuel miles per gallon during 2015 as a result of purchasing equipment with more fuel-efficient engines. The decreases were partially offset by net losses from fuel hedging transactions of $13.9 million in 2015 compared to $3.1 million in 2014. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2014 we recognized an approximately $0.9 million fuel tax credit related to amended fuel tax returns for the years 2010 - 2013.\nNet fuel expense increased $6.9 million, or 17.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, net fuel expense increased 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. These increases primarily resulted from lower fuel surcharge recovery. The increases were partially offset by improved miles per gallon due to new engine technology, internal fuel efficiency initiatives, a greater percentage of miles driven by independent contractors, and an approximately $0.9 million fuel tax credit taken during the second quarter of 2014 related to amended fuel tax returns for the years 2010 - 2013.\nWe expect to continue managing our idle time and tractor speeds, investing in more fuel-efficient tractors to improve our miles per gallon, locking in fuel hedges when deemed appropriate, and partnering with customers to adjust fuel surcharge programs that are inadequate to recover a fair portion of fuel costs. Going forward, our net fuel expense is expected to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue based on factors such as diesel fuel prices, percentage recovered from fuel surcharge programs, percentage of uncompensated miles, percentage of revenue generated by team-driven tractors (which tend to generate higher miles and lower revenue per mile, thus proportionately more fuel cost as a percentage of revenue), percentage of revenue generated by refrigerated operation (which uses diesel fuel for refrigeration, but usually does not recover fuel surcharges on refrigeration fuel), percentage of revenue generated from independent contractors, the success of fuel efficiency initiatives, and gains and losses on fuel hedging contracts.\nGiven recent historical lows, we would expect diesel fuel prices to remain flat or increase over the next few years. However, due to hedging contracts being locked in at a lower rate on a portion of our expected gallons compared to 2016 and 2015, we expect net fuel cost to significantly decline in 2017 and 2018.\nOperations and maintenance\n\nOperations and maintenance decreased $0.6 million, or 1.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, operations and maintenance remained relatively even at 6.8% of total revenue in 2016, compared with 6.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance increased to 7.5% of freight revenue for 2016, from 7.3% in 2015 due to an increase in unloading and other operational costs associated with our increase in dedicated freight, partially offset by lower maintenance cost on our revenue equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, operations and maintenance decreased $0.8 million, or 1.7%, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, operations and maintenance remained relatively even at 6.4% of total revenue in 2015, compared with 6.6% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, operations and maintenance decreased to 7.3% of freight revenue for 2015, from 8.2% in 2014 due to a decrease in our average age of equipment partially offset by increased driver recruiting costs.\nGoing forward, we believe this category will fluctuate based on several factors, including our continued ability to maintain a relatively young fleet, accident severity and frequency, weather, and the reliability of new and untested revenue equipment models.\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation\n\nRevenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased approximately $1.1 million, or 0.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 17.5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 16.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 19.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 18.5% in 2015. These changes were primarily the result of a $0.7 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers related to increased revenues at our Solutions subsidiary and growth of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in leased equipment rental payments due to a reduction in our trailers under operating leases from 2,239 at December 31, 2105 to 1,695 at December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased approximately $6.8 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to 16.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 15.5% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased to 18.5% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 19.3% in 2014. These changes were primarily the result of a $14.4 million increase in payments to third-party transportation providers related to increased revenues at our Solutions subsidiary, growth of our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering and an increase in payments to independent contractors, which comprised a larger percentage of our total fleet. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in leased equipment rental payments and by lower fuel surcharge pass-through payments to independent contractors and third party carriers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, miles run by independent contractors increased to 9.0% of our total miles from 8.2% for 2014, and tractors under operating leases decreased to 115 units from 150 units in 2014. We expect revenue equipment rentals to decrease going forward as a result of our increase in acquisition of revenue equipment through financed purchases or capital leases rather than operating leases. As discussed below, this decrease may be partially or fully offset by an increase in purchased transportation as we expect to continue to grow our Solutions and intermodal service offerings.\nWe expect purchased transportation to increase as we seek to grow our Solutions subsidiary and if fuel prices continue to increase, which would result in an increase in what we pay third party carriers and independent contractors. However, this expense category will fluctuate with the number and percentage of loads hauled by independent contractors, loads handled by Solutions, and tractors, trailers, and other assets financed with operating leases. In addition, factors such as the cost to obtain third party transportation services, and growth of our intermodal service offerings, and the amount of fuel surcharge revenue passed through to the third party carriers and independent contractors will affect this expense category. If industry-wide trucking capacity were to tighten in relation to freight demand, we may need to increase the amounts we pay to third-party transportation providers, independent contractors, and intermodal transportation providers, which could increase this expense category on an absolute basis and as a percentage of freight revenue absent an offsetting increase in revenue. We continue to actively recruit independent contractors and, if we are successful, we would expect this line item to increase as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating taxes and licenses\n\nFor the periods presented, the change in operating taxes and licenses was not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nInsurance and claims\n\nInsurance and claims, consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability, physical damage, and cargo damage insurance and claims, increased approximately $0.7 million, or 2.2%, for year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, insurance and claims increased to 4.9% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 4.4% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims increased to 5.3% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 5.0% in 2015. These increases are primarily related to the non-recurring $3.6 million benefit in the second quarter of 2015 from commutation of our auto liability policy for the period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014. These increases also resulted from increased accident severity, resulting in total insurance cost increasing to 10.3 cents per mile for 2016 from 9.6 cents per mile in 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreased accident rates in 2016, as measured by a 6.8% improvement in DOT reportable accidents per million miles driven at 0.82% - the second lowest in the last ten years.\nInsurance and claims decreased approximately $7.7 million, or 19.4%, for year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, insurance and claims decreased to 4.4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 5.5% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, insurance and claims decreased to 5.0% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 6.8% in 2014. These decreases are primarily related to the difference between the approximately $7.5 million of additional reserves related to the adverse judgment in 2014 regarding a 2008 cargo claim compared with the $3.6 million benefit in the second quarter of 2015 from commutation of our auto liability policy for the period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014. Excluding the 2008 cargo claim, insurance and claims cost per mile decreased to 9.6 cents per mile in 2015 from 9.9 cents per mile in 2014.\nOur auto liability (personal injury and property damage), cargo, and general liability insurance programs include significant self-insured retention amounts. The auto liability policy contains a feature whereby we are able to retroactively obtain a partial refund of the premium in exchange for taking on the liability for incidents that occurred during the period and releasing the insurers. This is referred to as \"commuting\" the policy or \"policy commutation.\" In several past periods, including the policy period from April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014, we have commuted the policy, which has lowered our insurance and claims expense. We are also self-insured for physical damage to our equipment. Because of these significant self-insured exposures, insurance and claims expense may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period. Any increase in frequency or severity of claims, or any increases to then-existing reserves, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In relation to the 2008 cargo claim reserve, the judgment was partially reversed and the proceedings were remanded to the district court for further factual determinations. If these further proceedings are resolved favorably to us, any reduction of the accrual could reduce insurance and claims expense in the period in which the claim is resolved. On the other hand, if we are not successful in such a finding or mediation, insurance and claims expense may increase as a result of continuing litigation expenses, including pre and post judgment interest. We periodically evaluate strategies to efficiently reduce our insurance and claims expense, which in the past has included the commutation of our auto liability insurance policy. We intend to evaluate our ability to commute the current policy and any such commutation could significantly impact insurance and claims expense.\nCommunications and utilities\n\nFor the periods presented, the changes in communications and utilities were not significant as either a percentage of total revenue or freight revenue.\nGeneral supplies and expenses\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, general supplies and expenses increased approximately $0.4 million, or 2.9%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, general supplies and expenses increased to 2.1% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 1.9% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, general supplies and expenses increased to 2.4% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 2.2% in 2015. These increases are primarily the result of increases in legal costs related to several large cases and an increase in travel due to the turnaround efforts at SRT.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, general supplies and expenses decreased approximately $2.9 million, or 17.4%, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, general supplies and expenses decreased to 1.9% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 2.4% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, general supplies and expenses decreased to 2.2% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 2.9% in 2014. These decreases are primarily the result of the approximately $1.2 million reversal of deferred rent expense and reduced building rent expense related to the purchase of our previously leased Chattanooga headquarters property.\nDepreciation and amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of tractors, trailers and other capital assets offset or increased, as applicable, by gains or losses on dispositions of capital assets. Depreciation and amortization in 2016 increased $11.1 million, or 18.0%, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 10.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 8.5% for 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 11.9% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 9.6% in 2015. Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $9.6 million in 2016 from 2015, primarily as a result of more owned equipment and a significant reduction on the value of used tractors resulting in a change to residual values. Losses on the disposal of property and equipment, totaled $0.8 million in 2016, compared to gains of $0.6 million in 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, depreciation and amortization increased $15.0 million, or 32.3%, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 8.5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 6.5% for 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 9.6% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 8.0% in 2014. Depreciation, consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and excluding gains and losses, increased $13.0 million in 2015 from 2014, primarily as a result of new equipment and an increase in owned tractors of approximately 500 due to a reduction in use of operating leases to finance revenue equipment. Gains on the disposal of property and equipment, totaling $0.6 million in 2015, were $2.0 million lower than 2014 due to the number, type, and mileage of the equipment sold. Additionally, depreciation increased and gains on the disposal of property and equipment decreased as a result of the softening of the used tractor market during the latter portion of the year.\nWe expect to see an increase in depreciation and amortization going forward, specifically as compared to the first and second quarters of 2016, as we continue to recognize the impact of the significant reductions in residual values, which should lessen on a comparative basis in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, if the used tractor market were to decline further, we could have to adjust residual values again and increase depreciation or experience increased losses on sale.\nInterest expense, net\n\nInterest expense, net includes interest expense, interest income, and other miscellaneous non-operating items, which decreased approximately $0.2 million, or 2.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, other expense, net remained flat with 2015 at 1.2% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, other expense, net remained flat at 1.3% of freight revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The dollar decrease is primarily the result of the decrease in debt at a lower average interest rate.\nInterest expense, net, decreased approximately $2.3 million, or 21.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, other expense, net remained relatively even with 2014 at 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, other expense, net decreased to 1.3% of freight revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. These decreases are primarily the result of the repayments of debt and capital leases from the proceeds of our late November 2014 follow-on stock offering partially offset by the increase in debt at a lower average interest rate related to the August 2015 purchase of our corporate headquarters.\nThis line item will fluctuate based on our decision with respect to purchasing revenue equipment with balance sheet debt versus operating leases as well as our ability to continue to generate profitable results and reduce our leverage.\nEquity in income of affiliate\n\nWe have accounted for our investment in TEL using the equity method of accounting and thus our financial results include our proportionate share of TEL's net income. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the increase in TEL's contributions to our results was due to their growth in both leasing and tractor sales. Given TEL's growth during the three years preceding 2015 and volatility in the used and leased equipment markets in which TEL operates, including the recent softening of the used tractor market, the impact on our earnings resulting from our investment and TEL's profitability was more moderate in 2016. Given the decline in the used and leased equipment markets in which TEL operates, we expect the impact on our earnings resulting from our investment in TEL to moderate over the next twelve months.\nIncome tax expense\n\nIncome tax expense decreased approximately $11.4 million, or 52.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, income tax expense decreased to 1.5% of total revenue for 2016 from 3.0% in 2015. As a percentage of freight revenue, income tax expense decreased to 1.7% of freight revenue for 2016 compared to 3.4% in 2015. These decreases were primarily related to the $36.7 million decrease in pre-tax income in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting from the declines in operating income noted above, the decrease in the contribution from TEL's earnings, and the large non-recurring tax credit in fiscal year 2015.\nIncome tax expense increased approximately $7.0 million, or 47.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 2014. As a percentage of total revenue, income tax expense increased to 3.0% of total revenue for 2015 from 2.1% in 2014. As a percentage of freight revenue, income tax expense increased to 3.4% of freight revenue for 2015 compared to 2.6% in 2014. These increases were primarily related to the $31.3 million increase in the pre-tax income in 2015 compared to 2014 resulting from the improvements in operating income noted above, a one-time federal income tax credit of approximately $4.7 million, and the increase in the contribution from TEL's earnings.\nThe effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due primarily to permanent differences related to our per diem pay structure for drivers. Due to the partial nondeductible effect of the per diem payments, our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates.\nRESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS\nWe have one reportable segment, truckload services, which we refer to as Truckload. In addition, our Solutions subsidiary has service offerings ancillary to our Truckload services, including: freight brokerage and logistics service directly and through freight brokerage agents who are paid a commission for the freight they provide and accounts receivable factoring. These operations consist of several operating segments, which neither individually nor in the aggregate meet the quantitative or qualitative reporting thresholds. As a result, these operations are grouped in \"Other.\" The operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\"Unallocated Corporate Overhead\" includes costs that are incidental to our activities and are not specifically allocated to one of the segments. The following table summarizes financial and operating data by segment:\n\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nOur Truckload revenue decreased $54.7 million, as freight revenue decreased $30.4 million and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $24.3 million. The decrease in freight revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.2% compared to 2016, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as a decrease in our average tractor fleet of 3.9% from 2015. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 1.3% decrease, or 2.2 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile and a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2015. Additionally, team driven units increased approximately 5.3% to an average of approximately 1,000 teams in 2016 compared to approximately 950 in 2015.\nOur Truckload operating income was $37.1 million less in 2016 than 2015 due to the abovementioned decrease in freight revenue. Additionally, operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, increased primarily due to increased salaries, wages, and related expenses (which was primarily due to a higher percentage of our fleet being comprised of team-driven tractors, as well as driver and non-driver employee pay increases since the same 2015 period), increased net fuel expense, and increased capital costs, partially offset by reduced workers' compensation expense and operations and maintenance expense.\nOther total revenue increased $1.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and operating income increased $1.9 million for the same period. These improvements are primarily the result of improved coordination with our Truckload segment, additional business from new customers added during the year, and the full year effect of a large customer added in 2015.\nUnallocated corporate overhead remained relatively flat as a result of a $3.2 million reduction in incentive compensation in 2016, primarily as a result of decreased profitability, partially offset by the 2015 period including the $3.6 million in return of previously expensed insurance premiums for the commutation of our primary auto liability policy for the period of April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOur Truckload revenue decreased $7.1 million, as freight revenue increased $49.6 million and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $56.7 million. The increase in freight revenue relates to an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 5.0% compared to 2014 and a $4.6 million increase in freight revenue contributed by our temperature-controlled intermodal service offering, as well as an increase in our average tractor fleet of 3.5% from 2014. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week is the result of a 5.7% increase, or 9.1 cents per mile, in average rate per total mile partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in average miles per unit when compared to 2014. Additionally, team driven units increased approximately 13.6% to an average of approximately 950 teams in 2015 compared to approximately 840 in 2014.\nOur Truckload operating income was $20.0 million higher in 2015 than 2014 due to the abovementioned increase in freight revenue. Additionally, operating costs per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenue, decreased primarily due to reduced workers' compensation expense and operations and maintenance expense partially offset by increased salaries, wages, and related expenses (which was primarily due to a higher percentage of our fleet being comprised of team-driven tractors, as well as driver and nondriver employee pay increases since the same 2014 period), increased net fuel expense, and increased capital costs.\nOther total revenue increased $12.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and operating income increased $1.9 million for the same period. These improvements are primarily the result of additional peak season freight opportunities during the fourth quarter of 2015, improved coordination with our Truckload segment, and additional business from new customers added during the year.\nThe reduction in unallocated corporate overhead primarily includes $3.6 million in return of previously expensed insurance premiums for the commutation of our primary auto liability policy for the period of April 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014, and the $1.4 million reduction in fuel expense related to the ineffective fuel hedge contracts fulfilled in 2015 that were deemed to be ineffective on a prospective basis in 2014.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur business requires significant capital investments over the short-term and the long-term. Recently, we have financed our capital requirements with borrowings under our Credit Facility, cash flows from operations, long-term operating leases, capital leases, secured installment notes with finance companies, and proceeds from the sale of our used revenue equipment. We had working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) of $47.9 million and $46.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Based on our expected financial condition, net capital expenditures, results of operations, related net cash flows, installment notes, and other sources of financing, we believe our working capital and sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our current and projected needs and we do not expect to experience material liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $12.2 million of borrowings outstanding, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately $27.2 million, and available borrowing capacity of $55.6 million under the Credit Facility. Fluctuations in the outstanding balance and related availability under our Credit Facility are driven primarily by cash flows from operations and the timing and nature of property and equipment additions that are not funded through notes payable, as well as the nature and timing of collection of accounts receivable, payments of accrued expenses, and receipt of proceeds from disposals of property and equipment.\nWith an average tractor fleet age of 1.8 years, we believe we have flexibility to manage our fleet and we plan to regularly evaluate our tractor replacement cycle, new tractor purchase requirements, and financing options.\nCash Flows\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $102.4 million in 2016 compared with $85.5 million in 2015 primarily due to the change in receivables and advances as a result of increased cash collected during 2016 related to increased 2015 year-end revenues, and the fluctuation in tax benefit/expense due to the reversal of deferred tax effects on amounts in other comprehensive income. This improvement is partially offset by net income of $16.8 million in 2016 compared to net income of $42.1 million in 2015, depreciation and amortization increasing $9.6 million in 2016, primarily as the result of the reduced residual revenue equipment value projections due to the softened used equipment market and the 2015 purchase of our previously leased Chattanooga headquarters property, and the 2015 return of $5.0 million which was previously provided by us to certain of our derivative counterparties related to the net liability position of certain of our fuel derivative instruments. The fluctuations in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily related to the timing of payments on our accrued expenses and trade accounts in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.\nNet cash flows used by investing activities were $47.3 million in 2016 compared with $147.7 million in 2015. The $100.4 million decrease in net investing activities was attributable primarily to the purchase of our corporate headquarters property in Chattanooga, Tennessee during 2015 for approximately $35.5 million, as well as a $22.9 million decrease in assets held for sale due to the timing of dispositions of used revenue equipment. During 2017 we plan to take delivery of approximately 485 new company tractors and dispose of approximately 460 used tractors. This compares to the approximately 650 new company tractors we took delivery of and the approximately 1,074 used tractors we disposed of during 2016, including 365 recorded as assets held for sale at December 31, 2015. Going forward, cash flows from disposals of equipment could be more volatile given the weakness in the used tractor market.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $51.9 million in 2016, compared with net cash flows provided by financing activities of $45.4 million in 2015. The change in net cash flows used in financing activities was primarily a function of net repayments of notes payable and the balance under our Credit Facility. These changes primarily relate to the trade cycle of our revenue equipment, including the impact of deferring receipt of proceeds of 350 tractors held for sale that were under contract to be sold in the first quarter of 2016, and cash flows from investing and operating activities discussed above. Going forward, our cash flows may fluctuate depending on the resolution of the 2008 cargo claim, future stock repurchases, and the extent of future income tax obligations.\nMaterial Debt Agreements\nWe and substantially all of our subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Borrowers\") are parties to a Third Amended and Restated Credit Facility (the \"Credit Facility\") with Bank of America, N.A., as agent (the \"Agent\") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPM,\" and together with the Agent, the \"Lenders\").\nThe Credit Facility is a $95.0 million revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted accordion feature that, so long as no event of default exists, allows us to request an increase in the revolving credit facility of up to $50.0 million, subject to Lender acceptance of the additional funding commitment. The Credit Facility includes, within our $95.0 million revolving credit facility, a letter of credit sub facility in an aggregate amount of $95.0 million and a swing line sub facility in an aggregate amount equal to the greater of $10.0 million or 10% of the Lenders' aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility from time-to-time.\nIn 2015, we entered into an eleventh amendment to the Credit Facility, which, among other things, (i) amended the \"Applicable Margin\" to improve the interest rate grid, (ii) improved the unused line fee pricing to 0.25% per annum, retroactive to July 1, 2015 (previously the fee was 0.375% per annum when availability was less than $50.0 million and 0.5% per annum when availability was at or over such amount), (iii) required each of Driven Analytic Solutions, LLC (\"DAS\") and Covenant Properties, LLC (\"CPI\") to be joined to the Credit Agreement as guarantors, (iv) required each of DAS, CPI and Star Properties Exchange, LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company, to pledge certain of its assets as security, (v) contained conditional amendments increasing the borrowing base real estate sublimit and lowering the amortization of the real estate sublimit, (vi) made technical amendments to a variety of sections, including without limitation, permitted investments, permitted stock repurchases, permitted indebtedness, and permitted liens, (vii) consented to our purchase of our headquarters, including related financing, and (viii) extended the maturity date from September 2017 to September 2018. In exchange for these amendments, we agreed to pay fees of $0.2 million. In 2016, we entered into the twelfth and thirteenth amendments to the Credit Facility, which among other things (i) increases the approved amount for share repurchases to $45.0 million, subject to certain limitations based on the available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, and (ii) permitted the formation of Heritage Insurance, Inc., and substituted certain language to ensure the federal funds rate or LIBOR would not be less than zero.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as either \"base rate loans\" or \"LIBOR loans.\" Base rate loans accrue interest at a base rate equal to the greater of the Agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.0%; while LIBOR loans accrue interest at LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.0%. The applicable rates are adjusted quarterly based on average pricing availability. The unused line fee is the product of 0.25% times the average daily amount by which the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility exceed the outstanding principal amount of revolver loans and the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. The obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets, with the notable exclusion of any real estate or revenue equipment pledged under other financing agreements, including revenue equipment installment notes and capital leases.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base limited to the lesser of (A) $95.0 million, minus the sum of the stated amount of all outstanding letters of credit; or (B) the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) the lesser of (a) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible revenue equipment, (b) 95% of the net book value of eligible revenue equipment, or (c) 35% of the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility, plus (iii) the lesser of (a) $25.0 million or (b) 65% of the appraised fair market value of eligible real estate. We had $12.2 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately $27.2 million, and available borrowing capacity of $55.6 million. The interest rate on outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2016, was 2.3% on $9.0 million of base rate loans and 4.3% on $3.2 million of LIBOR loans. Based on availability as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no fixed charge coverage requirement.\nThe Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for a facility of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the Credit Facility may be accelerated, and the Lenders' commitments may be terminated. If an event of default occurs under the Credit Facility and the Lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Credit Facility to become due and payable, this could result in a default under other debt instruments that contain acceleration or cross-default provisions. The Credit Facility contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to, among other things, debt, dividends, liens, acquisitions and dispositions outside of the ordinary course of business, and affiliate transactions. Failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions set forth in the Credit Facility could result in an event of default.\nCapital lease obligations are utilized to finance a portion of our revenue equipment and are entered into with certain finance companies who are not parties to our Credit Facility. The leases in effect at December 31, 2016 terminate in January 2017 through December 2022 and contain guarantees of the residual value of the related equipment by us. As such, the residual guarantees are included in the related debt balance as a balloon payment at the end of the related term as well as included in the future minimum capital lease payments. These lease agreements require us to pay personal property taxes, maintenance, and operating expenses.\nPricing for the revenue equipment installment notes is quoted by the respective financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders at the funding of each group of equipment acquired and include fixed annual rates for new equipment under retail installment contracts. The notes included in the funding are due in monthly installments with final maturities at various dates ranging from January 2017 to January 2022. The notes contain certain requirements regarding payment, insuring of collateral, and other matters, but do not have any financial or other material covenants or events of default except certain notes totaling $166.1 million are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additionally, certain of our fuel hedge contracts totaling $3.6 million at December 31, 2016, are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additional borrowings from the financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders are expected to be available to fund new tractors expected to be delivered in 2017, while any other property and equipment purchases, including trailers, are expected to be funded with a combination of available cash, notes, operating leases, capital leases, and/or from the Credit Facility.\nIn August 2015, we financed a portion of the purchase of our corporate headquarters, a maintenance facility, and certain surrounding property in Chattanooga, Tennessee by entering into a $28.0 million variable rate note with a third party lender. Concurrently with entering into the note, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively fix the related interest rate to 4.2%. See Note 13 for further information about the interest rate swap.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016:\n\n (1) Represents principal and interest payments owed at December 31, 2016. The borrowings consist of installment notes with finance companies, with fixed borrowing amounts and fixed interest rates, except for a variable rate real estate note, for which the interest rate is effectively fixed through an interest rate swap. The table assumes these installment notes are held to maturity. Refer to Note 7, \"Debt\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (2) Represents future monthly rental payment obligations under operating leases for tractors, trailers, and terminal properties, and computer and office equipment. Substantially all lease agreements for revenue equipment have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. The tractor lease agreements generally stipulate maximum miles and provide for mileage penalties for excess miles. These leases generally run for a period of three to five years for tractors and five to seven years for trailers. Refer to Note 8, \"Leases\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (3) Represents principal and interest payments owed at December 31, 2016. The borrowings consist of capital leases with one finance company, with fixed borrowing amounts and fixed interest rates. Borrowings in 2017 and thereafter include the residual value guarantees on the related equipment as balloon payments. Refer to Note 7, \"Debt\" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (4) Represents purchase obligations for revenue equipment totaling approximately $86.5 million in 2016. These commitments are cancelable, subject to certain adjustments in the underlying obligations and benefits. These purchase commitments are expected to be financed by operating leases, capital leases, long-term debt, proceeds from sales of existing equipment, and/or cash flows from operations. Refer to Notes 7 and 8, \"Debt\" and \"Leases,\" respectively, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. (5) Excludes any amounts accrued for unrecognized tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of such unrecognized tax benefits. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOperating leases are an important source of financing for our revenue equipment and certain real estate. At December 31, 2016, we had financed 135 tractors and 1,695 trailers under operating leases. Vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our consolidated balance sheets, and lease payments, in respect of such vehicles, are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the line item \"Revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation.\" Our revenue equipment rental expense was $10.6 million in 2016, compared with $12.4 million in 2015. The total value of remaining payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2016, was approximately $17.5 million. In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. The residual guarantees expire between August 2018 and February 2019 and had an undiscounted value of approximately $4.0 million at December 31, 2016. The discounted present value of the total remaining lease payments and residual value guarantees were approximately $18.7 million at December 31, 2016. We expect our residual guarantees to approximate the market value at the end of the lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make decisions based upon estimates, assumptions, and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances. Such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application, the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures. Changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those anticipated. A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the consolidated financial statements attached hereto. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue, drivers' wages, and other direct operating expenses generated by our Truckload reportable segment are recognized on the date shipments are delivered to the customer. Revenue includes transportation revenue, fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention, and other accessorial services.\nRevenue generated by our Solutions subsidiary is recognized upon completion of the services provided. Revenue is recorded on a gross basis, without deducting third party purchased transportation costs, as we act as a principal with substantial risks as primary obligor, except for transactions whereby equipment from our Truckload segment perform the related services, which we record on a net basis in accordance with the related authoritative guidance. Solutions revenue includes $2.6 million, $2.4 million, and $2.3 million of revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, related to an accounts receivable factoring business. Revenue for this business is recognized on a net basis, given we are acting as an agent and are not the primary obligor in these transactions.\nDepreciation of Revenue Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for book purposes is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, while depreciation for tax purposes is generally recorded using an accelerated method. Depreciation of revenue equipment is our largest item of depreciation. We generally depreciate new tractors (excluding day cabs) over five years to salvage values of approximately 15% of their cost and new trailers over seven years for refrigerated trailers and ten years for dry van trailers to salvage values of approximately 25% of their cost. We annually review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long-lived assets based upon, among other things, our experience with similar assets, conditions in the used revenue equipment market, and prevailing industry practice. Over the past several years, the price of new tractors has risen dramatically and there has been significant volatility in the used equipment market. As a result of the progressive decline in the market value of used tractors and our expectations that used tractor prices will not rebound in the near term, effective July 1, 2016 we reduced the salvage values on our tractors and, thus, prospectively increased depreciation expense. Estimates around the salvage values and useful lives for trailers remain unchanged. The impact in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 is approximately $2.0 million of additional depreciation expense per quarter or approximately $1.2 million per quarter net of tax, which represents approximately $0.06 per common or diluted share. Based on the prospective nature of this change, we expect depreciation and expense, including gains and losses, to approximate those levels of the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Changes in the useful life or salvage value estimates, or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates, could have a material effect on our results of operations. Gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn 2016 we had a net loss on revenue equipment of $0.8 million, and in 2015 and 2014 we generated net gains on revenue equipment, including assets held for sale, of $0.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively. We review salvage values of our revenue equipment annually and make adjustments periodically, based on trends in the used equipment market, to reflect updated estimates of fair value at disposal.\nWe lease certain revenue equipment under capital leases with terms of approximately 60 to 84 months. Amortization of leased assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense.\nPursuant to applicable accounting standards, revenue equipment and other long-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates impairment may exist. Expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred. If the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long-lived asset, then an impairment loss is recognized. We measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised value of the assets, as appropriate.\nAlthough a portion of our tractors are protected by non-binding indicative trade-in values or binding trade-back agreements with the manufacturers, some tractors and substantially all of our owned trailers continue to be subject to fluctuations in market prices for used revenue equipment. Moreover, our trade-back agreements are contingent upon reaching acceptable terms for the purchase of new equipment. Further declines in the price of used revenue equipment or failure to reach agreement for the purchase of new tractors with the manufacturers issuing trade-back agreements could result in impairment of, or losses on the sale of, revenue equipment. Historically, only a de minimus percentage of our equipment has been sold back to the dealers pursuant to the trade back agreements as we have generally found that market prices exceeded the trade back allowances, although in recent years, trade back allowances have increased as a result of the increasing cost of the underlying equipment.\nAssets Held For Sale\nAssets held for sale include property and revenue equipment no longer utilized in continuing operations which are available and held for sale. Assets held for sale are no longer subject to depreciation, and are recorded at the lower of depreciated book value or fair market value less selling costs. We periodically review the carrying value of these assets for possible impairment. We expect to sell these assets within twelve months.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe classify intangible assets into two categories: (i) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization and (ii) goodwill. We have no goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We test intangible assets with definite lives for impairment if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. We record an impairment charge when the carrying value of the definite lived intangible asset is not recoverable by the cash flows generated from the use of the asset.\nWe determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement, the history of the asset, our long-term strategy for the use of the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, generally on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, ranging from 4 to 20 years. We have no identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016, and $0.2 million at December 31, 2015, which was recorded in other assets.\nInsurance and Other Claims\nThe primary claims arising against us consist of auto liability (personal injury and property damage), workers' compensation, cargo, commercial liability, and employee medical expenses. Our insurance program involves self-insurance with the following risk retention levels (before giving effect to any commutation of an auto liability policy):\n\nDue to our significant self-insured retention amounts, we have exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims and to variations between our estimated and actual ultimate payouts. We accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims and an estimate for allocated loss adjustment expenses including legal and other direct costs associated with a claim. Estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim, historical trends, advice from third-party administrators and insurers, the size of any potential damage award based on factors such as the specific facts of individual cases, the jurisdictions involved, the prospect of punitive damages, future medical costs, and inflation estimates of future claims development, and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims. We have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed, or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to estimates within our self-insured retention layers, we also must make judgments concerning claims where we have third party insurance and for claims outside our coverage limits. Upon settling claims and expenses associated with claims where we have third party coverage, we are generally required to initially fund payment to the claimant and seek reimbursement from the insurer. Receivables from insurers for claims and expenses we have paid on behalf of insurers were $0.7 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in drivers' advances and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we accrue claims above our self-insured retention and record a corresponding receivable for amounts we expect to collect from insurers upon settlement of such claims. We have less than $0.1 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a receivable in other assets and as a corresponding accrual in the long-term portion of insurance and claims accruals on our consolidated balance sheet for claims above our self-insured retention for which we believe it is reasonably assured that the insurers will provide their portion of such claims. We evaluate collectability of the receivables based on the credit worthiness and surplus of the insurers, along with our prior experience and contractual terms with each. If any claim occurrence were to exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we would have to accrue for the excess amount. Our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and, if so, by how much. If one or more claims were to exceed our then effective coverage limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also make judgments regarding the ultimate benefit versus risk to commuting certain periods within our auto liability policy. If we commute a policy, we assume 100% risk for covered claims in exchange for a policy refund. In April 2015, we commuted two liability policies for the period from April 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014, such that we are now responsible for any claim that occurred during that period up to $20.0 million, should such a claim develop. We recorded a $3.6 million reduction in insurance and claims expense in the second quarter of 2015 related to the commutation. The insurer did not remit the premium refund directly to the Company, but rather applied a credit to the current auto liability insurance policy, such that we recorded the policy release premium refund as a prepaid asset at June 30, 2015.\nEffective April 2015, we entered into new auto liability policies with a three-year term. As a result of the commutation and the Company's improved safety statistics over the prior policy, the Company received favorable premium pricing for the policy period, which we expect will reduce the fixed portion of insurance expense during such period. The policy includes a limit for a single loss of $9.0 million, an aggregate of $18.0 million for each policy year, and a $30.0 million aggregate for the three-year period ended March 31, 2018. The policy includes a policy release premium refund of up to $13.6 million, less any future amounts paid on claims by the insurer, from October 1, 2014 through March 31, 2018, if we were to commute the policy for the entire three years. A decision with respect to commutation of the policy cannot be made before April 1, 2018, unless both we and the insurance carrier agree to a commutation prior to the end of the policy term. Management cannot predict whether or not future claims or the development of existing claims will justify a commutation, and accordingly, no related amounts were recorded at December 31, 2016.\nIf claims development factors that are based upon historical experience change by 10%, our claims accrual as of December 31, 2016, would change by approximately $1.1 million.\nLease Accounting and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\nWe issue residual value guarantees in connection with the operating leases we enter into for certain of our revenue equipment. These leases provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value. To the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee, we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term. We believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would equal or exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases. The estimated values at lease termination involve management judgments. As leases are entered into, determination as to the classification as an operating or capital lease involves management judgments on residual values and useful lives.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We believe the future tax deductions will be realized principally through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income, except for when a valuation allowance has been provided.\nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nStock-Based Employee Compensation\nWe issue several types of stock-based compensation, including awards that vest based on service and performance conditions or a combination of the conditions. Performance-based awards vest contingent upon meeting certain performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee. All awards require future service and thus forfeitures are estimated based on historical forfeitures and the remaining term until the related award vests. For performance-based awards, determining the appropriate amount to expense in each period is based on likelihood and timing of achieving the stated targets and requires judgment, including forecasting future financial results. The estimates are revised periodically based on the probability and timing of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate. Awards that are only subject to time vesting provisions are amortized using the straight-line method.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, commodity contracts, accounts payable, debt, and interest rate swaps. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current debt approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the factored receivables approximates the fair value, as the receivables are generally repaid directly to us by the client's customer within 30-40 days due to the combination of the short-term nature of the financing transaction and the underlying quality of the receivables. Interest rates that are currently available to us for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of our long-term debt, which primarily consists of revenue equipment installment notes. The fair value of our revenue equipment installment notes approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2016, as the weighted average interest rate on these notes approximates the market rate for similar debt. Borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility approximate fair value due to the variable interest rate on the facility. Additionally, commodity contracts, which are accounted for as hedge derivatives, as discussed in Note 13, are valued based on the forward rate of the specific indices upon which the contract is being settled and adjusted for counterparty credit risk using available market information and valuation methodologies. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. The variable-cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the swap, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using \"significant unobservable inputs\" such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe periodically utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in fuel prices and interest rates. At inception of a derivative contract, we document relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various derivative transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness. We record derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability at fair value. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion is recorded in other income or expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards adopted\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2015-03, and in August 2015, issued ASU 2015-15. These ASUs require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt consistent with debt discounts. The presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit, may be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by these ASUs. These ASUs are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard for the fiscal year 2016.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid-in-capital pools. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance is effective in 2017 with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard effective for the fiscal year 2016 resulting in the recording of $2.2 million to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2016, and $1.1 million of additional income tax benefit in 2016 as a result of previously unrecognized tax benefits resulting from our net operating loss carryovers. The statement of cash flows has not been adjusted for prior periods, as we have adopted the statement of cash flow guidance prospectively.\nAccounting Standards not yet adopted\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The new standard introduces a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The premise of the new model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will be effective for the Company for its annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect. We are in the process of evaluating the new standard, but we believe our revenue recognized under the new standard will generally approximate revenue under current standards and, while we expect an impact to both revenue and certain variable expenses as a result of the adoption, we expect that the net impact to equity or earnings on a prospective basis will not be material. We plan to complete our evaluation in 2017, including an assessment of the new expanded disclosure requirements and a final determination of the transition method we will use to adopt the new standard.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease obligation for all leases. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize an asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lessor accounting under the new standard is substantially unchanged. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required. This new standard will become effective for us in our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period and requires a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently evaluating the impacts the adoption of this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nINFLATION, NEW EMISSIONS CONTROL REGULATIONS, AND FUEL COSTS\nMost of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations. During the past five years, the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the related depreciation, health care, and driver and non-driver wages. New emissions control regulations and increases in wages of manufacturing workers and other items have resulted in higher tractor prices, while the decline in the market value of used equipment significantly reduced the residual values of units in fiscal 2015 and 2016. The cost of fuel has been extremely volatile over the last several years, with costs decreasing significantly in both 2016 and 2015 after trending upward in 2010 through 2014. We believe at least some of this volatility reflects the fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and global demand for petroleum products, unrest in certain oil-producing countries, improved fuel efficiency due to technological advancements, and an increase in domestic supply. Health care prices have increased faster than general inflation, primarily due to the rapid increase in prescription drug costs and more people on our health plan in order to comply with the individual healthcare mandate. The nationwide shortage of qualified drivers has caused us to raise driver wages per mile at a rate faster than general inflation for the past four years, and this trend may continue as additional government regulations constrain industry capacity. Additionally, competition and the related cost to employ non-drivers have increased, especially for the more skilled or technical positions, including mechanics, those with information technology related skills, and degreed professionals.\nSEASONALITY\nOver the past three years, we have experienced marked surges in business and profitability during the fourth quarter holiday season, due to our team drivers and customer base. After this surge, revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments following the holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather, creating more physical damage equipment repairs. For the reasons stated, first quarter results historically have been lower than results in each of the other three quarters of the year, excluding charges. In recent years, we have seen the duration of the fourth quarter holiday \"peak\" season become compressed as consumers have come to expect shorter and shorter shipping times and our customers' networks have adjusted accordingly. If this trend continues, our ability to take advantage of this surge in business and our fourth quarter profitability could be negatively affected.", "item_7_tables": "Table 28: <table> <tr> <td> Operating Ratio ( OR\u201d) From 2014 to 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP Operating Ratio:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> OR %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 670,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,240\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 718,980\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 638,204\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 95.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 656,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 90.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 679,334\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 94.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,646\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Operating Ratio:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Adj.

provides a comprehensive overview of the financial status and operations of a company as of December 31st, 2016. It includes discussions on forward-looking statements, management insights, financial outcomes, and future expectations.\n\nKey takeaways include:\n\n- The report contains forward-looking statements protected under U.S. law, which encompass projections of earnings, strategic plans, and various other aspects related to the company's operations and predictions of future performance.\n- The company did not perform as well in 2016 as in the previous year, which was a record year for the company. Key financial metrics declined, including total and freight revenue, operating income, and net income.\n- The Truckload segment experienced a decline in demand resulting in reduced miles traveled per tractor each week and a decreased average tractor count. This decline was partially offset by a rise in the number of team tractors.\n- Non-Truckload operations grew both in revenue and profitability due to favorable market dynamics and the full-year impact of business changes made the previous year.\n- The company continued to focus on reducing debt and improving tangible book value per share, leading to a significant decrease in total indebtedness and improved equity valuations.\n- The report also provides more detailed financial tables and discussions regarding the company\u2019s operating ratio, outlook for future performance, consolidated operations results, liquidity and capital resources, accounting policies, debt agreements, and contractual obligations.\n\nFor 2016, the company projects a sequential improvement with lower earnings in the first half of the year compared to 2016 but anticipates an improved economy, e-commerce growth, and strategic changes to support better performance in the second half of 2017. This improvement could result in higher annual earnings for the year. The company also outlines plans for investments, operating cash flows, and further debt reduction.\n\nIn the accounting section, the company details their critical policies and estimates, such as revenue recognition, depreciation of revenue equipment, accounting for insurance and claims, stock-based compensation, fair value of financial instruments, and the handling of derivative instruments and hedging activities. Recent accounting pronouncements, both adopted and not yet adopted, are discussed to forecast adjustments to financial reporting in the upcoming periods.\n\nLastly, the report addresses the potential impacts of inflation, new emissions control regulations, and fluctuating fuel costs on the company's operations, as well as acknowledging the seasonality in the transportation industry that can affect quarterly results."}
