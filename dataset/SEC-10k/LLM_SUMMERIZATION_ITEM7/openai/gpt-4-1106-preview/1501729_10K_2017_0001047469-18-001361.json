We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the minimum offering requirement, we had no operations except for matters relating to our organization. In November 2016, we closed our continuous public offering of common shares to new investors.\nOur investment activities are managed by FS Advisor and supervised by our board of trustees, a majority of whom are independent. Under our investment advisory and administrative services agreement, we have agreed to pay FS Advisor an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as incentive fees based on our performance. FS Advisor engaged GSO to act as our investment sub-adviser. GSO currently assists FS Advisor in identifying investment opportunities and makes investment recommendations for approval by FS Advisor according to guidelines set by FS Advisor.\nOur investment policy is to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of our total assets in securities of Energy companies. This investment policy may not be changed without at least 60 days' prior notice to holders of our common shares of any such change.\nAs we previously announced on December 11, 2017, GSO intends to resign as our investment sub-adviser and terminate the investment sub-advisory agreement effective as of the GSO end date. In connection with GSO's resignation as our investment sub-adviser, FS Advisor and its affiliates and EIG desire to enter into a relationship whereby FS Advisor and EIG will jointly provide management, investment advisory and administrative services to us through FS/EIG Advisor. See \"-The Transition of Investment Advisory Services\" for information regarding our potential investment advisory relationship with FS/EIG Advisor.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. We have identified and intend to focus on the following investment categories, which we believe will allow us to generate an attractive total return with an acceptable level of risk.\nDirect Originations: We intend to leverage our relationships and, currently, our relationship with GSO and its global sourcing and origination platform, including its industry relationships, to directly source investment opportunities. Such investments are originated or structured for us or made by us and are not generally available to the broader market. These investments may include both debt and equity components, although we do not expect to make equity investments (other than income-oriented equity investments) independent of having an existing credit relationship. We believe directly originated investments may offer higher returns and more favorable protections than broadly syndicated transactions.\nOpportunistic: We seek to capitalize on market price inefficiencies by investing in loans, bonds and other securities where the market price of such investment reflects a lower value than deemed warranted by our fundamental analysis. We believe that market price inefficiencies may occur due to, among other things, general dislocations in the markets, a misunderstanding by the market of a particular company or an Energy industry sub-sector being out of favor with the broader investment community. We seek to allocate capital to these securities that have been misunderstood or mispriced by the market and where we believe there is an opportunity to earn an attractive return on our investment. Such opportunities may include both event driven investments and anchor orders.\nIn the case of event driven investments, we intend to take advantage of dislocations that arise in the markets due to an impending event and where the market's apparent expectation of value differs substantially from our fundamental analysis. Such events may include a looming debt maturity or default, a merger, spin-off or other corporate reorganization, an adverse regulatory or legal ruling, or a material contract expiration, any of which may significantly improve or impair a company's financial position. Compared to other investment strategies, event driven investing depends more heavily on our ability to successfully predict the outcome of an individual event rather than on underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. As a result, successful event driven strategies may offer both substantial diversification benefits and the ability to generate performance in uncertain market environments.\nWe may also invest in certain opportunities that are originated and then syndicated by a commercial or investment bank but where we provide a capital commitment significantly above the average syndicate participant, i.e., an anchor order. In these types of investments, we may receive fees, preferential pricing or other benefits not available to other lenders in return for our significant capital commitment. Our decision to provide an anchor order to a syndicated transaction is predicated on a rigorous credit analysis, our familiarity with a particular company, Energy industry sub-sector or financial sponsor, and the broader investment experiences of FS Advisor and GSO.\nBroadly Syndicated/Other: Although our primary focus is to invest in directly originated transactions and opportunistic investments, in certain circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and provide a complement to our less liquid strategies. In addition, and because we typically receive more attractive financing terms on these positions than we do on our less liquid assets, we are able to leverage the broadly syndicated portion of our portfolio in such a way that maximizes the levered return potential of our portfolio.\nOur portfolio is comprised primarily of income-oriented securities, which refers to debt securities and income-oriented preferred and common equity interests, of privately-held Energy companies within the United States. We intend to weight our portfolio towards senior and subordinated debt. In addition to investments purchased from dealers or other investors in the secondary market, we expect to invest in primary market transactions and directly originated investments as this will provide us with the ability to tailor investments to best match a project's or company's needs with our investment objectives. Our portfolio may also be comprised of select income-oriented preferred or common equity interests, which refers to equity interests that pay consistent, high-yielding dividends, that we believe will produce both current income and long-term capital appreciation. These income-oriented preferred or common equity interests may include interests in master limited partnerships. In connection with certain of our debt investments or any restructuring of these debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests, including warrants or options, as additional consideration or otherwise in connection with a restructuring.\nRevenues\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency. Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign\ndenominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investments. Net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. We also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we may hold. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of advisory fees and other expenses under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other expenses necessary for our operations. Our investment advisory fee compensates FS Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. FS Advisor is responsible for compensating our investment sub-adviser.\nWe reimburse FS Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FS Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments providing administrative services to us on behalf of FS Advisor. Such services include the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. FS Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FS Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.\nThe amount of the reimbursement payable to FS Advisor is set at the lesser of (1) FS Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that we estimate we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS Advisor is required to allocate the cost of such services to us based on factors such as assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. Our board of trustees reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of the administrative expenses among us and certain affiliates of FS Advisor. Our board of trustees then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of trustees considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of trustees, among other things, compares the total amount paid to FS Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse FS Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FS Advisor.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\n\u2022 corporate and organization expenses relating to offerings of our common shares, subject to limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement;\n\u2022 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party pricing or valuation services;\n\u2022 the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of our common shares and other securities;\n\u2022 investment advisory fees;\n\u2022 fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n\u2022 interest payments on our debt or related obligations;\n\u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022 research and market data (including news and quotation equipment and services, and any computer hardware and connectivity hardware (e.g. telephone and fiber optic lines) incorporated into the cost of obtaining such research and market data);\n\u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n\u2022 federal and state registration fees;\n\u2022 federal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022 annual fees of the Delaware trustee;\n\u2022 fees and expenses of our trustees not also serving in an executive officer capacity for us or FS Advisor;\n\u2022 costs of proxy statements, shareholders' reports and notices and other filings;\n\u2022 our fidelity bond, trustees and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n\u2022 direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n\u2022 fees and expenses associated with accounting, corporate governance, government and regulatory affairs activities, independent audits and outside legal costs;\n\u2022 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022 brokerage commissions for our investments;\n\u2022 costs associated with our chief compliance officer; and\n\u2022 all other expenses incurred by FS Advisor, GSO or us in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by FS Advisor or GSO in performing administrative services for us and administrative personnel paid by FS Advisor or GSO, to the extent they are not controlling persons of FS Advisor, GSO or any of their respective affiliates, subject to the limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement.\nIn addition, we have contracted with State Street to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by FS Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.\nFor information regarding our expense reimbursement arrangement with FS Investments, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nPortfolio Investment Activity for the Years Ended December 31, 2017

On January 2, 2018, our board of trustees reduced the regular monthly cash distribution amount to $0.041667 per share to be paid to shareholders of record for January 2018 through March 2018. Based on a distribution amount of $0.041667 per share, and the price at which we last issued shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan of $6.70 per share, the annualized distribution rate to shareholders as of February 28, 2018 was 7.46%.\nOur estimated gross portfolio yield and annualized distribution rate to shareholders do not represent actual investment returns to shareholders. Our gross annual portfolio yield and distribution rate to shareholders are subject to change and in the future may be greater or less than the rates set forth above. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. See footnote 6 to the financial highlights table included in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for information regarding the calculations of

Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.\nThe level of investment income we receive is directly related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect the dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn to increase if the size of our investment portfolio increases and the proportion of directly originated investments in our portfolio increases.\nFee income is transaction based, and typically consists of amendment and consent fees, prepayment fees, structuring fees, upfront fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, future fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees.\nExpenses\nOur operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>88,938 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>76,580 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>75,997 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated income incentive fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Administrative services expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,056 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Share transfer agent fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,757 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounting and administrative fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,405 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,703 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trustees' fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>970 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Offering costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses associated with our independent audit and related fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>552 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation of our chief compliance officer(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>686 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Printing fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,873 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,058 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Expense reimbursement from sponsor\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,260 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Expense reimbursement due to sponsor\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>132,182 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>138,093 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>152,058 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)On April 1, 2015, James F.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we offset $14,816 in management fees payable and $10,499 in subordinated income incentive fees payable by us to FS Advisor. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we accrued $5,945 for expense reimbursements that we intend to apply towards an offset in management fees payable by us to FS Advisor. Under the expense reimbursement agreement, amounts reimbursed to us by FS Investments may become subject to repayment by us in future periods. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $2,858 in expense recoupments to FS Investments or its affiliates. During\nthe years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not accrue any expense reimbursements that FS Investments has agreed to pay or pay any amounts in expense recoupments to FS Investments or its affiliates. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the expense reimbursement agreement.\nNet Investment Income\nOur net investment income totaled $286,574 ($0.65 per share), $231,647 ($0.57 per share) and $227,595 ($0.67 per share) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\nOur net realized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gain (loss) on investments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(91,083 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(251,431 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(201,559 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(210 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net realized gain (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(91,082 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(251,431 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(201,769 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)We sold investments and received principal repayments of $710,040 and $721,608, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017, $680,239 and $544,813, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $590,726 and $209,808, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nOur net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and foreign currency for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(308,513 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>772,361 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(537,036 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(89 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(308,462 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>772,368 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(537,125 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by the performance of our directly originated investments. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by a general improvement in the energy markets, a tightening of credit spreads and the performance of our anchor order and broadly syndicated investments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by a general widening of credit spreads in Energy markets and by the performance of our directly originated and opportunistic investments.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $(112,970) ($(0.26) per share), $752,584 ($1.84 per share) and $(511,299) ($(1.51) per share), respectively.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $195,376 in cash, which we or our wholly-owned financing subsidiaries held in custodial accounts, and $100,000 in borrowings available under our financing arrangements, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. To seek to enhance our returns, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS Advisor, but in no event may leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See \"-Financing Arrangements.\" As of December 31, 2017, we also had broadly syndicated investments and opportunistic investments that could be sold to create additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, we had four senior secured loan investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $90,662 and two equity/other investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $8,751. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nPublic Offering of Shares, Distribution Reinvestment Plan and Share Repurchase Program\nIn November 2016, we closed our continuous public offering of common shares to new investors. Following the closing of our continuous public offering, we will continue to issue shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nWe generate cash primarily from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan and from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See \"-Financing Arrangements.\"\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the net proceeds from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan as well as from sales and paydowns of existing investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nFor additional information regarding our continuous public offering, distribution reinvestment plan and share repurchase program, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe borrow funds to make investments to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities and our board of trustees determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders. We do not currently anticipate issuing any preferred shares.\nThe following table presents a summary of information with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Facility(1) </th> <th> </th> <th>Type of\nArrangement </th> <th> </th> <th>Rate </th> <th> </th> <th>Amount\nOutstanding </th> <th> </th> <th>Amount\nAvailable </th> <th> </th> <th>Maturity Date </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Barclays Credit Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving </td> <td> </td> <td>L+3.25% </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 18, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BNP Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Prime Brokerage </td> <td> </td> <td>L+1.35% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>September 27, 2018(2) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deutsche Bank Credit Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving </td> <td> </td> <td>L+2.05% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>340,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>June 11, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fortress Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Term </td> <td> </td> <td>L+5.00%(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>November 6, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goldman Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Term </td> <td> </td> <td>L+3.72% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>425,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>September 15, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,220,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The carrying amount outstanding under the facility approximates its fair value.\n(2)The BNP facility generally is terminable upon 270 days' notice by either party.

As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each tax year, dividends generally of an amount at least equal to 90% of our \"investment company taxable income,\" which is generally the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we may, in certain cases, satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement by distributing dividends relating to a tax year after the close of such tax year under the \"spillover dividend\" provisions of Subchapter M of the Code. If we distribute a spillover dividend, such dividend will be included in a shareholder's gross income for the tax year in which the spillover distribution is paid. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our shareholders to maintain our RIC tax treatment each tax year. We will also be subject to nondeductible U.S. federal excise taxes on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner to our shareholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary taxable income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains over capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to our shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. shareholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared.\nPrior to the closing of our continuous public offering in November 2016, we declared regular cash distributions on a weekly basis, and paid such distributions on a monthly basis. Subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees, we intend to declare and pay regular cash distributions on a monthly basis. We will calculate each shareholder's specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each shareholder's distributions will begin to accrue on the date that common shares are issued to such shareholder. From time to time, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees.\nDuring certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make will represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of an investor's investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with our continuous public offering, including any fees payable to FS Advisor. Moreover, a return of capital will generally not be taxable, but will reduce each shareholder's cost basis in our common shares, and will result in a higher reported capital gain or lower reported capital loss when the common shares on which such return of capital was received are sold. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders.\nWe intend to continue to make our regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution, unless shareholders elect to receive their cash distributions in additional common shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. shareholder.\nThe following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we have declared and paid on our common shares during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Distribution </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>For the Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Per Share </th> <th> </th> <th>Amount </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.7085 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>238,833 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.7085 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>288,982 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.7085 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>312,694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our distributions, including a reconciliation of our GAAP-basis net investment income to our tax-basis net investment income, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis and deferred taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nWe determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of trustees. In connection with that determination, FS Advisor provides our board of trustees with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party valuation services.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n\u2022 our quarterly fair valuation process begins with FS Advisor's management team reviewing and documenting preliminary valuations of each portfolio company or investment, which valuations may be obtained from an independent third-party valuation service, if applicable;\n\u2022 FS Advisor's management team then provides the valuation committee with the preliminary valuations for each portfolio company or investment;\n\u2022 preliminary valuations are then discussed with the valuation committee;\n\u2022 the valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations and FS Advisor's management team, together with our independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee;\n\u2022 following its review, the valuation committee will recommend that our board of trustees approve our fair valuations; and\n\u2022 our board of trustees discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each such investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of FS Advisor, the valuation committee and any independent third-party valuation services, if applicable.\nDetermination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, our board of trustees may use any approved independent third-party pricing or valuation services. However, our board of trustees is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information obtained from FS Advisor or any approved independent third-party valuation or pricing service that our board of trustees deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that FS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may consider when determining the fair value of our investments.\nValuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, we may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the portfolio company in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing our debt investments.\nFor convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used.\nOur equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Our board of trustees, in its determination of fair value, may consider various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon the particular circumstances of a portfolio company or our actual investment position. For example, adjustments to EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring or other related items.\nFS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair value. FS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider the\nsize and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, and may apply discounts or premiums, where and as appropriate, due to the higher (or lower) financial risk and/or the smaller size of portfolio companies relative to comparable firms, as well as such other factors as our board of trustees, in consultation with FS Advisor's management team and any approved independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, may consider relevant in assessing fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security.\nWhen we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. Our board of trustees subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value.\nThe fair values of our investments are determined in good faith by our board of trustees. Our board of trustees is solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Our board of trustees has delegated day-to-day responsibility for implementing our valuation policy to FS Advisor's management team, and has authorized FS Advisor's management team to utilize independent third-party valuation and pricing services that have been approved by our board of trustees. The valuation committee is responsible for overseeing FS Advisor's implementation of the valuation process.\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nRevenue Recognition\nSecurity transactions are accounted for on the trade date. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. We record dividend income on the ex-dividend date. We do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such income. Our policy is to place investments on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that interest income will be collected. We consider many factors relevant to an investment when placing it on or removing it from non-accrual status including, but not limited to, the delinquency status of the investment, economic and business conditions, the overall financial condition of the underlying investment, the value of the underlying collateral, bankruptcy status, if any, and any other facts or circumstances relevant to the investment. If there is reasonable doubt that we will receive any previously accrued interest, then the previously recognized interest income will be written-off. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the collectability of the remaining principal and interest. Non-accrual investments may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become current and are likely to remain current based on our judgment.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and we amortize such amounts as interest income over the respective term of the loan or security. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees and original issue discount are recorded as interest income. Structuring and other non-recurring upfront fees are recorded as fee income when earned. We record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as fee income when we earn such amounts.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides for revenue recognition based on the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. When it becomes effective, the new revenue recognition guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 will replace most revenue recognition guidance under existing GAAP. In 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance that clarified, amended and technically corrected prior revenue recognition guidance. The new revenue recognition guidance applies to all entities and all contracts with customers to provide goods or services in the ordinary course of business, excluding, among other things, financial instruments as well as certain other contractual rights and obligations. For public entities, the new standards are effective\nduring the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The standards permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. As a result, we are required to adopt the new guidance as of January 1, 2018 and expect to do so using the cumulative effect method applied to in-scope contracts with customers that have not been completed as of the date of adoption.\nIn connection with our evaluation of the impact of the new revenue recognition guidance on its revenue recognition polices for structuring and other non-recurring upfront fees, we have performed an analysis to identify contracts with customers within the scope of the new revenue recognition guidance and to determine the related performance obligation and transaction price. Under the new revenue recognition guidance, we expect to recognize revenue for in-scope contracts based on the transaction price as the performance obligation is fulfilled. In our analysis, we considered, among other matters, the nature of the performance obligation and constraints on including variable consideration in the transaction price. In addition, we considered the costs incurred to obtain and fulfill in-scope contracts with customers to determine whether such costs would be required to be capitalized. Based on our analysis, we expect to provide additional revenue recognition disclosures required under the new standard but do not otherwise expect a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses, Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation and Net Change in Unrealized Gains or Losses on Foreign Currency\nGains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method. We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized fees. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized and the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for any foreign denominated investments we may hold. Net change in unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency reflects the change in the value of foreign currency held, receivables or accruals during the reporting period due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nUncertainty in Income Taxes\nWe evaluate our tax positions to determine if the tax positions taken meet the minimum recognition threshold in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be taken for the purposes of measuring and recognizing tax benefits or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Recognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we did not incur any interest or penalties.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our significant accounting policies.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into an agreement with FS Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement are equal to (a) an annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average value of our gross assets and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. Effective January 1, 2018, FS Advisor agreed to (a) permanently waive a portion of its base management fee to which it is entitled under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, so that the fee received equals 1.75% of the average value of our gross assets (gross assets equals total assets as set forth on our consolidated balance sheets) and (b) waive incentive fees on income for a period of twelve months ending December 31, 2018. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of this agreement and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding indebtness at December 31, 2017 is as follows:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due By Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Maturity Date(1) </th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1-3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>3-5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than 5\nyears </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BNP Facility(2)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>September 27, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deutsche Bank Credit Facility(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>June 11, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>340,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>340,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fortress Facility(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>November 6, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>155,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>155,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goldman Facility(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>September 15, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>425,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>425,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Amounts outstanding under the financing arrangements will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on the maturity date.\n(2)The BNP facility generally is terminable upon 270 days' notice by either party. As of December 31, 2017, neither Berwyn Funding nor BNP had provided notice of its intent to terminate the facility.\n(3)At December 31, 2017, no amounts remained unused under the financing arrangement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under the Barclays credit facility. All borrowed amounts under the facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on May 18, 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices.\nRelated Party Transactions\nCompensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer Manager\nPursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FS Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. We commenced accruing fees under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement on July 18, 2011, upon commencement of our investment operations. Base management fees are paid on a quarterly basis in arrears. Effective January 1, 2018, FS Advisor agreed to (a) permanently waive a portion of its base management fee to which it is entitled under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, so that the fee received equals 1.75% of the average value of our gross assets (gross assets equals total assets as set forth on our consolidated balance sheets) and (b) waive incentive fees on income for a period of twelve months ending December 31, 2018.\nThe dealer manager for our continuous public offering was FS Investment Solutions, which is one of our affiliates. Under the dealer manager agreement among us, FS Advisor and FS Investment Solutions, or the dealer manager agreement, FS Investment Solutions was entitled to receive sales commissions and dealer manager fees in connection with the sale of common shares in our continuous public offering, all or a portion of which were re-allowed to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives. The dealer manager agreement terminated in connection with the closing of our continuous public offering in November 2016.\nSee Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our related party transactions and relationships, including a description of the fees and amounts due to FS Advisor, capital contributions by FS Advisor and GSO, potential conflicts of interest, our exemptive relief order, our expense reimbursement arrangement with FS Investments and FS Benefit Trust's purchases of our common shares.\nSee \"Business-The Transition of Advisory Services\" for information regarding GSO's resignation as our investment sub-advisor and our potential advisory relationship with FS/EIG Advisor.\nRecent Developments\nSee \"Item 1. Business-The Transition of Investment Advisory Services\" for information regarding our potential investment advisory relationship with FS/EIG Advisor.\nWaiver of Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee\nEffective January 1, 2018, FS Advisor agreed to (a) permanently waive a portion of its base management fee to which it is entitled under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, so that the fee received equals 1.75% of the average value of our gross assets and (b) waive incentive fees on income for a period of twelve months ending December 31, 2018.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the statements in this annual report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements because they relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition.

The forward-looking statements and projections contained in this annual report on Form 10-K are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.\nOverview\nWe were formed as a Delaware statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act on September 16, 2010 and formally commenced investment operations on July 18, 2011 upon raising gross proceeds in excess of $2,500 from sales of our common shares in our continuous public offering to persons who were not affiliated with us or FS Advisor. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the minimum offering requirement, we had no operations except for matters relating to our organization. In November 2016, we closed our continuous public offering of common shares to new investors.\nOur investment activities are managed by FS Advisor and supervised by our board of trustees, a majority of whom are independent. Under our investment advisory and administrative services agreement, we have agreed to pay FS Advisor an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as incentive fees based on our performance. FS Advisor engaged GSO to act as our investment sub-adviser. GSO currently assists FS Advisor in identifying investment opportunities and makes investment recommendations for approval by FS Advisor according to guidelines set by FS Advisor.\nOur investment policy is to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of our total assets in securities of Energy companies. This investment policy may not be changed without at least 60 days' prior notice to holders of our common shares of any such change.\nAs we previously announced on December 11, 2017, GSO intends to resign as our investment sub-adviser and terminate the investment sub-advisory agreement effective as of the GSO end date. In connection with GSO's resignation as our investment sub-adviser, FS Advisor and its affiliates and EIG desire to enter into a relationship whereby FS Advisor and EIG will jointly provide management, investment advisory and administrative services to us through FS/EIG Advisor. See \"-The Transition of Investment Advisory Services\" for information regarding our potential investment advisory relationship with FS/EIG Advisor.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. We have identified and intend to focus on the following investment categories, which we believe will allow us to generate an attractive total return with an acceptable level of risk.\nDirect Originations: We intend to leverage our relationships and, currently, our relationship with GSO and its global sourcing and origination platform, including its industry relationships, to directly source investment opportunities. Such investments are originated or structured for us or made by us and are not generally available to the broader market. These investments may include both debt and equity components, although we do not expect to make equity investments (other than income-oriented equity investments) independent of having an existing credit relationship. We believe directly originated investments may offer higher returns and more favorable protections than broadly syndicated transactions.\nOpportunistic: We seek to capitalize on market price inefficiencies by investing in loans, bonds and other securities where the market price of such investment reflects a lower value than deemed warranted by our fundamental analysis. We believe that market price inefficiencies may occur due to, among other things, general dislocations in the markets, a misunderstanding by the market of a particular company or an Energy industry sub-sector being out of favor with the broader investment community. We seek to allocate capital to these securities that have been misunderstood or mispriced by the market and where we believe there is an opportunity to earn an attractive return on our investment. Such opportunities may include both event driven investments and anchor orders.\nIn the case of event driven investments, we intend to take advantage of dislocations that arise in the markets due to an impending event and where the market's apparent expectation of value differs substantially from our fundamental analysis. Such events may include a looming debt maturity or default, a merger, spin-off or other corporate reorganization, an adverse regulatory or legal ruling, or a material contract expiration, any of which may significantly improve or impair a company's financial position. Compared to other investment strategies, event driven investing depends more heavily on our ability to successfully predict the outcome of an individual event rather than on underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. As a result, successful event driven strategies may offer both substantial diversification benefits and the ability to generate performance in uncertain market environments.\nWe may also invest in certain opportunities that are originated and then syndicated by a commercial or investment bank but where we provide a capital commitment significantly above the average syndicate participant, i.e., an anchor order. In these types of investments, we may receive fees, preferential pricing or other benefits not available to other lenders in return for our significant capital commitment. Our decision to provide an anchor order to a syndicated transaction is predicated on a rigorous credit analysis, our familiarity with a particular company, Energy industry sub-sector or financial sponsor, and the broader investment experiences of FS Advisor and GSO.\nBroadly Syndicated/Other: Although our primary focus is to invest in directly originated transactions and opportunistic investments, in certain circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and provide a complement to our less liquid strategies. In addition, and because we typically receive more attractive financing terms on these positions than we do on our less liquid assets, we are able to leverage the broadly syndicated portion of our portfolio in such a way that maximizes the levered return potential of our portfolio.\nOur portfolio is comprised primarily of income-oriented securities, which refers to debt securities and income-oriented preferred and common equity interests, of privately-held Energy companies within the United States. We intend to weight our portfolio towards senior and subordinated debt. In addition to investments purchased from dealers or other investors in the secondary market, we expect to invest in primary market transactions and directly originated investments as this will provide us with the ability to tailor investments to best match a project's or company's needs with our investment objectives. Our portfolio may also be comprised of select income-oriented preferred or common equity interests, which refers to equity interests that pay consistent, high-yielding dividends, that we believe will produce both current income and long-term capital appreciation. These income-oriented preferred or common equity interests may include interests in master limited partnerships. In connection with certain of our debt investments or any restructuring of these debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests, including warrants or options, as additional consideration or otherwise in connection with a restructuring.\nRevenues\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency. Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign\ndenominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investments. Net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. We also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we may hold. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of advisory fees and other expenses under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other expenses necessary for our operations. Our investment advisory fee compensates FS Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. FS Advisor is responsible for compensating our investment sub-adviser.\nWe reimburse FS Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FS Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments providing administrative services to us on behalf of FS Advisor. Such services include the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. FS Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FS Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.\nThe amount of the reimbursement payable to FS Advisor is set at the lesser of (1) FS Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that we estimate we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS Advisor is required to allocate the cost of such services to us based on factors such as assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. Our board of trustees reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of the administrative expenses among us and certain affiliates of FS Advisor. Our board of trustees then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of trustees considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of trustees, among other things, compares the total amount paid to FS Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse FS Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FS Advisor.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\n\u2022 corporate and organization expenses relating to offerings of our common shares, subject to limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement;\n\u2022 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party pricing or valuation services;\n\u2022 the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of our common shares and other securities;\n\u2022 investment advisory fees;\n\u2022 fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n\u2022 interest payments on our debt or related obligations;\n\u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022 research and market data (including news and quotation equipment and services, and any computer hardware and connectivity hardware (e.g. telephone and fiber optic lines) incorporated into the cost of obtaining such research and market data);\n\u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n\u2022 federal and state registration fees;\n\u2022 federal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022 annual fees of the Delaware trustee;\n\u2022 fees and expenses of our trustees not also serving in an executive officer capacity for us or FS Advisor;\n\u2022 costs of proxy statements, shareholders' reports and notices and other filings;\n\u2022 our fidelity bond, trustees and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n\u2022 direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n\u2022 fees and expenses associated with accounting, corporate governance, government and regulatory affairs activities, independent audits and outside legal costs;\n\u2022 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022 brokerage commissions for our investments;\n\u2022 costs associated with our chief compliance officer; and\n\u2022 all other expenses incurred by FS Advisor, GSO or us in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by FS Advisor or GSO in performing administrative services for us and administrative personnel paid by FS Advisor or GSO, to the extent they are not controlling persons of FS Advisor, GSO or any of their respective affiliates, subject to the limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement.\nIn addition, we have contracted with State Street to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by FS Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.\nFor information regarding our expense reimbursement arrangement with FS Investments, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nPortfolio Investment Activity for the Years Ended December 31, 2017

Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.\nThe level of investment income we receive is directly related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect the dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn to increase if the size of our investment portfolio increases and the proportion of directly originated investments in our portfolio increases.\nFee income is transaction based, and typically consists of amendment and consent fees, prepayment fees, structuring fees, upfront fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, future fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees.\nExpenses\nOur operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>88,938 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>76,580 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>75,997 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated income incentive fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Administrative services expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,056 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Share transfer agent fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,757 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounting and administrative fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,405 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,703 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trustees' fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>970 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Offering costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses associated with our independent audit and related fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>552 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation of our chief compliance officer(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>686 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Printing fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,873 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,058 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Expense reimbursement from sponsor\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,260 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Expense reimbursement due to sponsor\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>132,182 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>138,093 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>152,058 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)On April 1, 2015, James F.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we offset $14,816 in management fees payable and $10,499 in subordinated income incentive fees payable by us to FS Advisor. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we accrued $5,945 for expense reimbursements that we intend to apply towards an offset in management fees payable by us to FS Advisor. Under the expense reimbursement agreement, amounts reimbursed to us by FS Investments may become subject to repayment by us in future periods. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $2,858 in expense recoupments to FS Investments or its affiliates. During\nthe years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not accrue any expense reimbursements that FS Investments has agreed to pay or pay any amounts in expense recoupments to FS Investments or its affiliates. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the expense reimbursement agreement.\nNet Investment Income\nOur net investment income totaled $286,574 ($0.65 per share), $231,647 ($0.57 per share) and $227,595 ($0.67 per share) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\nOur net realized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gain (loss) on investments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(91,083 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(251,431 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(201,559 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(210 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net realized gain (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(91,082 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(251,431 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(201,769 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)We sold investments and received principal repayments of $710,040 and $721,608, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017, $680,239 and $544,813, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $590,726 and $209,808, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nOur net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and foreign currency for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(308,513 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>772,361 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(537,036 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(89 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(308,462 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>772,368 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(537,125 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by the performance of our directly originated investments. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by a general improvement in the energy markets, a tightening of credit spreads and the performance of our anchor order and broadly syndicated investments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by a general widening of credit spreads in Energy markets and by the performance of our directly originated and opportunistic investments.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $(112,970) ($(0.26) per share), $752,584 ($1.84 per share) and $(511,299) ($(1.51) per share), respectively.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $195,376 in cash, which we or our wholly-owned financing subsidiaries held in custodial accounts, and $100,000 in borrowings available under our financing arrangements, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. To seek to enhance our returns, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS Advisor, but in no event may leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See \"-Financing Arrangements.\" As of December 31, 2017, we also had broadly syndicated investments and opportunistic investments that could be sold to create additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, we had four senior secured loan investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $90,662 and two equity/other investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $8,751. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nPublic Offering of Shares, Distribution Reinvestment Plan and Share Repurchase Program\nIn November 2016, we closed our continuous public offering of common shares to new investors. Following the closing of our continuous public offering, we will continue to issue shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nWe generate cash primarily from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan and from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See \"-Financing Arrangements.\"\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the net proceeds from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan as well as from sales and paydowns of existing investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nFor additional information regarding our continuous public offering, distribution reinvestment plan and share repurchase program, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe borrow funds to make investments to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities and our board of trustees determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders. We do not currently anticipate issuing any preferred shares.\nThe following table presents a summary of information with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Facility(1) </th> <th> </th> <th>Type of\nArrangement </th> <th> </th> <th>Rate </th> <th> </th> <th>Amount\nOutstanding </th> <th> </th> <th>Amount\nAvailable </th> <th> </th> <th>Maturity Date </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Barclays Credit Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving </td> <td> </td> <td>L+3.25% </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 18, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BNP Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Prime Brokerage </td> <td> </td> <td>L+1.35% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>September 27, 2018(2) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deutsche Bank Credit Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Revolving </td> <td> </td> <td>L+2.05% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>340,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>June 11, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fortress Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Term </td> <td> </td> <td>L+5.00%(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>November 6, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goldman Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Term </td> <td> </td> <td>L+3.72% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>425,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>September 15, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,220,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The carrying amount outstanding under the facility approximates its fair value.\n(2)The BNP facility generally is terminable upon 270 days' notice by either party.

As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each tax year, dividends generally of an amount at least equal to 90% of our \"investment company taxable income,\" which is generally the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we may, in certain cases, satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement by distributing dividends relating to a tax year after the close of such tax year under the \"spillover dividend\" provisions of Subchapter M of the Code. If we distribute a spillover dividend, such dividend will be included in a shareholder's gross income for the tax year in which the spillover distribution is paid. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our shareholders to maintain our RIC tax treatment each tax year. We will also be subject to nondeductible U.S. federal excise taxes on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner to our shareholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary taxable income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains over capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to our shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. shareholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared.\nPrior to the closing of our continuous public offering in November 2016, we declared regular cash distributions on a weekly basis, and paid such distributions on a monthly basis. Subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees, we intend to declare and pay regular cash distributions on a monthly basis. We will calculate each shareholder's specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each shareholder's distributions will begin to accrue on the date that common shares are issued to such shareholder. From time to time, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees.\nDuring certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make will represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of an investor's investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with our continuous public offering, including any fees payable to FS Advisor. Moreover, a return of capital will generally not be taxable, but will reduce each shareholder's cost basis in our common shares, and will result in a higher reported capital gain or lower reported capital loss when the common shares on which such return of capital was received are sold. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders.\nWe intend to continue to make our regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution, unless shareholders elect to receive their cash distributions in additional common shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. shareholder.\nThe following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we have declared and paid on our common shares during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Distribution </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>For the Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>Per Share </th> <th> </th> <th>Amount </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.7085 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>238,833 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.7085 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>288,982 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.7085 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>312,694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our distributions, including a reconciliation of our GAAP-basis net investment income to our tax-basis net investment income, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis and deferred taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nWe determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of trustees. In connection with that determination, FS Advisor provides our board of trustees with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party valuation services.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n\u2022 our quarterly fair valuation process begins with FS Advisor's management team reviewing and documenting preliminary valuations of each portfolio company or investment, which valuations may be obtained from an independent third-party valuation service, if applicable;\n\u2022 FS Advisor's management team then provides the valuation committee with the preliminary valuations for each portfolio company or investment;\n\u2022 preliminary valuations are then discussed with the valuation committee;\n\u2022 the valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations and FS Advisor's management team, together with our independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee;\n\u2022 following its review, the valuation committee will recommend that our board of trustees approve our fair valuations; and\n\u2022 our board of trustees discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each such investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of FS Advisor, the valuation committee and any independent third-party valuation services, if applicable.\nDetermination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, our board of trustees may use any approved independent third-party pricing or valuation services. However, our board of trustees is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information obtained from FS Advisor or any approved independent third-party valuation or pricing service that our board of trustees deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that FS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may consider when determining the fair value of our investments.\nValuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, we may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the portfolio company in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing our debt investments.\nFor convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used.\nOur equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Our board of trustees, in its determination of fair value, may consider various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon the particular circumstances of a portfolio company or our actual investment position. For example, adjustments to EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring or other related items.\nFS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair value. FS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider the\nsize and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, and may apply discounts or premiums, where and as appropriate, due to the higher (or lower) financial risk and/or the smaller size of portfolio companies relative to comparable firms, as well as such other factors as our board of trustees, in consultation with FS Advisor's management team and any approved independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, may consider relevant in assessing fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security.\nWhen we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. Our board of trustees subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value.\nThe fair values of our investments are determined in good faith by our board of trustees. Our board of trustees is solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Our board of trustees has delegated day-to-day responsibility for implementing our valuation policy to FS Advisor's management team, and has authorized FS Advisor's management team to utilize independent third-party valuation and pricing services that have been approved by our board of trustees. The valuation committee is responsible for overseeing FS Advisor's implementation of the valuation process.\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nRevenue Recognition\nSecurity transactions are accounted for on the trade date. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. We record dividend income on the ex-dividend date. We do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such income. Our policy is to place investments on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that interest income will be collected. We consider many factors relevant to an investment when placing it on or removing it from non-accrual status including, but not limited to, the delinquency status of the investment, economic and business conditions, the overall financial condition of the underlying investment, the value of the underlying collateral, bankruptcy status, if any, and any other facts or circumstances relevant to the investment. If there is reasonable doubt that we will receive any previously accrued interest, then the previously recognized interest income will be written-off. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the collectability of the remaining principal and interest. Non-accrual investments may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become current and are likely to remain current based on our judgment.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and we amortize such amounts as interest income over the respective term of the loan or security. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees and original issue discount are recorded as interest income. Structuring and other non-recurring upfront fees are recorded as fee income when earned. We record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as fee income when we earn such amounts.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides for revenue recognition based on the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. When it becomes effective, the new revenue recognition guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 will replace most revenue recognition guidance under existing GAAP. In 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance that clarified, amended and technically corrected prior revenue recognition guidance. The new revenue recognition guidance applies to all entities and all contracts with customers to provide goods or services in the ordinary course of business, excluding, among other things, financial instruments as well as certain other contractual rights and obligations. For public entities, the new standards are effective\nduring the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The standards permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. As a result, we are required to adopt the new guidance as of January 1, 2018 and expect to do so using the cumulative effect method applied to in-scope contracts with customers that have not been completed as of the date of adoption.\nIn connection with our evaluation of the impact of the new revenue recognition guidance on its revenue recognition polices for structuring and other non-recurring upfront fees, we have performed an analysis to identify contracts with customers within the scope of the new revenue recognition guidance and to determine the related performance obligation and transaction price. Under the new revenue recognition guidance, we expect to recognize revenue for in-scope contracts based on the transaction price as the performance obligation is fulfilled. In our analysis, we considered, among other matters, the nature of the performance obligation and constraints on including variable consideration in the transaction price. In addition, we considered the costs incurred to obtain and fulfill in-scope contracts with customers to determine whether such costs would be required to be capitalized. Based on our analysis, we expect to provide additional revenue recognition disclosures required under the new standard but do not otherwise expect a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses, Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation and Net Change in Unrealized Gains or Losses on Foreign Currency\nGains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method. We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized fees. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized and the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for any foreign denominated investments we may hold. Net change in unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency reflects the change in the value of foreign currency held, receivables or accruals during the reporting period due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nUncertainty in Income Taxes\nWe evaluate our tax positions to determine if the tax positions taken meet the minimum recognition threshold in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be taken for the purposes of measuring and recognizing tax benefits or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Recognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we did not incur any interest or penalties.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our significant accounting policies.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into an agreement with FS Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement are equal to (a) an annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average value of our gross assets and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. Effective January 1, 2018, FS Advisor agreed to (a) permanently waive a portion of its base management fee to which it is entitled under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, so that the fee received equals 1.75% of the average value of our gross assets (gross assets equals total assets as set forth on our consolidated balance sheets) and (b) waive incentive fees on income for a period of twelve months ending December 31, 2018. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of this agreement and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding indebtness at December 31, 2017 is as follows:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments Due By Period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Maturity Date(1) </th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1-3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>3-5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than 5\nyears </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BNP Facility(2)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>September 27, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deutsche Bank Credit Facility(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>June 11, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>340,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>340,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fortress Facility(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>November 6, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>155,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>155,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goldman Facility(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>September 15, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>425,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>425,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Amounts outstanding under the financing arrangements will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on the maturity date.\n(2)The BNP facility generally is terminable upon 270 days' notice by either party.

We commenced accruing fees under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement on July 18, 2011, upon commencement of our investment operations. Base management fees are paid on a quarterly basis in arrears. Effective January 1, 2018, FS Advisor agreed to (a) permanently waive a portion of its base management fee to which it is entitled under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, so that the fee received equals 1.75% of the average value of our gross assets (gross assets equals total assets as set forth on our consolidated balance sheets) and (b) waive incentive fees on income for a period of twelve months ending December 31, 2018.\nThe dealer manager for our continuous public offering was FS Investment Solutions, which is one of our affiliates. Under the dealer manager agreement among us, FS Advisor and FS Investment Solutions, or the dealer manager agreement, FS Investment Solutions was entitled to receive sales commissions and dealer manager fees in connection with the sale of common shares in our continuous public offering, all or a portion of which were re-allowed to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives. The dealer manager agreement terminated in connection with the closing of our continuous public offering in November 2016.\nSee Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our related party transactions and relationships, including a description of the fees and amounts due to FS Advisor, capital contributions by FS Advisor and GSO, potential conflicts of interest, our exemptive relief order, our expense reimbursement arrangement with FS Investments and FS Benefit Trust's purchases of our common shares.\nSee \"Business-The Transition of Advisory Services\" for information regarding GSO's resignation as our investment sub-advisor and our potential advisory relationship with FS/EIG Advisor.\nRecent Developments\nSee \"Item 1.

The forward-looking statements and projections contained in this annual report on Form 10-K are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.\nOverview\nWe were formed as a Delaware statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act on September 16, 2010 and formally commenced investment operations on July 18, 2011 upon raising gross proceeds in excess of $2,500 from sales of our common shares in our continuous public offering to persons who were not affiliated with us or FS Advisor. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the minimum offering requirement, we had no operations except for matters relating to our organization. In November 2016, we closed our continuous public offering of common shares to new investors.\nOur investment activities are managed by FS Advisor and supervised by our board of trustees, a majority of whom are independent. Under our investment advisory and administrative services agreement, we have agreed to pay FS Advisor an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as incentive fees based on our performance. FS Advisor engaged GSO to act as our investment sub-adviser. GSO currently assists FS Advisor in identifying investment opportunities and makes investment recommendations for approval by FS Advisor according to guidelines set by FS Advisor.\nOur investment policy is to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of our total assets in securities of Energy companies. This investment policy may not be changed without at least 60 days' prior notice to holders of our common shares of any such change.\nAs we previously announced on December 11, 2017, GSO intends to resign as our investment sub-adviser and terminate the investment sub-advisory agreement effective as of the GSO end date. In connection with GSO's resignation as our investment sub-adviser, FS Advisor and its affiliates and EIG desire to enter into a relationship whereby FS Advisor and EIG will jointly provide management, investment advisory and administrative services to us through FS/EIG Advisor. See \"-The Transition of Investment Advisory Services\" for information regarding our potential investment advisory relationship with FS/EIG Advisor.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. We have identified and intend to focus on the following investment categories, which we believe will allow us to generate an attractive total return with an acceptable level of risk.\nDirect Originations: We intend to leverage our relationships and, currently, our relationship with GSO and its global sourcing and origination platform, including its industry relationships, to directly source investment opportunities. Such investments are originated or structured for us or made by us and are not generally available to the broader market. These investments may include both debt and equity components, although we do not expect to make equity investments (other than income-oriented equity investments) independent of having an existing credit relationship. We believe directly originated investments may offer higher returns and more favorable protections than broadly syndicated transactions.\nOpportunistic: We seek to capitalize on market price inefficiencies by investing in loans, bonds and other securities where the market price of such investment reflects a lower value than deemed warranted by our fundamental analysis. We believe that market price inefficiencies may occur due to, among other things, general dislocations in the markets, a misunderstanding by the market of a particular company or an Energy industry sub-sector being out of favor with the broader investment community. We seek to allocate capital to these securities that have been misunderstood or mispriced by the market and where we believe there is an opportunity to earn an attractive return on our investment. Such opportunities may include both event driven investments and anchor orders.\nIn the case of event driven investments, we intend to take advantage of dislocations that arise in the markets due to an impending event and where the market's apparent expectation of value differs substantially from our fundamental analysis. Such events may include a looming debt maturity or default, a merger, spin-off or other corporate reorganization, an adverse regulatory or legal ruling, or a material contract expiration, any of which may significantly improve or impair a company's financial position. Compared to other investment strategies, event driven investing depends more heavily on our ability to successfully predict the outcome of an individual event rather than on underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. As a result, successful event driven strategies may offer both substantial diversification benefits and the ability to generate performance in uncertain market environments.\nWe may also invest in certain opportunities that are originated and then syndicated by a commercial or investment bank but where we provide a capital commitment significantly above the average syndicate participant, i.e., an anchor order. In these types of investments, we may receive fees, preferential pricing or other benefits not available to other lenders in return for our significant capital commitment. Our decision to provide an anchor order to a syndicated transaction is predicated on a rigorous credit analysis, our familiarity with a particular company, Energy industry sub-sector or financial sponsor, and the broader investment experiences of FS Advisor and GSO.\nBroadly Syndicated/Other: Although our primary focus is to invest in directly originated transactions and opportunistic investments, in certain circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and provide a complement to our less liquid strategies. In addition, and because we typically receive more attractive financing terms on these positions than we do on our less liquid assets, we are able to leverage the broadly syndicated portion of our portfolio in such a way that maximizes the levered return potential of our portfolio.\nOur portfolio is comprised primarily of income-oriented securities, which refers to debt securities and income-oriented preferred and common equity interests, of privately-held Energy companies within the United States. We intend to weight our portfolio towards senior and subordinated debt. In addition to investments purchased from dealers or other investors in the secondary market, we expect to invest in primary market transactions and directly originated investments as this will provide us with the ability to tailor investments to best match a project's or company's needs with our investment objectives. Our portfolio may also be comprised of select income-oriented preferred or common equity interests, which refers to equity interests that pay consistent, high-yielding dividends, that we believe will produce both current income and long-term capital appreciation. These income-oriented preferred or common equity interests may include interests in master limited partnerships. In connection with certain of our debt investments or any restructuring of these debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests, including warrants or options, as additional consideration or otherwise in connection with a restructuring.\nRevenues\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency. Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign\ndenominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investments. Net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. We also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we may hold. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of advisory fees and other expenses under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other expenses necessary for our operations. Our investment advisory fee compensates FS Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. FS Advisor is responsible for compensating our investment sub-adviser.\nWe reimburse FS Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FS Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments providing administrative services to us on behalf of FS Advisor. Such services include the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. FS Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FS Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.\nThe amount of the reimbursement payable to FS Advisor is set at the lesser of (1) FS Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that we estimate we would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS Advisor is required to allocate the cost of such services to us based on factors such as assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. Our board of trustees reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of the administrative expenses among us and certain affiliates of FS Advisor. Our board of trustees then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of trustees considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of trustees, among other things, compares the total amount paid to FS Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse FS Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FS Advisor.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\n\u2022 corporate and organization expenses relating to offerings of our common shares, subject to limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement;\n\u2022 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party pricing or valuation services;\n\u2022 the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of our common shares and other securities;\n\u2022 investment advisory fees;\n\u2022 fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n\u2022 interest payments on our debt or related obligations;\n\u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees;\n\u2022 research and market data (including news and quotation equipment and services, and any computer hardware and connectivity hardware (e.g. telephone and fiber optic lines) incorporated into the cost of obtaining such research and market data);\n\u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n\u2022 federal and state registration fees;\n\u2022 federal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022 annual fees of the Delaware trustee;\n\u2022 fees and expenses of our trustees not also serving in an executive officer capacity for us or FS Advisor;\n\u2022 costs of proxy statements, shareholders' reports and notices and other filings;\n\u2022 our fidelity bond, trustees and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n\u2022 direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n\u2022 fees and expenses associated with accounting, corporate governance, government and regulatory affairs activities, independent audits and outside legal costs;\n\u2022 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022 brokerage commissions for our investments;\n\u2022 costs associated with our chief compliance officer; and\n\u2022 all other expenses incurred by FS Advisor, GSO or us in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by FS Advisor or GSO in performing administrative services for us and administrative personnel paid by FS Advisor or GSO, to the extent they are not controlling persons of FS Advisor, GSO or any of their respective affiliates, subject to the limitations included in the investment advisory and administrative services agreement.\nIn addition, we have contracted with State Street to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by FS Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.\nFor information regarding our expense reimbursement arrangement with FS Investments, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nPortfolio Investment Activity for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nTotal Portfolio Activity\nThe following tables present certain selected information regarding our portfolio investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\n(1)Amortized cost represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and/or accretion of discounts, as applicable, on investments.\nThe following table presents certain selected information regarding the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nBased on our regular monthly cash distribution rate of $0.059042 per share as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the price at which we issued shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan of $6.70 and $7.70, respectively, per share, the annualized distribution rate to shareholders as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 10.57% and 9.20%, respectively. The distribution rate to shareholders may include income, realized capital gains and a return of investors' capital. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our total return was (3.65)% and 29.53%, respectively, and our total return without assuming reinvestment of distributions was (3.29)% and 28.00%, respectively. On January 2, 2018, our board of trustees reduced the regular monthly cash distribution amount to $0.041667 per share to be paid to shareholders of record for January 2018 through March 2018. Based on a distribution amount of $0.041667 per share, and the price at which we last issued shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan of $6.70 per share, the annualized distribution rate to shareholders as of February 28, 2018 was 7.46%.\nOur estimated gross portfolio yield and annualized distribution rate to shareholders do not represent actual investment returns to shareholders. Our gross annual portfolio yield and distribution rate to shareholders are subject to change and in the future may be greater or less than the rates set forth above. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. See footnote 6 to the financial highlights table included in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for information regarding the calculations of our total returns.\nDirect Originations\nThe following tables present certain selected information regarding our direct originations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017:\n\n\n\nThe following table presents certain selected information regarding our direct originations as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nPortfolio Composition by Strategy\nThe table below summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio by strategy and enumerates the percentage, by fair value, of the total portfolio assets in such strategies as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nSee Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the composition of our investment portfolio by industry classification.\nPortfolio Asset Quality\nIn addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, FS Advisor uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. FS Advisor uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:\n\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nThe amount of the portfolio in each grading category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of the portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the grade of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nRevenues\nOur investment income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:\n\n(1)Such revenues represent $366,567, $315,889 and $343,792 of cash income earned as well as $52,189, $53,851 and $35,861 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount, PIK interest and accrual of limited partnership income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.\nThe level of investment income we receive is directly related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect the dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn to increase if the size of our investment portfolio increases and the proportion of directly originated investments in our portfolio increases.\nFee income is transaction based, and typically consists of amendment and consent fees, prepayment fees, structuring fees, upfront fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, future fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees.\nExpenses\nOur operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\n(1)On April 1, 2015, James F. Volk was appointed as our chief compliance officer. Prior to that date, we had contracted with Vigilant Compliance, LLC to provide the services of Salvatore Faia as our chief compliance officer. Mr. Volk is employed by FS Investments and will not receive any direct compensation from us in this capacity.\n\n(1)Ratio may be rounded in order to recompute the ending ratio of net operating expenses, excluding certain expenses, to average net assets.\nIncentive fees and interest expense, among other things, may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on portfolio performance and changes in benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR, among other factors.\nExpense Reimbursement\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we accrued $31,260 for expense reimbursements that FS Investments has agreed to pay. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we offset $14,816 in management fees payable and $10,499 in subordinated income incentive fees payable by us to FS Advisor. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we accrued $5,945 for expense reimbursements that we intend to apply towards an offset in management fees payable by us to FS Advisor. Under the expense reimbursement agreement, amounts reimbursed to us by FS Investments may become subject to repayment by us in future periods. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $2,858 in expense recoupments to FS Investments or its affiliates. During\nthe years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not accrue any expense reimbursements that FS Investments has agreed to pay or pay any amounts in expense recoupments to FS Investments or its affiliates. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the expense reimbursement agreement.\nNet Investment Income\nOur net investment income totaled $286,574 ($0.65 per share), $231,647 ($0.57 per share) and $227,595 ($0.67 per share) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\nOur net realized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\n(1)We sold investments and received principal repayments of $710,040 and $721,608, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017, $680,239 and $544,813, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $590,726 and $209,808, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nOur net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and foreign currency for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by the performance of our directly originated investments. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by a general improvement in the energy markets, a tightening of credit spreads and the performance of our anchor order and broadly syndicated investments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investments was primarily driven by a general widening of credit spreads in Energy markets and by the performance of our directly originated and opportunistic investments.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $(112,970) ($(0.26) per share), $752,584 ($1.84 per share) and $(511,299) ($(1.51) per share), respectively.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $195,376 in cash, which we or our wholly-owned financing subsidiaries held in custodial accounts, and $100,000 in borrowings available under our financing arrangements, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. To seek to enhance our returns, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS Advisor, but in no event may leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See \"-Financing Arrangements.\" As of December 31, 2017, we also had broadly syndicated investments and opportunistic investments that could be sold to create additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, we had four senior secured loan investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $90,662 and two equity/other investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $8,751. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nPublic Offering of Shares, Distribution Reinvestment Plan and Share Repurchase Program\nIn November 2016, we closed our continuous public offering of common shares to new investors. Following the closing of our continuous public offering, we will continue to issue shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nWe generate cash primarily from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan and from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See \"-Financing Arrangements.\"\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the net proceeds from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan as well as from sales and paydowns of existing investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nFor additional information regarding our continuous public offering, distribution reinvestment plan and share repurchase program, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe borrow funds to make investments to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities and our board of trustees determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders. We do not currently anticipate issuing any preferred shares.\nThe following table presents a summary of information with respect to our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2017:\n\n(1)The carrying amount outstanding under the facility approximates its fair value.\n(2)The BNP facility generally is terminable upon 270 days' notice by either party. As of December 31, 2017, neither Berwyn Funding nor BNP had provided notice of its intent to terminate the facility.\n(3)As described in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, borrowings under the Fortress facility accrue interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 5.00%, subject to a floor of 0.75%.\nFor additional information regarding our financing arrangements, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRIC Tax Treatment and Distributions\nWe have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each tax year, dividends generally of an amount at least equal to 90% of our \"investment company taxable income,\" which is generally the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we may, in certain cases, satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement by distributing dividends relating to a tax year after the close of such tax year under the \"spillover dividend\" provisions of Subchapter M of the Code. If we distribute a spillover dividend, such dividend will be included in a shareholder's gross income for the tax year in which the spillover distribution is paid. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our shareholders to maintain our RIC tax treatment each tax year. We will also be subject to nondeductible U.S. federal excise taxes on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner to our shareholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary taxable income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains over capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to our shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. shareholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared.\nPrior to the closing of our continuous public offering in November 2016, we declared regular cash distributions on a weekly basis, and paid such distributions on a monthly basis. Subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees, we intend to declare and pay regular cash distributions on a monthly basis. We will calculate each shareholder's specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each shareholder's distributions will begin to accrue on the date that common shares are issued to such shareholder. From time to time, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees.\nDuring certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make will represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of an investor's investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with our continuous public offering, including any fees payable to FS Advisor. Moreover, a return of capital will generally not be taxable, but will reduce each shareholder's cost basis in our common shares, and will result in a higher reported capital gain or lower reported capital loss when the common shares on which such return of capital was received are sold. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders.\nWe intend to continue to make our regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution, unless shareholders elect to receive their cash distributions in additional common shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. shareholder.\nThe following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we have declared and paid on our common shares during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our distributions, including a reconciliation of our GAAP-basis net investment income to our tax-basis net investment income, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis and deferred taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nWe determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of trustees. In connection with that determination, FS Advisor provides our board of trustees with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party valuation services.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n\u2022 our quarterly fair valuation process begins with FS Advisor's management team reviewing and documenting preliminary valuations of each portfolio company or investment, which valuations may be obtained from an independent third-party valuation service, if applicable;\n\u2022 FS Advisor's management team then provides the valuation committee with the preliminary valuations for each portfolio company or investment;\n\u2022 preliminary valuations are then discussed with the valuation committee;\n\u2022 the valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations and FS Advisor's management team, together with our independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee;\n\u2022 following its review, the valuation committee will recommend that our board of trustees approve our fair valuations; and\n\u2022 our board of trustees discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each such investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of FS Advisor, the valuation committee and any independent third-party valuation services, if applicable.\nDetermination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, our board of trustees may use any approved independent third-party pricing or valuation services. However, our board of trustees is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information obtained from FS Advisor or any approved independent third-party valuation or pricing service that our board of trustees deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that FS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may consider when determining the fair value of our investments.\nValuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, we may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the portfolio company in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing our debt investments.\nFor convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used.\nOur equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Our board of trustees, in its determination of fair value, may consider various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value or liquidation value. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon the particular circumstances of a portfolio company or our actual investment position. For example, adjustments to EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring or other related items.\nFS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair value. FS Advisor's management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of trustees may also consider the\nsize and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, and may apply discounts or premiums, where and as appropriate, due to the higher (or lower) financial risk and/or the smaller size of portfolio companies relative to comparable firms, as well as such other factors as our board of trustees, in consultation with FS Advisor's management team and any approved independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, may consider relevant in assessing fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security.\nWhen we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. Our board of trustees subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value.\nThe fair values of our investments are determined in good faith by our board of trustees. Our board of trustees is solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Our board of trustees has delegated day-to-day responsibility for implementing our valuation policy to FS Advisor's management team, and has authorized FS Advisor's management team to utilize independent third-party valuation and pricing services that have been approved by our board of trustees. The valuation committee is responsible for overseeing FS Advisor's implementation of the valuation process.\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nRevenue Recognition\nSecurity transactions are accounted for on the trade date. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. We record dividend income on the ex-dividend date. We do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such income. Our policy is to place investments on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that interest income will be collected. We consider many factors relevant to an investment when placing it on or removing it from non-accrual status including, but not limited to, the delinquency status of the investment, economic and business conditions, the overall financial condition of the underlying investment, the value of the underlying collateral, bankruptcy status, if any, and any other facts or circumstances relevant to the investment. If there is reasonable doubt that we will receive any previously accrued interest, then the previously recognized interest income will be written-off. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the collectability of the remaining principal and interest. Non-accrual investments may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become current and are likely to remain current based on our judgment.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and we amortize such amounts as interest income over the respective term of the loan or security. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees and original issue discount are recorded as interest income. Structuring and other non-recurring upfront fees are recorded as fee income when earned. We record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as fee income when we earn such amounts.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides for revenue recognition based on the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. When it becomes effective, the new revenue recognition guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 will replace most revenue recognition guidance under existing GAAP. In 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance that clarified, amended and technically corrected prior revenue recognition guidance. The new revenue recognition guidance applies to all entities and all contracts with customers to provide goods or services in the ordinary course of business, excluding, among other things, financial instruments as well as certain other contractual rights and obligations. For public entities, the new standards are effective\nduring the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The standards permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. As a result, we are required to adopt the new guidance as of January 1, 2018 and expect to do so using the cumulative effect method applied to in-scope contracts with customers that have not been completed as of the date of adoption.\nIn connection with our evaluation of the impact of the new revenue recognition guidance on its revenue recognition polices for structuring and other non-recurring upfront fees, we have performed an analysis to identify contracts with customers within the scope of the new revenue recognition guidance and to determine the related performance obligation and transaction price. Under the new revenue recognition guidance, we expect to recognize revenue for in-scope contracts based on the transaction price as the performance obligation is fulfilled. In our analysis, we considered, among other matters, the nature of the performance obligation and constraints on including variable consideration in the transaction price. In addition, we considered the costs incurred to obtain and fulfill in-scope contracts with customers to determine whether such costs would be required to be capitalized. Based on our analysis, we expect to provide additional revenue recognition disclosures required under the new standard but do not otherwise expect a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses, Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation and Net Change in Unrealized Gains or Losses on Foreign Currency\nGains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method. We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized fees. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized and the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for any foreign denominated investments we may hold. Net change in unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency reflects the change in the value of foreign currency held, receivables or accruals during the reporting period due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nUncertainty in Income Taxes\nWe evaluate our tax positions to determine if the tax positions taken meet the minimum recognition threshold in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be taken for the purposes of measuring and recognizing tax benefits or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Recognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we did not incur any interest or penalties.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our significant accounting policies.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into an agreement with FS Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement are equal to (a) an annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average value of our gross assets and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. Effective January 1, 2018, FS Advisor agreed to (a) permanently waive a portion of its base management fee to which it is entitled under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, so that the fee received equals 1.75% of the average value of our gross assets (gross assets equals total assets as set forth on our consolidated balance sheets) and (b) waive incentive fees on income for a period of twelve months ending December 31, 2018. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of this agreement and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding indebtness at December 31, 2017 is as follows:\n\n(1)Amounts outstanding under the financing arrangements will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on the maturity date.\n(2)The BNP facility generally is terminable upon 270 days' notice by either party. As of December 31, 2017, neither Berwyn Funding nor BNP had provided notice of its intent to terminate the facility.\n(3)At December 31, 2017, no amounts remained unused under the financing arrangement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under the Barclays credit facility. All borrowed amounts under the facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on May 18, 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices.\nRelated Party Transactions\nCompensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer Manager\nPursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FS Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. We commenced accruing fees under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement on July 18, 2011, upon commencement of our investment operations. Base management fees are paid on a quarterly basis in arrears. Effective January 1, 2018, FS Advisor agreed to (a) permanently waive a portion of its base management fee to which it is entitled under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, so that the fee received equals 1.75% of the average value of our gross assets (gross assets equals total assets as set forth on our consolidated balance sheets) and (b) waive incentive fees on income for a period of twelve months ending December 31, 2018.\nThe dealer manager for our continuous public offering was FS Investment Solutions, which is one of our affiliates. Under the dealer manager agreement among us, FS Advisor and FS Investment Solutions, or the dealer manager agreement, FS Investment Solutions was entitled to receive sales commissions and dealer manager fees in connection with the sale of common shares in our continuous public offering, all or a portion of which were re-allowed to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives. The dealer manager agreement terminated in connection with the closing of our continuous public offering in November 2016.\nSee Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our related party transactions and relationships, including a description of the fees and amounts due to FS Advisor, capital contributions by FS Advisor and GSO, potential conflicts of interest, our exemptive relief order, our expense reimbursement arrangement with FS Investments and FS Benefit Trust's purchases of our common shares.\nSee \"Business-The Transition of Advisory Services\" for information regarding GSO's resignation as our investment sub-advisor and our potential advisory relationship with FS/EIG Advisor.\nRecent Developments\nSee \"Item 1. Business-The Transition of Investment Advisory Services\" for information regarding our potential investment advisory relationship with FS/EIG Advisor.\nWaiver of Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee\nEffective January 1, 2018, FS Advisor agreed to (a) permanently waive a portion of its base management fee to which it is entitled under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, so that the fee received equals 1.75% of the average value of our gross assets and (b) waive incentive fees on income for a period of twelve months ending December 31, 2018.",

"summary": "This report, known as Item 7 on the MD&A section of Form 10-K, provides a detailed discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company in question. The report is formatted in thousands except for share and per share amounts and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\n\nThe report includes forward-looking statements relating to future events, performance, or financial condition of the company, such as future operating results, business prospects, the impact of investments, the ability of portfolio companies to achieve objectives, current and expected financing arrangements, changes in interest rates, adequacy of cash resources, and cash flow from portfolio companies.\n\nOther forward-looking concerns include contractual arrangements with third parties, conflicts of interest with funds and their advisers, general economy impacts on investment industries, the use of financial leverage, the ability to maintain RIC and BDC status, the impact of regulatory changes including the Dodd-Frank Act, tax legislation changes, and the tax status of enterprises the company invests in. The document uses words like \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" and \"intend\" to indicate forward-looking statements, but acknowledges that these statements involve risks and uncertainties and that actual results could materially differ.\n\nThe MD&A overview mentions that the company was formed as a Delaware statutory trust in 2010, began investment operations in 2011, and completed a public offering of shares in 2016. Managed by FS Advisor, the company's investment policy focuses on at least 80% of total assets invested in securities of Energy companies. In late 2017, GSO announced intentions to resign as the investment sub-adviser, with FS Advisor and EIG set to provide joint management and advisory services.\n\nInvestment activities aim to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation through direct originations leveraging GSO's global sourcing platform. Opportunistic investments aim to capitalize on market price inefficiencies, investing where market prices are lower than the fundamental analysis suggests. Broadly syndicated and other investments are also part of the investment strategy, typically carried by more liquid and leveraged portions of the portfolio.\n\nThe portfolio primarily consists of income-oriented securities in private Energy companies in the US. Senior and subordinated debt are the primary focus, supplemented with equity interests including master limited partnerships. The report explains revenue generation and expenses, with fees associated with making and valuing investments detailed.\n\nThe MD&A section covers portfolio investment activity comparing 2017 and 2016, providing data on net investment activity and new investment activity by asset class. Tables display this information, alongside a table summarizing the portfolio composition at cost and fair value as of 2017 and 2016, the composition of the investment portfolio, and the direct originations for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n\nThe discussion on revenues and expenses indicates a measure of financial performance, net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations. The sources include interest income from debt investments and dividends/distributions from equity securities, along with commitment, origination, structuring, consulting, and performance-based fees.\n\nOperating expenses include advisory fees, administrative service reimbursements, interest on debts, legal fees, trustee fees, and other costs related to corporate administration, regulatory compliance, and business operations.\n\nThe year-end performance, distribution rates, and investment yields, both gross and net, are discussed. The impact of the 10-K information is clarified as not providing actual investment returns and is subject to change and risks detailed in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\n\nLastly, the report provides tables and explanations for portfolio investment activities and direct originations, detailing total commitments and exited investments for the year and specific quarters.\n\nThe report also includes information on financial condition, liquidity, capital resources, offered shares, distribution reinvestment plan, share repurchase program, and financing arrangements. The tax implications of the company\u2019s status as a RIC are discussed, and important accounting policies and related party transactions are outlined.\n\nOverall, the MD&A report provides a comprehensive analysis of the company\u2019s financial situation, results of operations, and projections for future performance, albeit with the caution that actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to uncertainties and other factors."}
