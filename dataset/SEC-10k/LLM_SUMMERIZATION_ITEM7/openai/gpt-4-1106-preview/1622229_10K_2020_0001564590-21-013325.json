Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases. Our approach is to design rational precision therapies that treat the underlying cause of disease and improve the lives of patients. Our most advanced program is CGT9486, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to potently inhibit the KIT D816V mutation as well as other mutations in KIT exon 17. In the vast majority of cases, KIT D816V is responsible for driving SM, a serious disease caused by unchecked proliferation of mast cells. Exon 17 mutations are also found in patients with advanced GIST, a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. CGT9486 is a highly selective and potent KIT inhibitor with the potential to provide a new treatment option for these patient populations.\nOn July 6, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Kiq, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. On October 2, 2020, we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to change our name from Unum Therapeutics Inc. to Cogent Biosciences, Inc. The name change became effective on October 6, 2020. In connection with the name change, our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol COGT.\u201d\nCGT9486 has been administered to more than 50 advanced solid tumor and GIST patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, with the vast majority of those patients living with advanced GIST. GIST is a disease frequently driven by KIT mutations, and resistance to currently available therapeutics is frequently associated with the emergence of other KIT mutations. Anti-tumor activity for CGT9486 was observed in both single agent and combination settings, including in combination with sunitinib, an approved treatment option for GIST patients. Clinical data from this trial have been presented at several scientific conferences, including most recently by Cogent at the 2020 annual CTOS meeting, and previously by Plexxikon, a member of the Daiichi Sankyo Group, at the 2018 annual ASCO meeting and the 2017 annual CTOS meeting. Within the group of 15 heavily pre-treated GIST patients who received the combination of CGT9486 and sunitinib, and who had not received prior treatment with CGT9486, the confirmed ORR was twenty percent, including two partial responses and one complete response, while the estimated mPFS for this group was twelve months. Four subjects continued to receive CGT9486 via individual patient INDs beyond the conclusion of the trial.\nBased on these results, we are planning an FDA interaction to explore further clinical development of CGT9486 in combination with sunitinib in GIST patients, and plan to initiate an additional clinical study in GIST in the second half of 2021.\nIn addition to continuing the development of CGT9486 in GIST patients, we are pursuing development of the compound in patients living with AdvSM and Non-AdvSM. The vast majority of AdvSM and Non-AdvSM patients have a KIT D816V mutation. Patients with AdvSM have a significantly diminished lifespan with a median survival of less than 3.5 years. For patients with Non-AdvSM, there are no available approved therapies, and while their lifespan is not impacted by the disease, these patients suffer from a poor quality of life and new treatment options are badly needed. Emerging clinical data for other kinase inhibitors with activity against KIT D816V have shown that the disease is highly sensitive to inhibition of the target. CGT9486 was specifically designed to selectively inhibit KIT mutations on exon 17, including KIT D816V, and we aim to expand the clinical development of this program to treat systemic mastocytosis patients.\nSubject to feedback from regulatory authorities, we expect to initiate clinical trials in AdvSM patients in the first half of 2021, followed by trials in Non-AdvSM patients in the second half of 2021. We expect to rapidly assess CGT9486 activity in mastocytosis patients by monitoring levels of serum tryptase, a relevant biomarker of disease activity which is elevated in these patients.\nWorldwide rights to develop and commercialize CGT9486, as well as an additional selective KIT inhibitor, CGT0206, were exclusively licensed by Kiq from Plexxikon. Under the terms of the License Agreement, Plexxikon received an upfront payment and is eligible for additional development milestones and mid- to high- single-digit royalty payments.\nPatents protecting CGT9486 include composition of matter claims which have issued in the US and other key territories and provide exclusivity through 2033 and potentially beyond through patent term extensions.\nIn addition to our small molecule efforts, we have developed proprietary technologies which enable cell therapy programs targeting cancers utilizing a patient's engineered T cells. Our ACTR (Antibody-Coupled T cell Receptor) product candidates incorporate a novel chimeric receptor that are designed to enable a co-administered, tumor-specific antibody to direct T cell targeting toward tumor cells. All ACTR clinical trials are closed to further enrollment. We have completed all closeout activities for 3 of 4 ACTR clinical trials as of December 31, 2020 and we anticipate closing out the last ACTR clinical trial in the first half of 2021.\nOn August 28, 2020, we completed the sale of our BOXR Platform, to Sotio, pursuant to the terms of the BOXR Platform Purchase Agreement.\nPursuant to the BOXR Platform Purchase Agreement, Sotio has agreed to pay us total cash consideration of up to $11.5 million, consisting of an upfront payment of $8.1 million ($1.73 million of which was placed in escrow for 90 days for general representations and warranties) and potential milestone payments of up to $3.4 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the issuance of specified claims (as described in the BOXR Platform Purchase Agreement) by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the European Patent Office. The $1.73 million held in escrow was released and received by the Company on November 30, 2020.\nSince our inception in 2014, we have focused significant efforts and financial resources on establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development of our product candidates, manufacturing drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials, staffing our company, and raising capital. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of preferred stock, our public offerings of our common stock, private placements and payments received under our Collaboration Agreement with Seagen.\nOn March 19, 2020, we entered into the LPC Purchase Agreement with LPC, pursuant to which we may elect to sell to LPC up to $25.0 million in shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the LPC Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the LPC Purchase Agreement, we issued 181,595 shares of common stock to LPC as a commitment fee. As of December 31, 2020, 2,412,870 registered common shares have been sold to LPC under the LPC Purchase Agreement for proceeds of $25.0 million. No additional shares may be sold to LPC under the LPC Purchase Agreement.\nOn March 26, 2020, we announced that we would be exploring strategic alternatives in order to maximize stockholder value and that we had engaged Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. to act as our strategic financial advisor to assist in the strategic review process. As of July 6, 2020, we successfully signed and closed the acquisition of Kiq.\nOn July 6, 2020, we issued a contingent value right (CVR), which was distributed to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 6, 2020, and prior to the issuance of any shares to acquire Kiq or sold to the PIPE investors. In November 2020, in partial settlement of the CVR obligation, we issued 707,938 shares of common stock. In February 2021, we issued an additional 212,428 shares of common stock and paid $0.1 million in partial settlement of the CVR obligation.\nOn July 9, 2020, we completed a PIPE with existing and new investors to raise gross proceeds of $104.4 million, or net proceeds of $98.9 million after deducting commissions and offering costs, in which the investors were issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $880 per share or, $3.52 per share on an as-converted-to-common basis.\nIn August 2020, our board of directors unanimously approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation, which would allow the board to effect a reverse stock split of all issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, at a ratio ranging from 1-for-4 to 1-for-8, inclusive, subject to stockholder approval. On October 9, 2020, we filed a Definitive Proxy Statement which included the proposal that our stockholders approve the amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect the reverse stock split and a proposal that the stockholders approve the conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred\nStock issued in the Kiq acquisition and the PIPE. The proposals were approved by the stockholders at a special meeting held on November 6, 2020 and our board of directors approved a ratio of 1-for-4 for the reverse stock split. The amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-4 was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on November 6, 2020. All disclosures of common shares, per common share data and preferred stock conversion ratios have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, but not any conversion of Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn December 4, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,794,872 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.75 per share. This included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 1,538,461 additional shares of common stock. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $107.7 million.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net loss was $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net loss of $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $198.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue additional clinical trials for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> hire additional clinical, scientific, and commercial personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> establish manufacturing capabilities in-house;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> establish a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> establish sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts, as well as to support our transition to a public reporting company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, and distribution.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $242.2 million. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and worldwide. We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19. We are monitoring the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and have taken steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a work-from-home policy for all employees who are able to perform their duties remotely and restricting all nonessential travel, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, the patients we serve and other business partners in light of COVID-19. Given the fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic however, we do not yet know the full extent of the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, among others. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which our business, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We will continue to work diligently with our partners and stakeholders to continue advancing our product candidate under regulatory review as well as in our clinical studies to the extent safe to do so for patients, caregivers and healthcare practitioners, and ensuring the continuity of our manufacturing and supply chain. For additional information related to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, please read Part I-Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or additional license or collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from additional collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties. Our revenue for the next several years, if any, will be derived primarily from any collaborations that we may enter into in the future.\nIn June 2015, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Seagen. Pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Seagen agreed to jointly develop two product candidates incorporating our ACTR platform and Seagen's antibodies. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we conducted preclinical research and clinical development activities related to the two specified product candidates through Phase 1 clinical development, and Seagen provided the funding for those activities. As a result of the Collaboration Agreement with Seagen, we recognized revenue of $7.9 million and $22.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the upfront payment received from Seagen under our Collaboration Agreement as well as reimbursements of research and development costs.\nOn January 16, 2020 (the Termination Date), we and Seagen announced an agreement to terminate the ATTCK-17-01 Phase 1 clinical trial and other research activities under the collaboration (the Termination Agreement). Pursuant to terms of the Termination Agreement, among other things, (i) Seagen paid us $5.75 million, (ii) Seagen surrendered, assigned and transferred to us all of its right, title and interest in the 207,961 shares of our common stock owned by Seagen, (iii) we will continue to be responsible for and pay all expenses for the wind-down of the ACTR-BCMA trial and (iv) Seagen paid all research and development costs incurred through the Termination Effective Date. In addition, the exclusivity provisions in the Collaboration Agreement terminate and each party will be free to research, develop and commercialize their individual intellectual property (either by themselves or with third parties, subject to the intellectual property rights of the other party.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contractors and CROs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contractors and CMOs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> laboratory supplies and animal care;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> payments made under third-party licensing agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur research and development costs include costs for the development of product candidates that were developed with Seagen and for which we have received reimbursement as specified in our Collaboration Agreement. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs, and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical and preclinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered, or may enter, into collaboration arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the success in establishing and operating a manufacturing facility, or securing manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> competition with other products; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting, and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as of a result of the costs associated with the expansion of operations subsequent to the acquisition CGT9486.\nAcquired In-process Research and Development (IPR&D)\nWe expense acquired IPR&D in connection with an asset acquisition when there is no alternative future use, as determined by Management in accordance with GAAP.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents balances. Our interest income has not been significant due to low interest earned on invested balances.\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets consists of the gain recorded on the disposal of long-lived assets, including the BOXR platform related assets and other equipment.\nOther Income\nOther income consists of miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations, primarily income from subleasing a portion of our headquarters facilities.\nChange in fair value of the CVR liability\nThis consists of changes in the fair value of the CVR liability.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any current or deferred tax benefit for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our research and development tax credits generated, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020. We reevaluate the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits at each reporting period. As of December 31, 2020, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $63.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2035. As of December 31, 2020, we also had\nU.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2040 and 2035, respectively.\nUtilization of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period.\nAs a result of the shares issued in July 2020 related to the acquisition of Kiq and the sale of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company has experienced a change in ownership, as defined by Section 382. As a result of the ownership change, utilization of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitation under Section 382. Under Section 382, the annual limitation is determined by first multiplying the value of the Company's stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. This limitation resulted in the expiration of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards before utilization of $26.9 million and $79.5 million, respectively, and federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization of $6.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. We have written off these gross deferred tax attributes, which were previously fully reserved for, in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $59.4 million and $3.9 million of federal and state net operating losses, respectively, as well as $14.2 million of future amortization for federal purposes, are subject to the July 6 limitation of $0.3 million per year. A second ownership change occurred in December 2020 as a result of the underwritten public offering of common stock which resulted in a limitation of tax attributes generated from July 7, 2020 to December 1, 2020. The December 1, 2020 ownership change is not expected to have a material impact to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards as these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be utilized, subject to annual limitation, assuming sufficient taxable income is generated before expiration.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquired in-process research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (82,199\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32,178\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposal of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of CVR liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,025\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (74,808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,833\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $7.9 million and $22.5 million, respectively. We recognize revenue from the upfront payment we received as well as ongoing reimbursements of research and development costs from Seagen by applying the costs-to-cost method over the performance period.\nCollaboration revenue fluctuates based upon our pattern of performance for each performance obligation and changes in estimated transaction price and costs to complete our performance obligations.\nOn January 16, 2020, Cogent and Seagen announced an agreement to terminate the ATTCK-17-01 Phase 1 clinical trial and other research activities under the collaboration. Pursuant to terms of the Termination Agreement, among other things, (i) Seagen paid Cogent $5.75 million and (ii) Seagen surrendered, assigned and transferred to Cogent all of its right, title and interest in the 207,961 shares of Cogent's common stock owned by Seagen.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, in considering all facts known, including the suspension of the ATTCK-17-01 clinical trial as announced in November 2019 and the expected termination of the Collaboration Agreement in January 2020, we adjusted the estimated transaction price to be the $25.0 million upfront payment from 2015 and the total payments to be earned for preclinical research and clinical development activities through the Termination Date. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we adjusted the transaction price to include the termination payment of $5.75 million as well as the aggregate fair value of $0.8 million as of January 16, 2020 of the 207,961 shares of common stock received. We also adjusted the costs to complete the remaining performance obligations to represent our best estimate as of December 31, 2020. Revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the termination payments previously discussed.\nAll performance obligations under the Collaboration Agreement are complete as of December 31, 2020 and all revenue has been recognized under the Collaboration Agreement. There is no remaining deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is driven by the conclusion of our legacy cell therapy clinical efforts and a reduction in force that resulted in the termination of approximately 60% of the Company's employee workforce, or 43 employees, in March 2020. These decreases are offset by the development of CGT9486, stock compensation expense charges of $1.4 million resulting from the acceleration of vesting linked to the Kiq acquisition and a $2.0 million reversal from a change in estimated costs associated with our legacy cell therapy clinical trials.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $17.4 million, compared to $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses was driven by increased personnel costs of $4.4 million, which includes stock compensation expense charges of $1.4 million resulting from the acceleration of vesting linked to the Kiq acquisition. Professional, consultant and other fees have increased $2.0 million as a result of the various transactions occurring during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAcquired In-process Research and Development (IPR&D)\nWe expensed acquired IPR&D, with an estimated fair value of $46.9 million, including $2.1 million of associated transaction costs, in connection with the Kiq asset acquisition as there was no alternative future use, as determined by Management in accordance with GAAP.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.1 million, compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income decreased due to lower average invested balances and lower interest rates in the current year compared to the prior period.\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets, net was $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $7.4 million change represents the net proceeds of the sale of the BOXR Platform as well as the proceeds from the sale of other long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther Income\nOther income, net was $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Other income represents sublease income recognized resulting from the sublease of a portion of our leased office space. No sublease income was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nChange in fair value of CVR liability\nChange in fair value of CVR liability for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents the change in the fair value of the CVR liability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred certain costs related to the COVID-19 outbreak as a result of taking necessary precautions for essential personnel to operate safely both in person as well as remotely. Costs incurred include items like incremental payroll costs, consulting support, IT infrastructure and facilities related costs. The estimated impact of COVID-19 is currently unknown. The final impact may vary based on the duration of the current social and economic conditions. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations in the future. We do not currently believe the accumulated costs will present a material impact to our financial liquidity or position.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have generated limited revenue to date from funding arrangements with our collaboration partner. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. We have historically funded our operations primarily through the public offering and private placement of our securities and consideration received from our collaborative agreements. See Funding Requirements\u201d and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our liquidity and capital resources.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2,412,870 shares have been sold under the LPC Purchase Agreement for proceeds of $25.0 million. No additional shares may be sold to LPC under the terms of the LPC Purchase Agreement.\nOn July 9, 2020, we completed a PIPE and issued 118,638 Series A Preferred Stock to new and existing investors in exchange gross proceeds of $104.4 million, or net proceeds of $98.9 million, after deducting commissions and estimated offering costs.\nOn December 4, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,794,872 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.75 per share (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 1,538,461 additional shares of common stock), or net proceeds from the offering of $107.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $242.2 million, which we expect will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024.\nThe Company expects that it will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with its ongoing business activities. The Company will need to seek additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements, partnerships, joint ventures, combinations or divestitures of one or more of its businesses. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into collaborative arrangements or divest its assets. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company's stockholders. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies or product candidates. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs or\ncommercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (35,850\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (41,514\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 232,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 204,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (18,247\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $35.9 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $74.8 million and from net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $5.3 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $44.3 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of a $4.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a $1.3 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $1.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $0.8 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $0.7 million decrease in the right-of-use asset, and a $0.4 million decrease in other assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $41.5 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $31.8 million and from net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $14.1 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $4.4 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of a $16.6 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $0.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $0.4 million increase in other assets, all partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nChanges in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in all periods were generally due to changes in our business, the advancement of our product candidates, and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by investing activities was $8.4 million, which consisted of $8.1 million in proceeds from the disposal of the BOXR Platform as well as $0.3 million in proceeds from the sale of other property and equipment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by investing activities was $23.2 million, which consisted of net purchases of maturities and sale of marketable securities of $23.0 million and $0.2 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of $0.1 million.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $232.2 million which consisted of $107.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in underwritten public offering, net of issuance costs, $98.9 million in proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock and common stock, net of issuance costs, $25.0 million from the issuance of common stock to LPC, $0.5 million from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises, and $0.1 million from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.1 million from the proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance clinical development of our product candidates, preclinical activities, and wind-down our legacy clinical trials. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the initiation, progress, timing, and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future potential product candidates, including the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing and planned research and development efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> any delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority's review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA's issuance of a refusal to file\u201d letter or a request for additional information;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adverse results or delays in clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial, or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adverse developments concerning our manufacturers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our inability to establish collaborations if needed;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our failure to commercialize our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the impact of COVID-19 on the operations of key governmental agencies, such as the FDA, which may delay the development of our current product candidates or any future product candidates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of $242.2 million as of December 31, 2020 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining benefits from cost saving measures implemented or planned or in obtaining additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all, nor is it considered probable under the accounting standards. As such, under the requirements of ASC 205-40, management may not consider the potential for future capital raises or management plans to reduce costs that are not considered probable in their assessment of our ability to meet our obligations.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other\narrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our research, product development, or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We believe that of our critical accounting policies described under the heading Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following involve the most judgment and complexity:\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), which amended revenue recognition principles and provides a single, comprehensive set of criteria for revenue recognition within and across all industries. ASC 606 provides a five-step framework whereby revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when collectability of the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer is determined to be probable.\nAt contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess whether the goods or services promised within each contract are distinct and, therefore, represent a separate performance obligation. Goods and services that are determined not to be distinct are combined with other promised goods and services until a distinct bundle is identified. In determining whether goods or services are distinct, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (capable of being distinct) and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract (distinct in the context of the contract).\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes options for a customer to purchase additional services or products at agreed upon prices in the future, we evaluate whether each option provides a material right. An option that provides a material right will be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.\nWe then determine the transaction price, which is the amount of consideration expected to be received from a customer in exchange for the promised goods or services. Our estimate of the transaction price for each contract includes all fixed and variable consideration to which we expect to be entitled. Variable consideration includes payments in the form of collaboration payments, regulatory milestone payments, commercial milestone payments, and royalty payments. For collaboration, regulatory milestone, and commercial milestone payments, we evaluate whether it is probable that the consideration associated with each milestone will not be subject to a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized. Amounts that meet this threshold are included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method, whereas amounts that do not meet this threshold are considered constrained and excluded from the transaction price until they meet this threshold. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized for our milestones, and, if necessary, adjusts our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis. We exclude sales-based royalties until the sale occurs.\nASC 606 requires us to allocate the arrangement consideration on a relative standalone selling price basis for each performance obligation after determining the transaction price of the contract and identifying the performance obligations to which that amount should be allocated. The relative standalone selling price is defined as the price at which an entity would\nsell a promised good or service separately to a customer. If other observable transactions in which we have sold the same performance obligation separately are not available, we are required to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\nA performance obligation is satisfied and revenue is recognized when control\u201d of the promised good or service is transferred, either over time or at a point in time, to the customer. A customer obtains control of a good or service if it has the ability to (1) direct its use and (2) obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from it.\nFor performance obligations consisting of licenses and other promises (combined performance obligations), we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. We will recognize revenue using the cost-to-cost method, which we believe best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs expected upon satisfying the identified performance obligation. Under this method, revenue will be recorded as a percentage of the estimated transaction price based on the extent of progress towards completion. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement. The estimate of our measure of progress and estimate of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price will be updated at each reporting date as a change in estimate. The amount of transaction price allocated to the satisfied portion of the performance obligation, based on our measure of progress, will be recognized immediately on a cumulative catch-up basis, resulting in an adjustment to revenue in the period of change. The amount related to the unsatisfied portion will be recognized as that portion is satisfied over time.\nIf a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we will recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license.\nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria listed above are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within 12 months of the balance sheet date are classified as current deferred revenue. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the following 12 months of the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion. We recognize deferred revenue by first allocating from the beginning deferred revenue balance to the extent that the beginning deferred revenue balance exceeds the revenue to be recognized. Billings during the period are added to the deferred revenue balance to be recognized in future periods. To the extent that the beginning deferred revenue balance is less than revenue to be recognized during the period, billings during the period are allocated to revenue. In the event that a collaboration agreement was to be terminated and we had no further performance obligations, we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront payment and other payments that had not previously been recorded as revenue and were classified as deferred revenue at the date of such termination.\nAmounts are recorded as accounts receivable when our right to consideration is unconditional. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer will be one year or less. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> vendors in connection with the preclinical development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> CROs in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investigative sites in connection with clinical trials.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct, and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn determining whether an acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this is the case, the single identifiable asset or the group of similar assets is not deemed to be a business, and is instead deemed to be an asset. If this is not the case, we then further evaluate whether the single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets and activities includes, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. If so, we conclude that the single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets and activities is a business.\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Application of this method of accounting requires that (i) identifiable assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities assumed generally be measured and recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and (ii) the excess of the purchase price over the\nnet fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized as goodwill, which is not amortized for accounting purposes but is subject to testing for impairment at least annually. Acquired IPR&D is recognized at fair value and initially characterized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, irrespective of whether the acquired IPR&D has an alternative future use. Transaction costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nDuring the measurement period, which extends no later than one year from the acquisition date, we may record certain adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. After the measurement period, all adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as operating expenses or income.\nTo date, we have not recorded any acquisitions as a business combination.\nAsset Acquisitions\nWe measure and recognize asset acquisitions that are not deemed to be business combinations based on the cost to acquire the assets, which includes transaction costs. Goodwill is not recognized in asset acquisitions. In an asset acquisition, the cost allocated to acquire IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, non-employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with only service-based vesting conditions and apply the graded-vesting method to all awards with performance-based vesting conditions or to awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected volatility of our stock, (b) the expected term of the award, (c) the risk-free interest rate, and (d) expected dividends. Due to the lack of a public market for the trading of our common stock and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in a similar stage of development as us and that are publicly traded. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected term of our employee stock options using the \"simplified\" method, whereby, the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. We account for forfeitures as they occur. Upon adopting ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718) on January 1, 2019, we elected that unsettled equity-classified awards to nonemployees for which a measurement date has not been established to be measured using the adoption date fair value. All subsequent grants to non-employees will be accounted for consistently with grants to employees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nInflation Risk\nDuring the last two years, inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business. We are unable to predict whether inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases. Our approach is to design rational precision therapies that treat the underlying cause of disease and improve the lives of patients. Our most advanced program is CGT9486, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to potently inhibit the KIT D816V mutation as well as other mutations in KIT exon 17. In the vast majority of cases, KIT D816V is responsible for driving SM, a serious disease caused by unchecked proliferation of mast cells. Exon 17 mutations are also found in patients with advanced GIST, a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. CGT9486 is a highly selective and potent KIT inhibitor with the potential to provide a new treatment option for these patient populations.\nOn July 6, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Kiq, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. On October 2, 2020, we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to change our name from Unum Therapeutics Inc. to Cogent Biosciences, Inc. The name change became effective on October 6, 2020. In connection with the name change, our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol COGT.\u201d\nCGT9486 has been administered to more than 50 advanced solid tumor and GIST patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, with the vast majority of those patients living with advanced GIST. GIST is a disease frequently driven by KIT mutations, and resistance to currently available therapeutics is frequently associated with the emergence of other KIT mutations. Anti-tumor activity for CGT9486 was observed in both single agent and combination settings, including in combination with sunitinib, an approved treatment option for GIST patients. Clinical data from this trial have been presented at several scientific conferences, including most recently by Cogent at the 2020 annual CTOS meeting, and previously by Plexxikon, a member of the Daiichi Sankyo Group, at the 2018 annual ASCO meeting and the 2017 annual CTOS meeting. Within the group of 15 heavily pre-treated GIST patients who received the combination of CGT9486 and sunitinib, and who had not received prior treatment with CGT9486, the confirmed ORR was twenty percent, including two partial responses and one complete response, while the estimated mPFS for this group was twelve months. Four subjects continued to receive CGT9486 via individual patient INDs beyond the conclusion of the trial.\nBased on these results, we are planning an FDA interaction to explore further clinical development of CGT9486 in combination with sunitinib in GIST patients, and plan to initiate an additional clinical study in GIST in the second half of 2021.\nIn addition to continuing the development of CGT9486 in GIST patients, we are pursuing development of the compound in patients living with AdvSM and Non-AdvSM. The vast majority of AdvSM and Non-AdvSM patients have a KIT D816V mutation. Patients with AdvSM have a significantly diminished lifespan with a median survival of less than 3.5 years. For patients with Non-AdvSM, there are no available approved therapies, and while their lifespan is not impacted by the disease, these patients suffer from a poor quality of life and new treatment options are badly needed. Emerging clinical data for other kinase inhibitors with activity against KIT D816V have shown that the disease is highly sensitive to inhibition of the target. CGT9486 was specifically designed to selectively inhibit KIT mutations on exon 17, including KIT D816V, and we aim to expand the clinical development of this program to treat systemic mastocytosis patients.\nSubject to feedback from regulatory authorities, we expect to initiate clinical trials in AdvSM patients in the first half of 2021, followed by trials in Non-AdvSM patients in the second half of 2021. We expect to rapidly assess CGT9486 activity in mastocytosis patients by monitoring levels of serum tryptase, a relevant biomarker of disease activity which is elevated in these patients.\nWorldwide rights to develop and commercialize CGT9486, as well as an additional selective KIT inhibitor, CGT0206, were exclusively licensed by Kiq from Plexxikon. Under the terms of the License Agreement, Plexxikon received an upfront payment and is eligible for additional development milestones and mid- to high- single-digit royalty payments.\nPatents protecting CGT9486 include composition of matter claims which have issued in the US and other key territories and provide exclusivity through 2033 and potentially beyond through patent term extensions.\nIn addition to our small molecule efforts, we have developed proprietary technologies which enable cell therapy programs targeting cancers utilizing a patient's engineered T cells. Our ACTR (Antibody-Coupled T cell Receptor) product candidates incorporate a novel chimeric receptor that are designed to enable a co-administered, tumor-specific antibody to direct T cell targeting toward tumor cells. All ACTR clinical trials are closed to further enrollment. We have completed all closeout activities for 3 of 4 ACTR clinical trials as of December 31, 2020 and we anticipate closing out the last ACTR clinical trial in the first half of 2021.\nOn August 28, 2020, we completed the sale of our BOXR Platform, to Sotio, pursuant to the terms of the BOXR Platform Purchase Agreement.\nPursuant to the BOXR Platform Purchase Agreement, Sotio has agreed to pay us total cash consideration of up to $11.5 million, consisting of an upfront payment of $8.1 million ($1.73 million of which was placed in escrow for 90 days for general representations and warranties) and potential milestone payments of up to $3.4 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the issuance of specified claims (as described in the BOXR Platform Purchase Agreement) by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the European Patent Office. The $1.73 million held in escrow was released and received by the Company on November 30, 2020.\nSince our inception in 2014, we have focused significant efforts and financial resources on establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development of our product candidates, manufacturing drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials, staffing our company, and raising capital. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of preferred stock, our public offerings of our common stock, private placements and payments received under our Collaboration Agreement with Seagen.\nOn March 19, 2020, we entered into the LPC Purchase Agreement with LPC, pursuant to which we may elect to sell to LPC up to $25.0 million in shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the LPC Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the LPC Purchase Agreement, we issued 181,595 shares of common stock to LPC as a commitment fee. As of December 31, 2020, 2,412,870 registered common shares have been sold to LPC under the LPC Purchase Agreement for proceeds of $25.0 million. No additional shares may be sold to LPC under the LPC Purchase Agreement.\nOn March 26, 2020, we announced that we would be exploring strategic alternatives in order to maximize stockholder value and that we had engaged Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. to act as our strategic financial advisor to assist in the strategic review process. As of July 6, 2020, we successfully signed and closed the acquisition of Kiq.\nOn July 6, 2020, we issued a contingent value right (CVR), which was distributed to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 6, 2020, and prior to the issuance of any shares to acquire Kiq or sold to the PIPE investors. In November 2020, in partial settlement of the CVR obligation, we issued 707,938 shares of common stock. In February 2021, we issued an additional 212,428 shares of common stock and paid $0.1 million in partial settlement of the CVR obligation.\nOn July 9, 2020, we completed a PIPE with existing and new investors to raise gross proceeds of $104.4 million, or net proceeds of $98.9 million after deducting commissions and offering costs, in which the investors were issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $880 per share or, $3.52 per share on an as-converted-to-common basis.\nIn August 2020, our board of directors unanimously approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation, which would allow the board to effect a reverse stock split of all issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, at a ratio ranging from 1-for-4 to 1-for-8, inclusive, subject to stockholder approval. On October 9, 2020, we filed a Definitive Proxy Statement which included the proposal that our stockholders approve the amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect the reverse stock split and a proposal that the stockholders approve the conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred\nStock issued in the Kiq acquisition and the PIPE. The proposals were approved by the stockholders at a special meeting held on November 6, 2020 and our board of directors approved a ratio of 1-for-4 for the reverse stock split. The amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-4 was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on November 6, 2020. All disclosures of common shares, per common share data and preferred stock conversion ratios have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, but not any conversion of Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn December 4, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,794,872 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.75 per share. This included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 1,538,461 additional shares of common stock. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $107.7 million.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net loss was $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net loss of $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $198.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:\n \u2022 continue additional clinical trials for our product candidates; \n \u2022 continue to discover and develop additional product candidates; \n \u2022 acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; \n \u2022 maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 hire additional clinical, scientific, and commercial personnel; \n \u2022 establish manufacturing capabilities in-house; \n \u2022 establish a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; \n \u2022 seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u2022 establish sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and \n \u2022 add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts, as well as to support our transition to a public reporting company. \nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, and distribution.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $242.2 million. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and worldwide. We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19. We are monitoring the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and have taken steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a work-from-home policy for all employees who are able to perform their duties remotely and restricting all nonessential travel, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, the patients we serve and other business partners in light of COVID-19. Given the fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic however, we do not yet know the full extent of the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, among others. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which our business, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We will continue to work diligently with our partners and stakeholders to continue advancing our product candidate under regulatory review as well as in our clinical studies to the extent safe to do so for patients, caregivers and healthcare practitioners, and ensuring the continuity of our manufacturing and supply chain. For additional information related to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, please read Part I-Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or additional license or collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from additional collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties. Our revenue for the next several years, if any, will be derived primarily from any collaborations that we may enter into in the future.\nIn June 2015, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Seagen. Pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Seagen agreed to jointly develop two product candidates incorporating our ACTR platform and Seagen's antibodies. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we conducted preclinical research and clinical development activities related to the two specified product candidates through Phase 1 clinical development, and Seagen provided the funding for those activities. As a result of the Collaboration Agreement with Seagen, we recognized revenue of $7.9 million and $22.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the upfront payment received from Seagen under our Collaboration Agreement as well as reimbursements of research and development costs.\nOn January 16, 2020 (the Termination Date), we and Seagen announced an agreement to terminate the ATTCK-17-01 Phase 1 clinical trial and other research activities under the collaboration (the Termination Agreement). Pursuant to terms of the Termination Agreement, among other things, (i) Seagen paid us $5.75 million, (ii) Seagen surrendered, assigned and transferred to us all of its right, title and interest in the 207,961 shares of our common stock owned by Seagen, (iii) we will continue to be responsible for and pay all expenses for the wind-down of the ACTR-BCMA trial and (iv) Seagen paid all research and development costs incurred through the Termination Effective Date. In addition, the exclusivity provisions in the Collaboration Agreement terminate and each party will be free to research, develop and commercialize their individual intellectual property (either by themselves or with third parties, subject to the intellectual property rights of the other party.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contractors and CROs; \n \u2022 the cost of manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contractors and CMOs; \n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; \n \u2022 laboratory supplies and animal care; \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and \n \u2022 payments made under third-party licensing agreements. \nOur research and development costs include costs for the development of product candidates that were developed with Seagen and for which we have received reimbursement as specified in our Collaboration Agreement. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs, and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical and preclinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:\n \u2022 the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; \n \u2022 the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; \n \u2022 the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered, or may enter, into collaboration arrangements; \n \u2022 our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones; \n \u2022 our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements; \n \u2022 the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; \n \u2022 the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 the success in establishing and operating a manufacturing facility, or securing manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties; \n \u2022 our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally; \n \u2022 our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved; \n \u2022 the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors; \n \u2022 competition with other products; and \n \u2022 a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting, and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as of a result of the costs associated with the expansion of operations subsequent to the acquisition CGT9486.\nAcquired In-process Research and Development (IPR&D)\nWe expense acquired IPR&D in connection with an asset acquisition when there is no alternative future use, as determined by Management in accordance with GAAP.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents balances. Our interest income has not been significant due to low interest earned on invested balances.\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets consists of the gain recorded on the disposal of long-lived assets, including the BOXR platform related assets and other equipment.\nOther Income\nOther income consists of miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations, primarily income from subleasing a portion of our headquarters facilities.\nChange in fair value of the CVR liability\nThis consists of changes in the fair value of the CVR liability.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any current or deferred tax benefit for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our research and development tax credits generated, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020. We reevaluate the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits at each reporting period. As of December 31, 2020, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $63.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2035. As of December 31, 2020, we also had\nU.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2040 and 2035, respectively.\nUtilization of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period.\nAs a result of the shares issued in July 2020 related to the acquisition of Kiq and the sale of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company has experienced a change in ownership, as defined by Section 382. As a result of the ownership change, utilization of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitation under Section 382. Under Section 382, the annual limitation is determined by first multiplying the value of the Company's stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. This limitation resulted in the expiration of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards before utilization of $26.9 million and $79.5 million, respectively, and federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization of $6.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. We have written off these gross deferred tax attributes, which were previously fully reserved for, in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $59.4 million and $3.9 million of federal and state net operating losses, respectively, as well as $14.2 million of future amortization for federal purposes, are subject to the July 6 limitation of $0.3 million per year. A second ownership change occurred in December 2020 as a result of the underwritten public offering of common stock which resulted in a limitation of tax attributes generated from July 7, 2020 to December 1, 2020. The December 1, 2020 ownership change is not expected to have a material impact to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards as these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be utilized, subject to annual limitation, assuming sufficient taxable income is generated before expiration.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquired in-process research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (82,199\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32,178\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposal of long-lived assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of CVR liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,025\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (74,808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,833\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $7.9 million and $22.5 million, respectively. We recognize revenue from the upfront payment we received as well as ongoing reimbursements of research and development costs from Seagen by applying the costs-to-cost method over the performance period.\nCollaboration revenue fluctuates based upon our pattern of performance for each performance obligation and changes in estimated transaction price and costs to complete our performance obligations.\nOn January 16, 2020, Cogent and Seagen announced an agreement to terminate the ATTCK-17-01 Phase 1 clinical trial and other research activities under the collaboration. Pursuant to terms of the Termination Agreement, among other things, (i) Seagen paid Cogent $5.75 million and (ii) Seagen surrendered, assigned and transferred to Cogent all of its right, title and interest in the 207,961 shares of Cogent's common stock owned by Seagen.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, in considering all facts known, including the suspension of the ATTCK-17-01 clinical trial as announced in November 2019 and the expected termination of the Collaboration Agreement in January 2020, we adjusted the estimated transaction price to be the $25.0 million upfront payment from 2015 and the total payments to be earned for preclinical research and clinical development activities through the Termination Date. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we adjusted the transaction price to include the termination payment of $5.75 million as well as the aggregate fair value of $0.8 million as of January 16, 2020 of the 207,961 shares of common stock received. We also adjusted the costs to complete the remaining performance obligations to represent our best estimate as of December 31, 2020. Revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the termination payments previously discussed.\nAll performance obligations under the Collaboration Agreement are complete as of December 31, 2020 and all revenue has been recognized under the Collaboration Agreement. There is no remaining deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is driven by the conclusion of our legacy cell therapy clinical efforts and a reduction in force that resulted in the termination of approximately 60% of the Company's employee workforce, or 43 employees, in March 2020. These decreases are offset by the development of CGT9486, stock compensation expense charges of $1.4 million resulting from the acceleration of vesting linked to the Kiq acquisition and a $2.0 million reversal from a change in estimated costs associated with our legacy cell therapy clinical trials.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $17.4 million, compared to $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses was driven by increased personnel costs of $4.4 million, which includes stock compensation expense charges of $1.4 million resulting from the acceleration of vesting linked to the Kiq acquisition. Professional, consultant and other fees have increased $2.0 million as a result of the various transactions occurring during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAcquired In-process Research and Development (IPR&D)\nWe expensed acquired IPR&D, with an estimated fair value of $46.9 million, including $2.1 million of associated transaction costs, in connection with the Kiq asset acquisition as there was no alternative future use, as determined by Management in accordance with GAAP.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.1 million, compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income decreased due to lower average invested balances and lower interest rates in the current year compared to the prior period.\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets, net was $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $7.4 million change represents the net proceeds of the sale of the BOXR Platform as well as the proceeds from the sale of other long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther Income\nOther income, net was $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Other income represents sublease income recognized resulting from the sublease of a portion of our leased office space. No sublease income was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nChange in fair value of CVR liability\nChange in fair value of CVR liability for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents the change in the fair value of the CVR liability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred certain costs related to the COVID-19 outbreak as a result of taking necessary precautions for essential personnel to operate safely both in person as well as remotely. Costs incurred include items like incremental payroll costs, consulting support, IT infrastructure and facilities related costs. The estimated impact of COVID-19 is currently unknown. The final impact may vary based on the duration of the current social and economic conditions. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations in the future. We do not currently believe the accumulated costs will present a material impact to our financial liquidity or position.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have generated limited revenue to date from funding arrangements with our collaboration partner. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. We have historically funded our operations primarily through the public offering and private placement of our securities and consideration received from our collaborative agreements. See Funding Requirements\u201d and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our liquidity and capital resources.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2,412,870 shares have been sold under the LPC Purchase Agreement for proceeds of $25.0 million. No additional shares may be sold to LPC under the terms of the LPC Purchase Agreement.\nOn July 9, 2020, we completed a PIPE and issued 118,638 Series A Preferred Stock to new and existing investors in exchange gross proceeds of $104.4 million, or net proceeds of $98.9 million, after deducting commissions and estimated offering costs.\nOn December 4, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,794,872 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.75 per share (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 1,538,461 additional shares of common stock), or net proceeds from the offering of $107.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $242.2 million, which we expect will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024.\nThe Company expects that it will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with its ongoing business activities. The Company will need to seek additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements, partnerships, joint ventures, combinations or divestitures of one or more of its businesses. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into collaborative arrangements or divest its assets. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company's stockholders. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies or product candidates. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs or\ncommercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (35,850\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (41,514\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 232,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 204,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (18,247\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $35.9 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $74.8 million and from net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $5.3 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $44.3 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of a $4.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a $1.3 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $1.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $0.8 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $0.7 million decrease in the right-of-use asset, and a $0.4 million decrease in other assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $41.5 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $31.8 million and from net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $14.1 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $4.4 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of a $16.6 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $0.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $0.4 million increase in other assets, all partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nChanges in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in all periods were generally due to changes in our business, the advancement of our product candidates, and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by investing activities was $8.4 million, which consisted of $8.1 million in proceeds from the disposal of the BOXR Platform as well as $0.3 million in proceeds from the sale of other property and equipment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by investing activities was $23.2 million, which consisted of net purchases of maturities and sale of marketable securities of $23.0 million and $0.2 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of $0.1 million.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $232.2 million which consisted of $107.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in underwritten public offering, net of issuance costs, $98.9 million in proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock and common stock, net of issuance costs, $25.0 million from the issuance of common stock to LPC, $0.5 million from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises, and $0.1 million from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.1 million from the proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance clinical development of our product candidates, preclinical activities, and wind-down our legacy clinical trials. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:\n \u2022 the initiation, progress, timing, and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future potential product candidates, including the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing and planned research and development efforts; \n \u2022 any delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority's review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA's issuance of a refusal to file\u201d letter or a request for additional information; \n \u2022 adverse results or delays in clinical trials; \n \u2022 our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial, or to terminate an existing clinical trial; \n \u2022 adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates; \n \u2022 changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals; \n \u2022 adverse developments concerning our manufacturers; \n \u2022 our inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices; \n \u2022 our inability to establish collaborations if needed; \n \u2022 our failure to commercialize our product candidates; \n \u2022 additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel; \n \u2022 unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 the impact of COVID-19 on the operations of key governmental agencies, such as the FDA, which may delay the development of our current product candidates or any future product candidates. \nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of $242.2 million as of December 31, 2020 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining benefits from cost saving measures implemented or planned or in obtaining additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all, nor is it considered probable under the accounting standards. As such, under the requirements of ASC 205-40, management may not consider the potential for future capital raises or management plans to reduce costs that are not considered probable in their assessment of our ability to meet our obligations.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other\narrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our research, product development, or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We believe that of our critical accounting policies described under the heading Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following involve the most judgment and complexity:\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), which amended revenue recognition principles and provides a single, comprehensive set of criteria for revenue recognition within and across all industries. ASC 606 provides a five-step framework whereby revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when collectability of the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer is determined to be probable.\nAt contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess whether the goods or services promised within each contract are distinct and, therefore, represent a separate performance obligation. Goods and services that are determined not to be distinct are combined with other promised goods and services until a distinct bundle is identified. In determining whether goods or services are distinct, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (capable of being distinct) and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract (distinct in the context of the contract).\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes options for a customer to purchase additional services or products at agreed upon prices in the future, we evaluate whether each option provides a material right. An option that provides a material right will be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.\nWe then determine the transaction price, which is the amount of consideration expected to be received from a customer in exchange for the promised goods or services. Our estimate of the transaction price for each contract includes all fixed and variable consideration to which we expect to be entitled. Variable consideration includes payments in the form of collaboration payments, regulatory milestone payments, commercial milestone payments, and royalty payments. For collaboration, regulatory milestone, and commercial milestone payments, we evaluate whether it is probable that the consideration associated with each milestone will not be subject to a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized. Amounts that meet this threshold are included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method, whereas amounts that do not meet this threshold are considered constrained and excluded from the transaction price until they meet this threshold. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized for our milestones, and, if necessary, adjusts our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis. We exclude sales-based royalties until the sale occurs.\nASC 606 requires us to allocate the arrangement consideration on a relative standalone selling price basis for each performance obligation after determining the transaction price of the contract and identifying the performance obligations to which that amount should be allocated. The relative standalone selling price is defined as the price at which an entity would\nsell a promised good or service separately to a customer. If other observable transactions in which we have sold the same performance obligation separately are not available, we are required to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\nA performance obligation is satisfied and revenue is recognized when control\u201d of the promised good or service is transferred, either over time or at a point in time, to the customer. A customer obtains control of a good or service if it has the ability to (1) direct its use and (2) obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from it.\nFor performance obligations consisting of licenses and other promises (combined performance obligations), we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. We will recognize revenue using the cost-to-cost method, which we believe best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs expected upon satisfying the identified performance obligation. Under this method, revenue will be recorded as a percentage of the estimated transaction price based on the extent of progress towards completion. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement. The estimate of our measure of progress and estimate of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price will be updated at each reporting date as a change in estimate. The amount of transaction price allocated to the satisfied portion of the performance obligation, based on our measure of progress, will be recognized immediately on a cumulative catch-up basis, resulting in an adjustment to revenue in the period of change. The amount related to the unsatisfied portion will be recognized as that portion is satisfied over time.\nIf a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we will recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license.\nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria listed above are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within 12 months of the balance sheet date are classified as current deferred revenue. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the following 12 months of the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion. We recognize deferred revenue by first allocating from the beginning deferred revenue balance to the extent that the beginning deferred revenue balance exceeds the revenue to be recognized. Billings during the period are added to the deferred revenue balance to be recognized in future periods. To the extent that the beginning deferred revenue balance is less than revenue to be recognized during the period, billings during the period are allocated to revenue. In the event that a collaboration agreement was to be terminated and we had no further performance obligations, we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront payment and other payments that had not previously been recorded as revenue and were classified as deferred revenue at the date of such termination.\nAmounts are recorded as accounts receivable when our right to consideration is unconditional. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer will be one year or less. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 vendors in connection with the preclinical development activities; \n \u2022 CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 CROs in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials; and \n \u2022 investigative sites in connection with clinical trials. \nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct, and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn determining whether an acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this is the case, the single identifiable asset or the group of similar assets is not deemed to be a business, and is instead deemed to be an asset. If this is not the case, we then further evaluate whether the single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets and activities includes, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. If so, we conclude that the single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets and activities is a business.\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Application of this method of accounting requires that (i) identifiable assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities assumed generally be measured and recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and (ii) the excess of the purchase price over the\nnet fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized as goodwill, which is not amortized for accounting purposes but is subject to testing for impairment at least annually. Acquired IPR&D is recognized at fair value and initially characterized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, irrespective of whether the acquired IPR&D has an alternative future use. Transaction costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nDuring the measurement period, which extends no later than one year from the acquisition date, we may record certain adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. After the measurement period, all adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as operating expenses or income.\nTo date, we have not recorded any acquisitions as a business combination.\nAsset Acquisitions\nWe measure and recognize asset acquisitions that are not deemed to be business combinations based on the cost to acquire the assets, which includes transaction costs. Goodwill is not recognized in asset acquisitions. In an asset acquisition, the cost allocated to acquire IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, non-employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with only service-based vesting conditions and apply the graded-vesting method to all awards with performance-based vesting conditions or to awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected volatility of our stock, (b) the expected term of the award, (c) the risk-free interest rate, and (d) expected dividends. Due to the lack of a public market for the trading of our common stock and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in a similar stage of development as us and that are publicly traded. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected term of our employee stock options using the \"simplified\" method, whereby, the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. We account for forfeitures as they occur. Upon adopting ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718) on January 1, 2019, we elected that unsettled equity-classified awards to nonemployees for which a measurement date has not been established to be measured using the adoption date fair value. All subsequent grants to non-employees will be accounted for consistently with grants to employees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nInflation Risk\nDuring the last two years, inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business. We are unable to predict whether inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases. Our approach is to design rational precision therapies that treat the underlying cause of disease and improve the lives of patients. Our most advanced program is CGT9486, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to potently inhibit the KIT D816V mutation as well as other mutations in KIT exon 17. In the vast majority of cases, KIT D816V is responsible for driving SM, a serious disease caused by unchecked proliferation of mast cells. Exon 17 mutations are also found in patients with advanced GIST, a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. CGT9486 is a highly selective and potent KIT inhibitor with the potential to provide a new treatment option for these patient populations.\nOn July 6, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Kiq, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. On October 2, 2020, we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to change our name from Unum Therapeutics Inc. to Cogent Biosciences, Inc. The name change became effective on October 6, 2020. In connection with the name change, our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol COGT.\u201d\nCGT9486 has been administered to more than 50 advanced solid tumor and GIST patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, with the vast majority of those patients living with advanced GIST. GIST is a disease frequently driven by KIT mutations, and resistance to currently available therapeutics is frequently associated with the emergence of other KIT mutations. Anti-tumor activity for CGT9486 was observed in both single agent and combination settings, including in combination with sunitinib, an approved treatment option for GIST patients. Clinical data from this trial have been presented at several scientific conferences, including most recently by Cogent at the 2020 annual CTOS meeting, and previously by Plexxikon, a member of the Daiichi Sankyo Group, at the 2018 annual ASCO meeting and the 2017 annual CTOS meeting. Within the group of 15 heavily pre-treated GIST patients who received the combination of CGT9486 and sunitinib, and who had not received prior treatment with CGT9486, the confirmed ORR was twenty percent, including two partial responses and one complete response, while the estimated mPFS for this group was twelve months. Four subjects continued to receive CGT9486 via individual patient INDs beyond the conclusion of the trial.\nBased on these results, we are planning an FDA interaction to explore further clinical development of CGT9486 in combination with sunitinib in GIST patients, and plan to initiate an additional clinical study in GIST in the second half of 2021.\nIn addition to continuing the development of CGT9486 in GIST patients, we are pursuing development of the compound in patients living with AdvSM and Non-AdvSM. The vast majority of AdvSM and Non-AdvSM patients have a KIT D816V mutation. Patients with AdvSM have a significantly diminished lifespan with a median survival of less than 3.5 years. For patients with Non-AdvSM, there are no available approved therapies, and while their lifespan is not impacted by the disease, these patients suffer from a poor quality of life and new treatment options are badly needed. Emerging clinical data for other kinase inhibitors with activity against KIT D816V have shown that the disease is highly sensitive to inhibition of the target. CGT9486 was specifically designed to selectively inhibit KIT mutations on exon 17, including KIT D816V, and we aim to expand the clinical development of this program to treat systemic mastocytosis patients.\nSubject to feedback from regulatory authorities, we expect to initiate clinical trials in AdvSM patients in the first half of 2021, followed by trials in Non-AdvSM patients in the second half of 2021. We expect to rapidly assess CGT9486 activity in mastocytosis patients by monitoring levels of serum tryptase, a relevant biomarker of disease activity which is elevated in these patients.\nWorldwide rights to develop and commercialize CGT9486, as well as an additional selective KIT inhibitor, CGT0206, were exclusively licensed by Kiq from Plexxikon. Under the terms of the License Agreement, Plexxikon received an upfront payment and is eligible for additional development milestones and mid- to high- single-digit royalty payments.\nPatents protecting CGT9486 include composition of matter claims which have issued in the US and other key territories and provide exclusivity through 2033 and potentially beyond through patent term extensions.\nIn addition to our small molecule efforts, we have developed proprietary technologies which enable cell therapy programs targeting cancers utilizing a patient's engineered T cells. Our ACTR (Antibody-Coupled T cell Receptor) product candidates incorporate a novel chimeric receptor that are designed to enable a co-administered, tumor-specific antibody to direct T cell targeting toward tumor cells. All ACTR clinical trials are closed to further enrollment. We have completed all closeout activities for 3 of 4 ACTR clinical trials as of December 31, 2020 and we anticipate closing out the last ACTR clinical trial in the first half of 2021.\nOn August 28, 2020, we completed the sale of our BOXR Platform, to Sotio, pursuant to the terms of the BOXR Platform Purchase Agreement.\nPursuant to the BOXR Platform Purchase Agreement, Sotio has agreed to pay us total cash consideration of up to $11.5 million, consisting of an upfront payment of $8.1 million ($1.73 million of which was placed in escrow for 90 days for general representations and warranties) and potential milestone payments of up to $3.4 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the issuance of specified claims (as described in the BOXR Platform Purchase Agreement) by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the European Patent Office. The $1.73 million held in escrow was released and received by the Company on November 30, 2020.\nSince our inception in 2014, we have focused significant efforts and financial resources on establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development of our product candidates, manufacturing drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials, staffing our company, and raising capital. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of preferred stock, our public offerings of our common stock, private placements and payments received under our Collaboration Agreement with Seagen.\nOn March 19, 2020, we entered into the LPC Purchase Agreement with LPC, pursuant to which we may elect to sell to LPC up to $25.0 million in shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the LPC Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the LPC Purchase Agreement, we issued 181,595 shares of common stock to LPC as a commitment fee. As of December 31, 2020, 2,412,870 registered common shares have been sold to LPC under the LPC Purchase Agreement for proceeds of $25.0 million. No additional shares may be sold to LPC under the LPC Purchase Agreement.\nOn March 26, 2020, we announced that we would be exploring strategic alternatives in order to maximize stockholder value and that we had engaged Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. to act as our strategic financial advisor to assist in the strategic review process. As of July 6, 2020, we successfully signed and closed the acquisition of Kiq.\nOn July 6, 2020, we issued a contingent value right (CVR), which was distributed to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 6, 2020, and prior to the issuance of any shares to acquire Kiq or sold to the PIPE investors. In November 2020, in partial settlement of the CVR obligation, we issued 707,938 shares of common stock. In February 2021, we issued an additional 212,428 shares of common stock and paid $0.1 million in partial settlement of the CVR obligation.\nOn July 9, 2020, we completed a PIPE with existing and new investors to raise gross proceeds of $104.4 million, or net proceeds of $98.9 million after deducting commissions and offering costs, in which the investors were issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $880 per share or, $3.52 per share on an as-converted-to-common basis.\nIn August 2020, our board of directors unanimously approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation, which would allow the board to effect a reverse stock split of all issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, at a ratio ranging from 1-for-4 to 1-for-8, inclusive, subject to stockholder approval. On October 9, 2020, we filed a Definitive Proxy Statement which included the proposal that our stockholders approve the amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect the reverse stock split and a proposal that the stockholders approve the conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred\nStock issued in the Kiq acquisition and the PIPE. The proposals were approved by the stockholders at a special meeting held on November 6, 2020 and our board of directors approved a ratio of 1-for-4 for the reverse stock split. The amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-4 was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on November 6, 2020. All disclosures of common shares, per common share data and preferred stock conversion ratios have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, but not any conversion of Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn December 4, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,794,872 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.75 per share. This included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 1,538,461 additional shares of common stock. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $107.7 million.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net loss was $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net loss of $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $198.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:\n \u2022 continue additional clinical trials for our product candidates; \n \u2022 continue to discover and develop additional product candidates; \n \u2022 acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; \n \u2022 maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 hire additional clinical, scientific, and commercial personnel; \n \u2022 establish manufacturing capabilities in-house; \n \u2022 establish a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; \n \u2022 seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u2022 establish sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and \n \u2022 add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts, as well as to support our transition to a public reporting company. \nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, and distribution.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $242.2 million. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and worldwide. We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19. We are monitoring the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and have taken steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a work-from-home policy for all employees who are able to perform their duties remotely and restricting all nonessential travel, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, the patients we serve and other business partners in light of COVID-19. Given the fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic however, we do not yet know the full extent of the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, among others. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which our business, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We will continue to work diligently with our partners and stakeholders to continue advancing our product candidate under regulatory review as well as in our clinical studies to the extent safe to do so for patients, caregivers and healthcare practitioners, and ensuring the continuity of our manufacturing and supply chain. For additional information related to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, please read Part I-Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or additional license or collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from additional collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties. Our revenue for the next several years, if any, will be derived primarily from any collaborations that we may enter into in the future.\nIn June 2015, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Seagen. Pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Seagen agreed to jointly develop two product candidates incorporating our ACTR platform and Seagen's antibodies. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we conducted preclinical research and clinical development activities related to the two specified product candidates through Phase 1 clinical development, and Seagen provided the funding for those activities. As a result of the Collaboration Agreement with Seagen, we recognized revenue of $7.9 million and $22.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the upfront payment received from Seagen under our Collaboration Agreement as well as reimbursements of research and development costs.\nOn January 16, 2020 (the Termination Date), we and Seagen announced an agreement to terminate the ATTCK-17-01 Phase 1 clinical trial and other research activities under the collaboration (the Termination Agreement). Pursuant to terms of the Termination Agreement, among other things, (i) Seagen paid us $5.75 million, (ii) Seagen surrendered, assigned and transferred to us all of its right, title and interest in the 207,961 shares of our common stock owned by Seagen, (iii) we will continue to be responsible for and pay all expenses for the wind-down of the ACTR-BCMA trial and (iv) Seagen paid all research and development costs incurred through the Termination Effective Date. In addition, the exclusivity provisions in the Collaboration Agreement terminate and each party will be free to research, develop and commercialize their individual intellectual property (either by themselves or with third parties, subject to the intellectual property rights of the other party.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u2022 expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contractors and CROs; \n \u2022 the cost of manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contractors and CMOs; \n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; \n \u2022 laboratory supplies and animal care; \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and \n \u2022 payments made under third-party licensing agreements. \nOur research and development costs include costs for the development of product candidates that were developed with Seagen and for which we have received reimbursement as specified in our Collaboration Agreement. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nOur direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs, and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical and preclinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:\n \u2022 the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; \n \u2022 the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; \n \u2022 the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered, or may enter, into collaboration arrangements; \n \u2022 our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones; \n \u2022 our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements; \n \u2022 the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; \n \u2022 the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u2022 the success in establishing and operating a manufacturing facility, or securing manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties; \n \u2022 our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally; \n \u2022 our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved; \n \u2022 the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors; \n \u2022 competition with other products; and \n \u2022 a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting, and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as of a result of the costs associated with the expansion of operations subsequent to the acquisition CGT9486.\nAcquired In-process Research and Development (IPR&D)\nWe expense acquired IPR&D in connection with an asset acquisition when there is no alternative future use, as determined by Management in accordance with GAAP.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents balances. Our interest income has not been significant due to low interest earned on invested balances.\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets consists of the gain recorded on the disposal of long-lived assets, including the BOXR platform related assets and other equipment.\nOther Income\nOther income consists of miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations, primarily income from subleasing a portion of our headquarters facilities.\nChange in fair value of the CVR liability\nThis consists of changes in the fair value of the CVR liability.\nIncome Taxes\nSince our inception, we have not recorded any current or deferred tax benefit for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our research and development tax credits generated, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020. We reevaluate the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits at each reporting period. As of December 31, 2020, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $63.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2035. As of December 31, 2020, we also had\nU.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2040 and 2035, respectively.\nUtilization of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period.\nAs a result of the shares issued in July 2020 related to the acquisition of Kiq and the sale of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company has experienced a change in ownership, as defined by Section 382. As a result of the ownership change, utilization of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitation under Section 382. Under Section 382, the annual limitation is determined by first multiplying the value of the Company's stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. This limitation resulted in the expiration of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards before utilization of $26.9 million and $79.5 million, respectively, and federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization of $6.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. We have written off these gross deferred tax attributes, which were previously fully reserved for, in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $59.4 million and $3.9 million of federal and state net operating losses, respectively, as well as $14.2 million of future amortization for federal purposes, are subject to the July 6 limitation of $0.3 million per year. A second ownership change occurred in December 2020 as a result of the underwritten public offering of common stock which resulted in a limitation of tax attributes generated from July 7, 2020 to December 1, 2020. The December 1, 2020 ownership change is not expected to have a material impact to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards as these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be utilized, subject to annual limitation, assuming sufficient taxable income is generated before expiration.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $7.9 million and $22.5 million, respectively. We recognize revenue from the upfront payment we received as well as ongoing reimbursements of research and development costs from Seagen by applying the costs-to-cost method over the performance period.\nCollaboration revenue fluctuates based upon our pattern of performance for each performance obligation and changes in estimated transaction price and costs to complete our performance obligations.\nOn January 16, 2020, Cogent and Seagen announced an agreement to terminate the ATTCK-17-01 Phase 1 clinical trial and other research activities under the collaboration. Pursuant to terms of the Termination Agreement, among other things, (i) Seagen paid Cogent $5.75 million and (ii) Seagen surrendered, assigned and transferred to Cogent all of its right, title and interest in the 207,961 shares of Cogent's common stock owned by Seagen.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, in considering all facts known, including the suspension of the ATTCK-17-01 clinical trial as announced in November 2019 and the expected termination of the Collaboration Agreement in January 2020, we adjusted the estimated transaction price to be the $25.0 million upfront payment from 2015 and the total payments to be earned for preclinical research and clinical development activities through the Termination Date. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we adjusted the transaction price to include the termination payment of $5.75 million as well as the aggregate fair value of $0.8 million as of January 16, 2020 of the 207,961 shares of common stock received. We also adjusted the costs to complete the remaining performance obligations to represent our best estimate as of December 31, 2020. Revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the termination payments previously discussed.\nAll performance obligations under the Collaboration Agreement are complete as of December 31, 2020 and all revenue has been recognized under the Collaboration Agreement. There is no remaining deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is driven by the conclusion of our legacy cell therapy clinical efforts and a reduction in force that resulted in the termination of approximately 60% of the Company's employee workforce, or 43 employees, in March 2020. These decreases are offset by the development of CGT9486, stock compensation expense charges of $1.4 million resulting from the acceleration of vesting linked to the Kiq acquisition and a $2.0 million reversal from a change in estimated costs associated with our legacy cell therapy clinical trials.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $17.4 million, compared to $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses was driven by increased personnel costs of $4.4 million, which includes stock compensation expense charges of $1.4 million resulting from the acceleration of vesting linked to the Kiq acquisition. Professional, consultant and other fees have increased $2.0 million as a result of the various transactions occurring during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAcquired In-process Research and Development (IPR&D)\nWe expensed acquired IPR&D, with an estimated fair value of $46.9 million, including $2.1 million of associated transaction costs, in connection with the Kiq asset acquisition as there was no alternative future use, as determined by Management in accordance with GAAP.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.1 million, compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income decreased due to lower average invested balances and lower interest rates in the current year compared to the prior period.\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets\nGain on disposal of long-lived assets, net was $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $7.4 million change represents the net proceeds of the sale of the BOXR Platform as well as the proceeds from the sale of other long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther Income\nOther income, net was $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Other income represents sublease income recognized resulting from the sublease of a portion of our leased office space. No sublease income was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nChange in fair value of CVR liability\nChange in fair value of CVR liability for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents the change in the fair value of the CVR liability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred certain costs related to the COVID-19 outbreak as a result of taking necessary precautions for essential personnel to operate safely both in person as well as remotely. Costs incurred include items like incremental payroll costs, consulting support, IT infrastructure and facilities related costs. The estimated impact of COVID-19 is currently unknown. The final impact may vary based on the duration of the current social and economic conditions. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations in the future. We do not currently believe the accumulated costs will present a material impact to our financial liquidity or position.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have generated limited revenue to date from funding arrangements with our collaboration partner. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. We have historically funded our operations primarily through the public offering and private placement of our securities and consideration received from our collaborative agreements. See Funding Requirements\u201d and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our liquidity and capital resources.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2,412,870 shares have been sold under the LPC Purchase Agreement for proceeds of $25.0 million. No additional shares may be sold to LPC under the terms of the LPC Purchase Agreement.\nOn July 9, 2020, we completed a PIPE and issued 118,638 Series A Preferred Stock to new and existing investors in exchange gross proceeds of $104.4 million, or net proceeds of $98.9 million, after deducting commissions and estimated offering costs.\nOn December 4, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,794,872 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.75 per share (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 1,538,461 additional shares of common stock), or net proceeds from the offering of $107.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $242.2 million, which we expect will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024.\nThe Company expects that it will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with its ongoing business activities. The Company will need to seek additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements, partnerships, joint ventures, combinations or divestitures of one or more of its businesses. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into collaborative arrangements or divest its assets. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company's stockholders. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies or product candidates. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs or\ncommercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\n\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $35.9 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $74.8 million and from net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $5.3 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $44.3 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of a $4.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a $1.3 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $1.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $0.8 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $0.7 million decrease in the right-of-use asset, and a $0.4 million decrease in other assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $41.5 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $31.8 million and from net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $14.1 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $4.4 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of a $16.6 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $0.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $0.4 million increase in other assets, all partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nChanges in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in all periods were generally due to changes in our business, the advancement of our product candidates, and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by investing activities was $8.4 million, which consisted of $8.1 million in proceeds from the disposal of the BOXR Platform as well as $0.3 million in proceeds from the sale of other property and equipment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by investing activities was $23.2 million, which consisted of net purchases of maturities and sale of marketable securities of $23.0 million and $0.2 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of $0.1 million.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $232.2 million which consisted of $107.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in underwritten public offering, net of issuance costs, $98.9 million in proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock and common stock, net of issuance costs, $25.0 million from the issuance of common stock to LPC, $0.5 million from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises, and $0.1 million from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.1 million from the proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance clinical development of our product candidates, preclinical activities, and wind-down our legacy clinical trials. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:\n \u2022 the initiation, progress, timing, and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future potential product candidates, including the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing and planned research and development efforts; \n \u2022 any delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority's review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA's issuance of a refusal to file\u201d letter or a request for additional information; \n \u2022 adverse results or delays in clinical trials; \n \u2022 our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial, or to terminate an existing clinical trial; \n \u2022 adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates; \n \u2022 changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals; \n \u2022 adverse developments concerning our manufacturers; \n \u2022 our inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices; \n \u2022 our inability to establish collaborations if needed; \n \u2022 our failure to commercialize our product candidates; \n \u2022 additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel; \n \u2022 unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 the impact of COVID-19 on the operations of key governmental agencies, such as the FDA, which may delay the development of our current product candidates or any future product candidates. \nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of $242.2 million as of December 31, 2020 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining benefits from cost saving measures implemented or planned or in obtaining additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all, nor is it considered probable under the accounting standards. As such, under the requirements of ASC 205-40, management may not consider the potential for future capital raises or management plans to reduce costs that are not considered probable in their assessment of our ability to meet our obligations.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other\narrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our research, product development, or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We believe that of our critical accounting policies described under the heading Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following involve the most judgment and complexity:\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), which amended revenue recognition principles and provides a single, comprehensive set of criteria for revenue recognition within and across all industries. ASC 606 provides a five-step framework whereby revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when collectability of the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer is determined to be probable.\nAt contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess whether the goods or services promised within each contract are distinct and, therefore, represent a separate performance obligation. Goods and services that are determined not to be distinct are combined with other promised goods and services until a distinct bundle is identified. In determining whether goods or services are distinct, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (capable of being distinct) and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other goods or services in the contract (distinct in the context of the contract).\nAt the inception of an arrangement that includes options for a customer to purchase additional services or products at agreed upon prices in the future, we evaluate whether each option provides a material right. An option that provides a material right will be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.\nWe then determine the transaction price, which is the amount of consideration expected to be received from a customer in exchange for the promised goods or services. Our estimate of the transaction price for each contract includes all fixed and variable consideration to which we expect to be entitled. Variable consideration includes payments in the form of collaboration payments, regulatory milestone payments, commercial milestone payments, and royalty payments. For collaboration, regulatory milestone, and commercial milestone payments, we evaluate whether it is probable that the consideration associated with each milestone will not be subject to a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized. Amounts that meet this threshold are included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method, whereas amounts that do not meet this threshold are considered constrained and excluded from the transaction price until they meet this threshold. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized for our milestones, and, if necessary, adjusts our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis. We exclude sales-based royalties until the sale occurs.\nASC 606 requires us to allocate the arrangement consideration on a relative standalone selling price basis for each performance obligation after determining the transaction price of the contract and identifying the performance obligations to which that amount should be allocated. The relative standalone selling price is defined as the price at which an entity would\nsell a promised good or service separately to a customer. If other observable transactions in which we have sold the same performance obligation separately are not available, we are required to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\nA performance obligation is satisfied and revenue is recognized when control\u201d of the promised good or service is transferred, either over time or at a point in time, to the customer. A customer obtains control of a good or service if it has the ability to (1) direct its use and (2) obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from it.\nFor performance obligations consisting of licenses and other promises (combined performance obligations), we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. We will recognize revenue using the cost-to-cost method, which we believe best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs expected upon satisfying the identified performance obligation. Under this method, revenue will be recorded as a percentage of the estimated transaction price based on the extent of progress towards completion. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement. The estimate of our measure of progress and estimate of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price will be updated at each reporting date as a change in estimate. The amount of transaction price allocated to the satisfied portion of the performance obligation, based on our measure of progress, will be recognized immediately on a cumulative catch-up basis, resulting in an adjustment to revenue in the period of change. The amount related to the unsatisfied portion will be recognized as that portion is satisfied over time.\nIf a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we will recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license.\nAmounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria listed above are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within 12 months of the balance sheet date are classified as current deferred revenue. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the following 12 months of the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion. We recognize deferred revenue by first allocating from the beginning deferred revenue balance to the extent that the beginning deferred revenue balance exceeds the revenue to be recognized. Billings during the period are added to the deferred revenue balance to be recognized in future periods. To the extent that the beginning deferred revenue balance is less than revenue to be recognized during the period, billings during the period are allocated to revenue. In the event that a collaboration agreement was to be terminated and we had no further performance obligations, we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront payment and other payments that had not previously been recorded as revenue and were classified as deferred revenue at the date of such termination.\nAmounts are recorded as accounts receivable when our right to consideration is unconditional. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer will be one year or less. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n \u2022 vendors in connection with the preclinical development activities; \n \u2022 CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; \n \u2022 CROs in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials; and \n \u2022 investigative sites in connection with clinical trials. \nWe base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct, and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn determining whether an acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this is the case, the single identifiable asset or the group of similar assets is not deemed to be a business, and is instead deemed to be an asset. If this is not the case, we then further evaluate whether the single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets and activities includes, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. If so, we conclude that the single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets and activities is a business.\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Application of this method of accounting requires that (i) identifiable assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities assumed generally be measured and recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and (ii) the excess of the purchase price over the\nnet fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized as goodwill, which is not amortized for accounting purposes but is subject to testing for impairment at least annually. Acquired IPR&D is recognized at fair value and initially characterized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, irrespective of whether the acquired IPR&D has an alternative future use. Transaction costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nDuring the measurement period, which extends no later than one year from the acquisition date, we may record certain adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. After the measurement period, all adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as operating expenses or income.\nTo date, we have not recorded any acquisitions as a business combination.\nAsset Acquisitions\nWe measure and recognize asset acquisitions that are not deemed to be business combinations based on the cost to acquire the assets, which includes transaction costs. Goodwill is not recognized in asset acquisitions. In an asset acquisition, the cost allocated to acquire IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, non-employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with only service-based vesting conditions and apply the graded-vesting method to all awards with performance-based vesting conditions or to awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected volatility of our stock, (b) the expected term of the award, (c) the risk-free interest rate, and (d) expected dividends. Due to the lack of a public market for the trading of our common stock and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in a similar stage of development as us and that are publicly traded. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected term of our employee stock options using the \"simplified\" method, whereby, the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. We account for forfeitures as they occur. Upon adopting ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718) on January 1, 2019, we elected that unsettled equity-classified awards to nonemployees for which a measurement date has not been established to be measured using the adoption date fair value.

The report contains forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, and should be read alongside the financial statements and related notes at the end of the annual Form 10-K it pertains to.\n\n**Overview:**\n- The company has completed its acquisition of Kiq and changed its name to Cogent Biosciences, Inc., with shares trading under the ticker COGT.\n- CGT9486 has shown promise in clinical trials for patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), diseases impacted by mutations in the KIT gene.\n- CGT9486, administered in over 50 patients, showed anti-tumor activity, including when combined with sunitinib.\n- For GIST, additional trials are planned and further FDA discussions are anticipated.\n- The company holds exclusive rights to develop and commercialize CGT9486 and CGT0206, another selective KIT inhibitor.\n\n**Financial Highlights:**\n- Since commencement in 2014, the company has not generated product sales revenue, relying instead on stock sales, public offerings, private placements, and collaborative agreements for funding.\n- Net losses were $74.8 million for 2020, compared to $31.8 million for 2019, with an accumulated deficit at $198.7 million as of December 31, 2020.\n- An increase in expenses is expected as they expand trials, discover new candidates, and prepare for future commercialization.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic may further affect operations.\n- As of December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents totaled $242.2 million, anticipated to cover expenses into 2024.\n- Financing includes equity offerings, debt financings, and potential collaborations or licensing arrangements.\n- The report also details other income and expenses, including gains on disposal of assets, licensing revenue, and changes stemming from the stock reverse split and PIPE (private investment in public equity) financing.\n- Significant accounting policies include revenue recognition, accrued expenses estimates related to research and development, stock-based compensation, and business combination accounting.\n\n**Strategic and Operational Developments:**\n- The company\u2019s goals include continued clinical trials, seeking regulatory approvals, potential expansion of manufacturing, team strengthening, and ensuring they can generate enough revenue to sustain the company until profitability can be achieved.\n- They've sold the BOXR platform for up to $11.5 million, providing further funding.\n- The risks of succeeding in this sector are considerable, from clinical trial results to regulatory approvals and commercial competition.\n- Certain strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, such as collaborations or rights relinquishing, might be explored.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources:**\n- They've entered various agreements to secure funding including selling common stock through LPC Purchase Agreement and underwritten public offerings.\n- The company anticipates the need for more funding to continue their operations and plans for growth.\n\n**COVID-19 Pandemic Impact:**\n- The pandemic led to modified business practices and might cause material adverse effects due to the ongoing uncertainty. It has also influenced regulatory agency operations like the FDA, which could affect development and review timelines.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The MD&A underscores the company\u2019s dedication to advancing possible treatments for diseases with genetic foundations, but also illustrates the uncertainties and financial challenges inherent in pharmaceutical development. The urgency of seeking further funding and progressing toward regulatory approval and potential commercialization is evident."}
