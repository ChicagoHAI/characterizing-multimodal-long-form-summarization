MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND STATEMENT OF\nINCOME\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the discussion under Application of Critical Accounting Policies\u201d (also under Item 7), which describes key estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements; Item 1. Business,\u201d which describes our operations; and Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d which describes key risks associated with our operations and markets in which we operate. A reference to a Note\u201d in this section refers to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOverview\nWe offer our communication services and products in the United States and abroad primarily to three major market segments: healthcare, government and large enterprise, but with a greater emphasis on the healthcare market segment. For wireless revenue, the government business has been trending downward over the last several years as state and local governments have been struggling with budget constraints. Large enterprise customers have been trending away from paging to cellular/smart phones for a number of years and we expect that trend to continue in the future. At the same time, our wireless services tend to be a reliable and low cost communication alternative when budgets are constrained and therefore paging services can be positioned well against other communication tools. Our software services leverage these trends with more advanced critical messaging offerings such as our Sp\u014dk Mobile offering for smart phones, which enables caregivers and physicians to communicate more effectively. The trend toward more advanced/smart communications devices has been ongoing in large enterprise and is emerging in the healthcare and government sectors.\nThe following tables present wireless and software revenue by key market segments for the periods stated and illustrate the relative significance of these market segments to our operations.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Segment\n</td> <td>Wireless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Wireless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government\n</td> <td>7,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Large enterprise\n</td> <td>11,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1)\n</td> <td>10,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Direct\n</td> <td>115,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Indirect\n</td> <td>3,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Other includes hospitality, resort and billable travel revenue.

Our most significant expenses are related to employee compensation, cost of sales, site rents, telecommunications and transactional taxes.\nWireless Revenue\nWe provide one-way and advanced two-way wireless messaging services including information services throughout the United States. We provide wireless messaging services to subscribers for a periodic fee. In addition, subscribers either lease a messaging device from us for an additional fixed monthly fee or they own a device, having purchased it either from us or from another vendor (\"direct\"). We also sell devices to resellers who lease or resell devices to their subscribers and then sell messaging services utilizing our networks (\"indirect\"). We also offer ancillary services, such as voice mail and equipment loss and/or maintenance protection to both one-way and two-way messaging subscribers. We market and distribute these wireless messaging and information services through a direct sales force and a small indirect sales channel. (See Item 1. Business\u201d for more details.)\nWireless revenue consists of two primary components: paging revenue and product and other revenue.

Such fees are not generally dependent on usage. As long as a subscriber maintains service, operating results benefit from recurring payment of these fees.\nWireless revenue is generally based upon the number of units in service and the monthly charge per unit. The number of units in service changes based on subscribers added, referred to as gross placements, less subscriber cancellations, or disconnects. The net of gross placements and disconnects is commonly referred to as net gains or losses of units in service or net disconnect rate. The absolute number of gross placements as well as the number of gross placements relative to average units in service in a period, referred to as the gross placement rate, is monitored on a monthly basis. Disconnects are also monitored on a monthly basis. The ratio of units disconnected in a period to average units in service for the same period, called the disconnect rate, is an indicator of our success at retaining subscribers, which is important in order to maintain recurring revenue and to control operating expenses.\nThe following table sets forth our gross placements and disconnects for the periods stated:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td>

As previously discussed, the monthly charge per unit is dependent on the subscriber's service, extent of geographic coverage, whether the subscriber leases or owns the messaging device, and the number of units the customer has in the account. The ratio of revenue for a period to the average units in service, for the same period, commonly referred to as average revenue per unit (\"ARPU\"), is a key revenue measurement as it indicates whether charges for similar services and distribution channels are increasing or decreasing. ARPU by distribution channel and messaging service are monitored regularly.\nThe following table sets forth ARPU by distribution channel for the periods stated:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>ARPU For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution Channel\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indirect\n</td> <td>6.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>7.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile ARPU for similar services and distribution channels is indicative of changes in monthly charges and the revenue rate applicable to new subscribers, this measurement on a consolidated basis is affected by several factors, including the mix of units in service and the pricing of the various components of our services. We expect future sequential annual revenues to decline in line with recent trends. The change in ARPU in the direct distribution channel is the most significant indicator of rate-related changes in our revenue. The decrease in consolidated ARPU during the years 2013 through 2015 was due to the change in composition of our customer base as the percentage of units in service attributable to larger customers continues to increase. These larger customers benefit from lower pricing associated with their larger number of units-in-service. We believe that without further price adjustments, ARPU would trend lower for both the direct and indirect distribution channels in 2016. Price increases could mitigate, but not completely offset, the expected declines in both ARPU and revenue.\nThe following table sets forth information on direct ARPU by account size for the periods stated:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Account Size\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 to 3 units\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4 to 10 units\n</td> <td>14.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>11 to 50 units\n</td> <td>12.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>51 to 100 units\n</td> <td>10.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>101 to 1000 units\n</td> <td>8.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 1000 units\n</td> <td>6.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total direct ARPU\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware Revenue\nWe enter into agreements whereby our customers purchase products and services including software, professional services (primarily installation and training), equipment (to be used in conjunction with the software), and maintenance support (post-contract support). The software is licensed to end-users under an industry standard software license agreement.\nSoftware revenue consists of two primary components: operations revenue and maintenance revenue.\nOperations revenue consists of subscription services revenue, software license revenue, professional services revenue, and equipment sales. Maintenance revenue is for ongoing support of a software application or equipment (typically for one year). We recognize equipment revenue when it is shipped or delivered to the customer depending on delivery method of Free on Board (\"FOB\") shipping or FOB destination, respectively. As of January 1, 2014, license, professional services and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the longer of the period of professional services delivery to the customer or the contractual term of the maintenance agreement. If the period of delivery to the customer is not known, license and professional services revenue will be recognized when software and professional services are fully delivered to the customer and maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining contractual term of the maintenance agreement. Prior to January 1, 2014, license and professional services revenue was recognized when the services were fully delivered to the customer and maintenance revenue was recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement. After the initial maintenance term, customers typically renew their maintenance support. The maintenance renewal rates for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 99.7%, 99.5% and 99.1%, respectively.\nThe breakout of revenue by component was as follows for the periods stated:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>821\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License\n</td> <td>9,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services\n</td> <td>18,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment\n</td> <td>5,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operations revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance revenue\n</td> <td>34,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a regular basis, we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers to provide software licenses, professional services, and equipment. In addition, we enter into contractual arrangements for maintenance with our customers on new solutions or renewals on existing solutions. These contractual arrangements are reported as bookings and represent future revenue. Bookings decreased by 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease primarily reflects slower growth than planned in our international sales. We currently plan to continue expansion in the European, Middle Eastern, Australian and Asia Pacific markets in 2016.\nThe following table summarizes total bookings for the periods stated:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bookings\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operations and new maintenance orders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance and subscription renewals\n</td> <td>35,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total bookings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperations and new maintenance orders in 2014 reflect $6.7 million of one-time bookings related to a U.S. government entity.

Certain of our functional categories are especially important to overall expense control and management. These operating expenses are categorized as follows:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of revenue. These are expenses primarily for hardware, third-party software, outside service expenses and payroll and related expenses for our professional services, logistics, customer support and maintenance staff.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Service, rental and maintenance.

These are expenses associated with information technology and administrative functions. This classification consists primarily of payroll and related expenses, outside service expenses, taxes, licenses and permit expenses, and facility rent expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We review the percentages of these operating expenses to revenue on a regular basis. Even though the operating expenses are classified as described above, expense control and management are also performed by expense category. Approximately 75% of the operating expenses referred to above were incurred in payroll and related expenses, cost of sales, site and facility rent expenses and telecommunication expenses for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Payroll and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included an expense of $0.3 million due to a change in the service period under the 2015 LTIP associated with the departure of a former executive.\nOur largest expense, payroll and related expenses, includes wages, commissions, incentives, employee benefits and related\ntaxes. On a monthly basis, we review the number of employees in major functional categories and the design and physical locations of functional groups to continuously improve efficiency, to simplify organizational structures, and to minimize the number of physical locations for the Company. We have 600 full-time equivalent employees ( FTEs\u201d) at December 31, 2015, an increase of 2.2% from 587 FTEs at December 31, 2014. The increase in the number of FTEs reflects the additional headcount associated with our software revenues.\nCost of sales includes distribution costs for equipment and products sold and/or licensed, operating costs related to product implementation, training, and product support services, and costs associated with the delivery of third party implementation services and third party license, and/or maintenance support.\nSite rent expenses for transmitter locations are largely dependent on our paging networks. We operate local, regional, and nationwide one-way and two-way paging networks. These networks each require locations on which to place transmitters, receivers, and antennae. Site rent expenses for transmitter locations are highly dependent on the number of transmitters, which in turn is dependent on the number of networks. In addition, these expenses generally do not vary directly with the number of subscribers or units in service, which is detrimental to our operating margins as revenue declines. In order to reduce these expenses, we have an active program to consolidate the number of paging networks, and thus transmitter locations, which we refer to as network rationalization. We have reduced the number of active transmitters by 2.2% to 4,243 active transmitters at December 31, 2015 from 4,339 active transmitters at December 31, 2014.\nTelecommunication expenses are incurred to interconnect our paging networks and to provide telephone numbers for customer use, points of contact for customer service, and connectivity among our offices. These expenses are dependent on the number of units in service, the number of customers we support and the number of office and network locations that we maintain. However, the number or duration of telephone calls to call centers may vary from period to period based on factors other than the number of units in service or customers, which could cause telecommunication expenses to vary.\nDue to the integration of the management structure and consolidation of our organization effective January 1, 2014, certain prior years' interim revenue and operating expenses were reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. In 2014, we reported wireless and software revenue, and had reclassified the revenue previously reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2013 (the \"2013 Form 10-K\") to conform with the current year's presentation. In 2013, wireless revenue of $149.45 million was reported as $143.63 million in service, rental and maintenance, net of service credits, and $5.82 million in software revenue and other, net. Also in 2013, software revenue of $60.30 million was reported in software revenue and other, net. We reclassified payroll and related expenses among functional departments and eliminated general and administrative overhead expenses previously allocated to cost of revenue, service, rental and maintenance and selling and marketing. The reclassifications resulted in the following increases and (decreases) to the 2013 Form 10-K reported operating expenses: Cost of revenue of $5.79 million; service, rental and maintenance of ($3.17) million; selling and marketing of $0.53 million; and general and administrative of ($3.15) million. The changes had no impact to previously reported total operating expenses and operating income.\nStatements of Income\nComparison of the Statements of Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Between 2015 and 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wireless\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,388\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software\n</td> <td>70,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service, rental and maintenance\n</td> <td>44,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,084\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>27,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,567\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>42,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,737\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance and restructuring\n</td> <td>2,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,887\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FTEs\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Active transmitters\n</td> <td>4,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(96\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue - Wireless\nOur wireless revenue was $119.0 million and $132.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in wireless revenue of $13.4 million or 10.1% reflects the decrease in demand for our wireless services. Wireless revenue includes paging revenue, product revenue and other revenue. Paging revenue consists primarily of recurring fees associated with the provision of messaging services and rental of leased units and is net of a provision for service credits. Product and other revenue reflects system sales, the sale of devices and charges for leased devices that are not returned and are net of anticipated credits.

In addition, ARPU continues to decline as more customers move to fixed rate plans and new subscribers receive lower monthly rates.\nRevenue - Software\nOur software revenue was $70.6 million and $67.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which consisted of operations revenue (from licenses, subscriptions, professional services and equipment sales) and maintenance revenue.

The decrease in operations revenue of 2.4% primarily reflects lower sales of software to new customers, which was reflected in the decrease of 13.1% in license revenue. The Company has addressed this decrease in software operations revenue by reorganizing its salesforce and territories and replacing lower performing sales employees with new staff. The Company is unable to predict the timing and impact of these changes on its software operations and bookings in 2016.\nThe increase in maintenance revenue reflects our continuing success in renewals of our maintenance support for existing software solutions, the impact of price increases at renewal and in maintenance support for sales of new solutions. The maintenance renewal rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 99.7% and 99.5%, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of revenue.

Selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of payroll and related expenses, which decreased $1.0 million due to lower average payroll and related expenses for sales staff selling software solutions.\nThe sales and marketing staff are involved in selling our communication solutions domestically and internationally. These\nexpenses support our efforts to maintain gross placements of units in service, which mitigated the impact of disconnects on our wireless revenue base, and to identify business opportunities for additional or future software sales. We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our products and vertical sales efforts by strengthening our brand, generating sales leads\nand facilitating the sales process. These marketing functions are accomplished through targeted email campaigns, webinars, regional and national user conferences, monthly newsletters and participation at industry trade shows.\nCommission expenses decreased by $1.2 million due primarily to the impact of a change in the commission plan incentives, which lowered the commission paid on the sale of certain products and a decrease in software operations revenue in 2015. Commission expense is recognized when the underlying revenue from the sales order is recognized.\nAs noted above, the Company has addressed the lower software operations revenue with a reorganization of its salesforce and territories along with the replacement of lower performing sales employees with new staff. The Company has also adjusted its commission plans to focus staff on selling software to new customers to increase software license revenue. The Company is unable to predict the timing and impact of these changes on its software operations bookings and revenue in 2016.\nStock based compensation expenses decreased by $0.4 million due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for grants under the 2015 LTIP.

Severance and restructuring expenses increased to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2014. Approximately $1.8 million was due to charges related to the departure of two executives during the year ended December 31, 2015. Charges recorded for other planned staffing reductions remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. We accrued post-employment benefits if certain specified criteria are met. Post-employment benefits include salary continuation, severance benefits and continuation of health insurance benefits. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our severance and restructuring policies.)\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses were $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $16.7 million for the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to $1.6 million in lower depreciation expense for the period for non-paging device assets and $1.0 million in lower amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the change in the useful life of Amcom related intangibles due to our rebranding in 2014, net of $0.1 million in other changes. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our depreciation expense policies.)\nInterest expense, net, Other income, net and Income tax expense\nInterest expense, net. There was no interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, which represents a decrease of $0.5 million for the same period in 2014. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to recognition of the remaining deferred financing costs associated with the revolving credit facility, which was terminated on December 15, 2014. (See Note 4).\nOther income, net. Net other income was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net other expense of $0.4 million for the same period in 2014. The other income, net consisted primarily of income related to the sale of two land parcels of $0.8 million and $0.3 million related to dividend income.\nIncome tax expense (benefit). The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $57.9 million as compared to a net income tax expense of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The income tax benefit in 2015 was the result of a $68.4 million reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the period (See Note 6 for further discussion on our income taxes). The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was (220.3%), which was a decrease of 244.4% from the December 31, 2014 effective tax rate of 24.1%.\nThe following is the effective tax rate reconciliation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

$132.4 million and $149.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in wireless revenue reflected the decrease in demand for our wireless services. Wireless revenue includes paging revenue, product revenue and other revenue. Paging revenue consists primarily of recurring fees associated with the provision of messaging services and rental of leased units and is net of a provision for service credits. Product and other revenue reflects system sales, the sale of devices and charges for leased devices that are not returned and are net of anticipated credits.

These\nexpenses support our efforts to maintain gross placements of units in service, which mitigated the impact of disconnects on our wireless revenue base, and to identify business opportunities for additional or future software sales. We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our products and vertical sales efforts by strengthening our brand, generating sales leads and facilitating the sales process. These marketing functions are accomplished through targeted email campaigns, webinars, regional and national user conferences, monthly newsletters and participation at industry trade shows.\nCommission expenses increased by $2.1 million due primarily to an increase in software sales and the impact of commission plan incentives for increased sales. Commission expense is recognized as the revenue from the underlying sales order is recognized.\nStock based compensation expenses increased by $0.2 million due primarily to higher amortization of compensation expense for grants under the 2011 LTIP.\nOther expenses increased by $0.5 million due primarily to one-time advertising and related expenses of $0.7 million associated with the company re-branding to the name SP\u014cK in 2014, partially offset by reductions in various other expenses, net of $0.2 million.\nGeneral and administrative.

Severance and restructuring expenses increased to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.0 million for the same period in 2013 due primarily to higher severance charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 for post-employment benefits resulting from planned staffing reductions. We accrued post-employment benefits if certain specified criteria are met. Post-employment benefits include salary continuation, severance benefits and continuation of health insurance benefits. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our severance and restructuring policies.)\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses were $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $15.2 million for the same period in 2013. The increase was primarily due to $0.9 million in higher depreciation expense for the period for non-paging device assets and $0.8 million in higher amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the change in the useful life of Amcom related intangibles due to our rebranding, net of $0.2 million in other changes. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our depreciation expense policies.)\nInterest expense, net, Other income, net and Income tax expense\nInterest expense, net. Net interest expense increased to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.3 million for the same period in 2013. This increase was primarily due to recognition of remaining deferred financing costs associated with the revolving credit facility, which was terminated on December 15, 2014. (See Note 4).\nOther expense, net. Net other expense increased to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from net other income of $0.1 million for the same period in 2013. The increase in net other expense in 2014 was primarily due to a settlement for the closure of a facility of $0.3 million, an incentive plan buyout of $0.1 million and higher financial services fees of $0.1 million in 2014.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $6.6 million, a decrease of $11.2 million from the prior year's income tax expense of $17.8 million. The decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate was largely due to a reduction of income before tax of $18.0 million and a release of the deferred tax assets (\"DTA\") Valuation Allowance of $5.1 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 24.1%, which was a decrease of 15.2% from the December 31, 2013 effective tax rate of 39.3%.\nThe following is the effective tax rate reconciliation for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third-party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. Cash held in these accounts is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third-party financial institutions. These funds invest in direct obligations of the government of the United States. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nAt any point in time, we have approximately $7.0 to $12.0 million in our operating accounts that are with third-party financial institutions. While we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts.\nWe intend to use our cash on hand to provide working capital, to support operations, and to return value to stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock. We may also consider using cash to invest in our operations or fund acquisitions of assets of other businesses that we believe will provide a measure of growth or revenue stability while supporting our operating structure.\nOverview\nIn the event that net cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand are not sufficient to meet future cash requirements, we may be required to reduce planned capital expenses, reduce or eliminate our cash dividends to stockholders, reduce or eliminate our common stock repurchase program, and/or sell assets or seek additional financing. We can provide no assurance that reductions in planned capital expenses or proceeds from asset sales would be sufficient to cover shortfalls in available cash or that additional financing would be available on acceptable terms. As of December 31, 2015, our available cash on hand was $111.3 million.\nBased on current and anticipated levels of operations, we anticipate net cash provided by operating activities, together with the available cash on hand at December 31, 2015, should be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table sets forth information on our net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods stated:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Between 2015 and 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(5,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,614\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(28,984\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,312\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,833\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

The following table includes the cash receipt and expenditure components of our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated, and sets forth the change between the stated periods:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Between 2015 and 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash received from customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid for\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll and related costs\n</td> <td>81,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Site rent costs\n</td> <td>15,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Telecommunications costs\n</td> <td>6,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,339\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest costs\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating costs\n</td> <td>52,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>575\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>156,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to a decrease in cash received from customers of $0.7 million, an an increase in cash paid for operating expenses of $2.8 million. Cash received from customers consisted of revenue and direct taxes billed to customers adjusted for changes in accounts receivable, deferred revenue and tax withholding amounts. The decrease of $0.7 million was due to lower\nrevenue of $10.6 million off-set by higher collection of accounts receivable of $9.2 million and a net increase of $0.7 million in deferred revenue, customer deposits, and other.\nThe increase in cash paid for operating expenses of $2.8 million was as follows:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash payments for payroll and related costs increased by $4.4 million primarily due to high headcount and an additional pay period resulting in high payroll and related payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash payments for site rent costs decreased $0.7 million.

The increase was due primarily to a decrease in accounts payable of $0.7 million off set by a decrease of $0.4 million in inventory purchases to support software sales and a net $0.3 million increase in payments for other expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to lower capital expenses for property and equipment of $1.3 million and an increase in the proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the same period in 2014.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the same period in 2014 due to stock repurchases of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, we paid $3.1 million more in cash dividends to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, which includes $0.6 million in dividends paid on the vested RSUs issued under the 2011 LTIP in 2015.\nCash Dividends to Stockholders. For the year ended on December 31, 2015, we paid a total of $13.3 million (or $0.625 per share of common stock) in quarterly cash dividends and special dividend compared to $10.8 million (or $0.50 per share of common stock) in quarterly cash dividends for the same period in 2014.\nFuture Cash Dividends to Stockholders. On February 24, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock, with a record date of March 18, 2016, and a payment date of March 30, 2016. This cash dividend of approximately $2.6 million will be paid from available cash on hand.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program. On July 31, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase our common stock in the open market. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC administers such purchases. We expect to use available cash on hand and net cash provided by operating activities to fund the common stock repurchase program.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased 897,117 shares of our common stock under the repurchase program for $15.0 million. The Company's stock repurchase program has been extended at various dates between 2009 through 2015 by our Board of Directors. The available repurchase authority is $10.0 million as of January 4, 2016 and expires on December 31, 2016. This repurchase authority allows us, at management's discretion, to selectively repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market depending upon market price and other factors. (See Note 5 for further discussion on our common stock repurchase program.)\nBorrowings. On November 8, 2011 we executed the First Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ( Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC ( Wells Fargo\u201d). The Amended Credit Agreement increased the amount of the revolving credit facility to $40.0 million. The maturity date for the revolving credit facility was September 3, 2015. The Amended Credit Agreement also revised the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) definition to eliminate the LIBOR floor and reduced the interest rate margin to 3.25%. Borrowings under this facility were secured by a lien on substantially all of the existing assets, interests in assets and proceeds owned or acquired by us. We were subject to certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement. These financial covenants consisted of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.\nOn December 15, 2014, we terminated the Amended Credit Agreement and underlying revolving credit facility. At the time the revolving credit facility was terminated, we were in compliance with all the required financial covenants and did not incur any early termination penalties. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding debt. (See Note 4 for further discussion on our long-term debt.)\nCommitments and Contingencies\nContractual Obligations. As of December 31, 2015, our contractual payment obligations under our operating leases for office and transmitter locations are indicated in the table below. For purposes of the table below, purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable pricing provisions; and the approximate timing of transactions. These purchase obligations primarily relate to certain telecommunication and information technology expenses. The amounts are based on our contractual commitments; however, it is possible that we may be able to negotiate lower payments if we choose to exit these contracts before their expiration date. Other obligations as indicated below consisted primarily of expected future payments for asset retirements and cumulative dividends primarily under the 2015 LTIP payable to certain eligible employees.\nThe following table provides the Company's significant commitments and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>12,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations\n</td> <td>9,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Commitments and Contingencies. See Note 7 for further discussion on other commitments and contingencies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\nRelated Parties\nSee Note 15 for further discussion on our related party transactions.\nInflation\nInflation has not had a material effect on our operations to date. System equipment and operating costs have not significantly increased in price, and the price of wireless messaging devices has tended to decline in recent years. This reduction in costs has generally been reflected in lower prices charged to subscribers who purchase their wireless messaging devices. Our general operating expenses, such as salaries, site rent for transmitter locations, employee benefits and occupancy costs, are subject to normal inflationary pressures.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preceding discussion and analysis of financial condition and statement of income is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to those related to the impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization and goodwill, accounts receivable allowances, revenue recognition, asset retirement obligations, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or condition.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Goodwill\nWe are required to evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill. Amortizable intangible assets include customer related intangibles, technology based intangibles, contract based intangibles and\nmarketing intangibles that primarily resulted from our previous acquisitions. Such intangibles are being amortized over periods up to ten years. Quarterly, we assess whether circumstances exist which suggest that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When applicable, we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets and certain amortizable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. In assessing the recoverability of these assets, we forecasted estimated enterprise-level cash flows based on operating assumptions such as revenue forecasted by product line. If the forecast of undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying value of the long-lived assets, we would record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value exceeded the fair value of such assets.\nGoodwill resulting from our acquisitions is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or when events or circumstances suggest a potential impairment has occurred. We performed this annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2015. We evaluate goodwill for impairment between annual tests if indicators of impairment exist. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we compare the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the implied fair value is less than the carrying value of the goodwill, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss. For purposes of the goodwill impairment evaluation, the Company as a whole is considered the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated under a market based approach using the fair value of the Company's common stock. A confirmatory discounted cash flow analysis is also used to assess whether impairment exists. This calculation requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nWe did not record any impairment of long-lived assets, definite lived intangible assets or goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nAccounts Receivable Allowances\nOur two most significant allowance accounts are an allowance for doubtful accounts and an allowance for service credits. Provisions for these allowances are recorded on a monthly basis and are included as a component of general and administrative expenses and a reduction of revenue, respectively.\nEstimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on historical collection experience and current and forecasted trends. In determining these percentages, we review historical write-offs, including comparisons of write-offs to provisions for doubtful accounts and as a percentage of revenues. We compare the ratio of the allowance to gross receivables to historical levels, and monitor amounts collected and related statistics. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.6 million,$0.7 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We write off receivables when they are deemed uncollectible. While write-offs of customer accounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that our future write-off experience will be consistent with historical experience, which could result in material differences in the allowance for doubtful accounts and related provisions.\nThe allowance for service credits and maintenance related provisions is based on historical credit percentages, current credit and aging trends, historical actual payment trends and actual credit experience. We analyze our past credit experience over several time frames. Using this analysis along with current operational data including existing experience of credits issued and the time frames in which credits are issued, we establish an appropriate allowance for service credits. The allowance for service credits was $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This allowance reduces accounts receivable for lost and non-returned pagers to the expected realizable amounts and for free wireless services. In addition, this allowance reduces software maintenance revenue. While credits issued have been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that future credit experience will be consistent with historical experience, which could result in material differences in the allowance for service credits and maintenance related provisions.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when four basic criteria have been met:\n\u2022there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;\n\u2022delivery has occurred or services rendered;\n\u2022the fee is fixed or determinable; and\n\u2022collectability is reasonably assured.\nAmounts billed to customers, but not meeting the above revenue recognition criteria are deferred until all four criteria have been met.\nSigned agreements are used as evidence of an arrangement. If a contract signed by the customer does not exist, we use a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. If both a signed contract and a purchase order exist, we consider the signed contract to be the final persuasive evidence of an arrangement. At the time a contract is executed, we evaluate the contract to assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable. If the fee is assessed as not being fixed or determinable, revenue recognition is delayed until this assessment can be made. Additionally, we review customer creditworthiness and our historical ability to collect payments due.\nOur wireless revenue consists primarily of service, rental and maintenance fees charged to customers on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Revenue also includes the sale of messaging devices directly to customers and other companies that resell our services. With respect to revenue recognition for multiple deliverables, we evaluated these revenue arrangements and determined that two separate units of accounting exist, paging service revenue and product sales. We recognize paging service revenue over the period the service is performed; revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment or installation. We have a variety of billing arrangements with our customers resulting in deferred revenue from advance billings and accounts receivables for billing in-arrears arrangements.\nOur software revenue consists primarily of the sale of software (license fees), professional services (primarily installation and training), equipment (to be used in conjunction with the software) and maintenance support (post-contract support). The software is licensed to end users under an industry standard software license agreement. Our software products are considered to be off-the-shelf software\u201d as the software is marketed as a stock item that customers can use without customization.\nSoftware revenue consists of two primary components: (1) operations revenue consisting of software license revenue, professional services revenue and equipment sales, and (2) maintenance revenue.\nWe generally sell software licenses, professional services, equipment and maintenance in multiple-element arrangements. At inception of the arrangement, we allocate the arrangement consideration to the software deliverables (software licenses, professional services and maintenance) as a group and to the non-software deliverables (equipment and maintenance on equipment, when applicable) using the relative selling price method. When performing this allocation, the estimated selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE\u201d), third party evidence of fair value ( TPE\u201d), or if VSOE and TPE are not available, the best estimated selling price ( BESP\u201d) for selling the element on a stand-alone basis. We have determined that TPE is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.\nOur standard post contract support (maintenance) is allocated using VSOE as an input in the relative selling price allocation. For software licenses, professional services, equipment and premium maintenance we have determined that neither VSOE nor TPE is available and as such, we have used BESP as an input in order to allocate our arrangement fees. We determine BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices take into consideration our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.\nIn multiple-element arrangements, the arrangement consideration allocated to our non-software deliverables (equipment) is generally recognized upon shipment or delivery to the customer depending on delivery method of Free on Board (\"FOB\") shipping or FOB destination, respectively.\nFor our software deliverables, which include software licenses, professional services, and post contract support (maintenance), we further allocate arrangement consideration using the residual method. As noted above, we have not established VSOE for our software licenses, professional services and premium maintenance. However, we have established, and continue to maintain, VSOE for our standard post contract support (maintenance). We recognize contract revenue ratably over the longer of the estimated services delivery period or the maintenance term. If delivery of the software and services is completed before the end of the maintenance period, then the remaining deferred revenue associated with these elements is recognized in full at this time. Any unrecognized revenue related to maintenance continues to be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the maintenance period. If the period of delivery to the customer is not known, license and professional services revenue will be recognized when software and professional services are fully delivered to the customer and the maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining contractual term of the agreement. Prior to January 1, 2014, we did not have a method for reasonably estimating the services period and therefore, license and professional services revenue was primarily recognized at the time of full delivery. In 2014, we developed a methodology for reasonably estimating the services period and have been able to recognize license and professional services revenue ratably on most contracts. Generally, the defined services period for most of our projects is shorter than the maintenance term.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize liabilities and corresponding assets for future obligations associated with the retirement of assets. We have paging equipment assets, principally transmitters, which are located on leased locations. The underlying leases generally require the removal of equipment at the end of the lease term; therefore, a future obligation exists.\nAsset retirement costs are reflected in paging equipment assets with depreciation expense recognized over the estimated lives, which range between one and five years. The asset retirement costs were $3.6 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net increase in asset retirement costs in 2015 is related to the revised deconstruction forecast during the period. Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included benefits of $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, related to depreciation of these asset retirement costs.The benefits in depreciation expense for these years are due to net reductions to the asset retirement costs as a result of changes in the timing and costs of the transmitter deconstructions. The asset retirement costs and the corresponding liabilities that have been recorded to date generally relate to either current plans to consolidate networks or to the removal of assets at a future terminal date.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, accrued other liabilities included $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of asset retirement liabilities related to our efforts to reduce the number of transmitters in operation; other long-term liabilities included $7.5 million and $6.8 million, respectively, related primarily to an estimate of the costs of deconstructing assets through the terminal date. The primary variables associated with these estimates are the number of transmitters and related equipment to be removed, the timing of removal, and a fair value estimate of the outside contractor fees to remove each asset. The fair value estimate of contractor fees to remove each asset is assumed to escalate by 4% each year through the terminal date.\nThe cost associated with the estimated removal costs and timing refinements due to ongoing network rationalization activities will accrete to a total liability of $9.3 million. The accretion was recorded on the interest method utilizing the following discount rates for the specified periods:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period\n</td> <td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 - January 1 through December 31 - Additions(1)\n</td> <td>11.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 - December 31 - Incremental Estimates(2)\n</td> <td>10.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014 - January 1 through December 31 - Additions(1)\n</td> <td>10.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014 - December 31 - Incremental Estimates(2)\n</td> <td>12.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013 - December 31 Additions(1) and Incremental Estimates\n</td> <td>10.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013 - January 1 through September 30 - Additions(1)\n</td> <td>10.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Transmitters moved to new sites resulting in additional liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Weighted average credit adjusted risk-free rate used to discount downward revision to estimated future cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The total estimated liability is based on transmitter locations remaining after we have consolidated the number of networks we operate and assume the underlying leases continue to be renewed to that future date. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $0.7 million, $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for accretion expense on the asset retirement obligation liabilities.\nWe believe these estimates are reasonable at the present time, but we can give no assurance that changes in technology, our financial condition, the economy or other factors would not result in higher or lower asset retirement obligations. Any variations from our estimates would generally result in a change in the assets and liabilities in equal amounts, and operating results would differ in the future by any difference in depreciation expense and accretion expense.\nIncome Taxes - Uncertainties and Deferred Income Tax Assets (\"DTAs\")\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of tax-related assets, liabilities and income tax expense. These estimates and assumptions are based on the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d). The ASC includes provisions relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.\nWe file our income tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are required to evaluate the recoverability of our DTAs. The assessment is to determine whether based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than a 50% probability) that all or some portion of the DTAs will be realized in the future.\nThe DTA valuation allowance reflects management's judgment concerning the ultimate recoverability of the DTAs. As of December 31, 2015, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the net DTAs of $84.0 million will be recoverable. Approximately 85.0% of our net DTAs consist of net operating loss carryforwards. For the three years ended December 31, 2014,\nthe Company has utilized approximately $121.7 million of net operating losses which translates into approximately $48.5 million of DTAs and we expect to utilize $26.4 million of NOLs for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe consider both positive and negative evidence when evaluating the recoverability of our DTAs. During the fourth quarter of each year, we prepare a multi-year forecast of taxable income for our operations. In preparing our analysis of the recoverability of our DTAs, we consider the following possible sources of taxable income:\n1. Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.\nWe consider 100% of our existing taxable temporary differences when estimating the amount of recoverable DTAs. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $5.5 million of taxable temporary differences which we believe will be recoverable over the next 20 year carryforward period. Most of these differences relate to software intangible assets that have a 15 year recovery period.\n2. Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nAs described above, we use a multi-year forecast of taxable income for the Company. DTAs are realizable if future deductible amounts would reduce taxes that would be paid on future taxable income excluding the reversal of existing temporary differences.\n3. Taxable income in carryback years to the extent permitted by tax law.\nWe have exhausted our carryback potential and now only have carryforwards available.\n4. Tax planning strategies.\nSince 2012, we elected to capitalize and amortize over 10 years, software research and development costs. In the near term, this has the effect of increasing taxable income and the amount of net operating losses utilized.\nThe balance of the DTA valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $45.8 million and $114.2 million, respectively. The estimated recoverable DTAs at December 31, 2015 totaled $84.0 million and at December 31, 2014 was $24.1 million. These estimated recoverable amounts represent approximately 64.7% and 17.5%, respectively, of the total DTAs before the valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRecent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Since the ASU was issued, the FASB has issued several changes, most notably in July 2015, which delayed the effective date. Our effective date is January 1, 2018 and while early adoption to the original effective date of January 1, 2017 is permitted, we have elected not to early adopt.\nASU No. 2014-09 creates a five-step model that requires companies to exercise judgment when considering all relevant facts and circumstances in the determination of when and how revenue is recognized. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We have not selected a transition method. We continue to evaluate the potential impact from this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which was issued as part of the FASB's simplification initiative, which has an objective of identifying areas of GAAP that can be simplified for the purpose of reducing an entity's costs while continuing to provide useful information to financial statement users. ASU 2015-17 allows entities to classify deferred tax assets or liabilities as non-current rather than splitting the balance between a current and non-current balance. Entities may apply this new guidance prospectively or retrospectively when adopting this standard.\nThe effective date is January 1, 2017, however, early adoption of the standard is effective immediately. We have decided to early adopt this guidance and have classified our DTA as non-current at December, 31, 2015. Early adoption did not have a material impact on our overall financial statements and does not alter our overall financial results. We applied the guidance retrospectively for the purposes of providing comparable financial statement results. Retrospective application of this standard resulted in a\nreclassification of the current DTAs of $2.2 million, net of the valuation allowance to a non-current asset in our balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 2014. Retrospective application had no other financial statement impact.\nThe FASB is expected to issue an ASU on the accounting for leases in the first quarter of 2016. The new standard is expected to establish a right of use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either financing or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.\nThe new ASU is expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is expected to be required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. While we are still evaluating the impact of the potential new standard on our consolidated financial statements, we expect that upon adoption we will recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities and that the amounts could be material.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use a non-GAAP financial measure as a key element in determining performance for purposes of incentive compensation under our annual Short-Term Incentive Plan (\"STIP\"). That non-GAAP financial measure is operating cash flow ( OCF\u201d), defined as EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment (EBITDA is defined as operating income plus depreciation, amortization, accretion and impairment, each determined in accordance with GAAP). Purchases of property and equipment are also determined in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of STIP performance, OCF was as follows for the periods stated:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Depreciation, amortization, accretion and impairment\n</td> <td>13,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA (as defined by the Company)\n</td> <td>39,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(6,374\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,679\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,408\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OCF (as defined by the Company)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND STATEMENT OF\nINCOME\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the discussion under Application of Critical Accounting Policies\u201d (also under Item 7), which describes key estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements; Item 1. Business,\u201d which describes our operations; and Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d which describes key risks associated with our operations and markets in which we operate. A reference to a Note\u201d in this section refers to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOverview\nWe offer our communication services and products in the United States and abroad primarily to three major market segments: healthcare, government and large enterprise, but with a greater emphasis on the healthcare market segment. For wireless revenue, the government business has been trending downward over the last several years as state and local governments have been struggling with budget constraints. Large enterprise customers have been trending away from paging to cellular/smart phones for a number of years and we expect that trend to continue in the future. At the same time, our wireless services tend to be a reliable and low cost communication alternative when budgets are constrained and therefore paging services can be positioned well against other communication tools. Our software services leverage these trends with more advanced critical messaging offerings such as our Sp\u014dk Mobile offering for smart phones, which enables caregivers and physicians to communicate more effectively. The trend toward more advanced/smart communications devices has been ongoing in large enterprise and is emerging in the healthcare and government sectors.\nThe following tables present wireless and software revenue by key market segments for the periods stated and illustrate the relative significance of these market segments to our operations.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Segment\n</td> <td>Wireless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Wireless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government\n</td> <td>7,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Large enterprise\n</td> <td>11,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1)\n</td> <td>10,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Direct\n</td> <td>115,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Indirect\n</td> <td>3,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Other includes hospitality, resort and billable travel revenue.

Our most significant expenses are related to employee compensation, cost of sales, site rents, telecommunications and transactional taxes.\nWireless Revenue\nWe provide one-way and advanced two-way wireless messaging services including information services throughout the United States. We provide wireless messaging services to subscribers for a periodic fee. In addition, subscribers either lease a messaging device from us for an additional fixed monthly fee or they own a device, having purchased it either from us or from another vendor (\"direct\"). We also sell devices to resellers who lease or resell devices to their subscribers and then sell messaging services utilizing our networks (\"indirect\"). We also offer ancillary services, such as voice mail and equipment loss and/or maintenance protection to both one-way and two-way messaging subscribers. We market and distribute these wireless messaging and information services through a direct sales force and a small indirect sales channel. (See Item 1. Business\u201d for more details.)\nWireless revenue consists of two primary components: paging revenue and product and other revenue.

Such fees are not generally dependent on usage. As long as a subscriber maintains service, operating results benefit from recurring payment of these fees.\nWireless revenue is generally based upon the number of units in service and the monthly charge per unit. The number of units in service changes based on subscribers added, referred to as gross placements, less subscriber cancellations, or disconnects. The net of gross placements and disconnects is commonly referred to as net gains or losses of units in service or net disconnect rate. The absolute number of gross placements as well as the number of gross placements relative to average units in service in a period, referred to as the gross placement rate, is monitored on a monthly basis. Disconnects are also monitored on a monthly basis. The ratio of units disconnected in a period to average units in service for the same period, called the disconnect rate, is an indicator of our success at retaining subscribers, which is important in order to maintain recurring revenue and to control operating expenses.\nThe following table sets forth our gross placements and disconnects for the periods stated:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td>

As previously discussed, the monthly charge per unit is dependent on the subscriber's service, extent of geographic coverage, whether the subscriber leases or owns the messaging device, and the number of units the customer has in the account. The ratio of revenue for a period to the average units in service, for the same period, commonly referred to as average revenue per unit (\"ARPU\"), is a key revenue measurement as it indicates whether charges for similar services and distribution channels are increasing or decreasing. ARPU by distribution channel and messaging service are monitored regularly.\nThe following table sets forth ARPU by distribution channel for the periods stated:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>ARPU For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution Channel\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indirect\n</td> <td>6.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>7.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile ARPU for similar services and distribution channels is indicative of changes in monthly charges and the revenue rate applicable to new subscribers, this measurement on a consolidated basis is affected by several factors, including the mix of units in service and the pricing of the various components of our services. We expect future sequential annual revenues to decline in line with recent trends. The change in ARPU in the direct distribution channel is the most significant indicator of rate-related changes in our revenue. The decrease in consolidated ARPU during the years 2013 through 2015 was due to the change in composition of our customer base as the percentage of units in service attributable to larger customers continues to increase. These larger customers benefit from lower pricing associated with their larger number of units-in-service. We believe that without further price adjustments, ARPU would trend lower for both the direct and indirect distribution channels in 2016. Price increases could mitigate, but not completely offset, the expected declines in both ARPU and revenue.\nThe following table sets forth information on direct ARPU by account size for the periods stated:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Account Size\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 to 3 units\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4 to 10 units\n</td> <td>14.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>11 to 50 units\n</td> <td>12.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>51 to 100 units\n</td> <td>10.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>101 to 1000 units\n</td> <td>8.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 1000 units\n</td> <td>6.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total direct ARPU\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoftware Revenue\nWe enter into agreements whereby our customers purchase products and services including software, professional services (primarily installation and training), equipment (to be used in conjunction with the software), and maintenance support (post-contract support). The software is licensed to end-users under an industry standard software license agreement.\nSoftware revenue consists of two primary components: operations revenue and maintenance revenue.\nOperations revenue consists of subscription services revenue, software license revenue, professional services revenue, and equipment sales. Maintenance revenue is for ongoing support of a software application or equipment (typically for one year). We recognize equipment revenue when it is shipped or delivered to the customer depending on delivery method of Free on Board (\"FOB\") shipping or FOB destination, respectively. As of January 1, 2014, license, professional services and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the longer of the period of professional services delivery to the customer or the contractual term of the maintenance agreement. If the period of delivery to the customer is not known, license and professional services revenue will be recognized when software and professional services are fully delivered to the customer and maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining contractual term of the maintenance agreement. Prior to January 1, 2014, license and professional services revenue was recognized when the services were fully delivered to the customer and maintenance revenue was recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement. After the initial maintenance term, customers typically renew their maintenance support. The maintenance renewal rates for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 99.7%, 99.5% and 99.1%, respectively.\nThe breakout of revenue by component was as follows for the periods stated:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>821\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License\n</td> <td>9,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services\n</td> <td>18,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment\n</td> <td>5,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operations revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance revenue\n</td> <td>34,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a regular basis, we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers to provide software licenses, professional services, and equipment. In addition, we enter into contractual arrangements for maintenance with our customers on new solutions or renewals on existing solutions. These contractual arrangements are reported as bookings and represent future revenue. Bookings decreased by 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.

Certain of our functional categories are especially important to overall expense control and management. These operating expenses are categorized as follows:\n \u2022 Cost of revenue. These are expenses primarily for hardware, third-party software, outside service expenses and payroll and related expenses for our professional services, logistics, customer support and maintenance staff. \n \u2022 Service, rental and maintenance. These are expenses associated with the operation of our paging networks and development of our software. Expenses consist largely of site rent expenses for transmitter locations, telecommunication expenses to deliver messages over our paging networks, and payroll and related expenses for our engineering, pager repair functions and development and maintenance of our software products. \n \u2022 Selling and marketing. These are expenses associated with our direct sales force and indirect sales channel and marketing expenses in support of those sales groups. This classification consists primarily of payroll and related expenses and commission expenses. \n \u2022 General and administrative. These are expenses associated with information technology and administrative functions. This classification consists primarily of payroll and related expenses, outside service expenses, taxes, licenses and permit expenses, and facility rent expenses.  We review the percentages of these operating expenses to revenue on a regular basis. Even though the operating expenses are classified as described above, expense control and management are also performed by expense category. Approximately 75% of the operating expenses referred to above were incurred in payroll and related expenses, cost of sales, site and facility rent expenses and telecommunication expenses for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Payroll and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included an expense of $0.3 million due to a change in the service period under the 2015 LTIP associated with the departure of a former executive.\nOur largest expense, payroll and related expenses, includes wages, commissions, incentives, employee benefits and related\ntaxes. On a monthly basis, we review the number of employees in major functional categories and the design and physical locations of functional groups to continuously improve efficiency, to simplify organizational structures, and to minimize the number of physical locations for the Company. We have 600 full-time equivalent employees ( FTEs\u201d) at December 31, 2015, an increase of 2.2% from 587 FTEs at December 31, 2014. The increase in the number of FTEs reflects the additional headcount associated with our software revenues.\nCost of sales includes distribution costs for equipment and products sold and/or licensed, operating costs related to product implementation, training, and product support services, and costs associated with the delivery of third party implementation services and third party license, and/or maintenance support.\nSite rent expenses for transmitter locations are largely dependent on our paging networks. We operate local, regional, and nationwide one-way and two-way paging networks. These networks each require locations on which to place transmitters, receivers, and antennae. Site rent expenses for transmitter locations are highly dependent on the number of transmitters, which in turn is dependent on the number of networks. In addition, these expenses generally do not vary directly with the number of subscribers or units in service, which is detrimental to our operating margins as revenue declines. In order to reduce these expenses, we have an active program to consolidate the number of paging networks, and thus transmitter locations, which we refer to as network rationalization. We have reduced the number of active transmitters by 2.2% to 4,243 active transmitters at December 31, 2015 from 4,339 active transmitters at December 31, 2014.\nTelecommunication expenses are incurred to interconnect our paging networks and to provide telephone numbers for customer use, points of contact for customer service, and connectivity among our offices. These expenses are dependent on the number of units in service, the number of customers we support and the number of office and network locations that we maintain. However, the number or duration of telephone calls to call centers may vary from period to period based on factors other than the number of units in service or customers, which could cause telecommunication expenses to vary.\nDue to the integration of the management structure and consolidation of our organization effective January 1, 2014, certain prior years' interim revenue and operating expenses were reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. In 2014, we reported wireless and software revenue, and had reclassified the revenue previously reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2013 (the \"2013 Form 10-K\") to conform with the current year's presentation. In 2013, wireless revenue of $149.45 million was reported as $143.63 million in service, rental and maintenance, net of service credits, and $5.82 million in software revenue and other, net. Also in 2013, software revenue of $60.30 million was reported in software revenue and other, net. We reclassified payroll and related expenses among functional departments and eliminated general and administrative overhead expenses previously allocated to cost of revenue, service, rental and maintenance and selling and marketing. The reclassifications resulted in the following increases and (decreases) to the 2013 Form 10-K reported operating expenses: Cost of revenue of $5.79 million; service, rental and maintenance of ($3.17) million; selling and marketing of $0.53 million; and general and administrative of ($3.15) million. The changes had no impact to previously reported total operating expenses and operating income.\nStatements of Income\nComparison of the Statements of Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Between 2015 and 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wireless\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,388\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software\n</td> <td>70,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service, rental and maintenance\n</td> <td>44,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,084\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>27,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,567\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>42,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,737\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance and restructuring\n</td> <td>2,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,887\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FTEs\n</td> <td>600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Active transmitters\n</td> <td>4,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(96\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue - Wireless\nOur wireless revenue was $119.0 million and $132.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in wireless revenue of $13.4 million or 10.1% reflects the decrease in demand for our wireless services. Wireless revenue includes paging revenue, product revenue and other revenue. Paging revenue consists primarily of recurring fees associated with the provision of messaging services and rental of leased units and is net of a provision for service credits. Product and other revenue reflects system sales, the sale of devices and charges for leased devices that are not returned and are net of anticipated credits.

In addition, ARPU continues to decline as more customers move to fixed rate plans and new subscribers receive lower monthly rates.\nRevenue - Software\nOur software revenue was $70.6 million and $67.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which consisted of operations revenue (from licenses, subscriptions, professional services and equipment sales) and maintenance revenue.

The decrease in operations revenue of 2.4% primarily reflects lower sales of software to new customers, which was reflected in the decrease of 13.1% in license revenue. The Company has addressed this decrease in software operations revenue by reorganizing its salesforce and territories and replacing lower performing sales employees with new staff. The Company is unable to predict the timing and impact of these changes on its software operations and bookings in 2016.\nThe increase in maintenance revenue reflects our continuing success in renewals of our maintenance support for existing software solutions, the impact of price increases at renewal and in maintenance support for sales of new solutions. The maintenance renewal rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 99.7% and 99.5%, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of revenue.

Stock based compensation expenses decreased by $0.2 million due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for awards under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\"). (See Note 5).

The increase in payroll and related expenses of $1.0 million was due to six net additional FTEs in product development as compared to the comparable period. \n \u2022 Site rent - The decrease of $0.8 million in site rent expenses was primarily due to the rationalization of our networks, which has decreased the number of transmitters required to provide service to our customers. The reduction in transmitters has, in turn, reduced the number of lease locations. The number of active transmitters declined 2.2% from 2014 to 2015. \n \u2022 Telecommunications - The decrease of $1.5 million in telecommunication expenses was due to the consolidation of our networks. We believe continued reductions in these expenses will occur as our networks continue to be consolidated as anticipated, throughout 2016, and as we reduce our telephone circuit inventory. \n \u2022 Other - The increase of $0.3 million in other expenses was due primarily to higher outside services expense associated with third party product development support.

Selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of payroll and related expenses, which decreased $1.0 million due to lower average payroll and related expenses for sales staff selling software solutions.\nThe sales and marketing staff are involved in selling our communication solutions domestically and internationally. These\nexpenses support our efforts to maintain gross placements of units in service, which mitigated the impact of disconnects on our wireless revenue base, and to identify business opportunities for additional or future software sales. We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our products and vertical sales efforts by strengthening our brand, generating sales leads\nand facilitating the sales process. These marketing functions are accomplished through targeted email campaigns, webinars, regional and national user conferences, monthly newsletters and participation at industry trade shows.\nCommission expenses decreased by $1.2 million due primarily to the impact of a change in the commission plan incentives, which lowered the commission paid on the sale of certain products and a decrease in software operations revenue in 2015. Commission expense is recognized when the underlying revenue from the sales order is recognized.\nAs noted above, the Company has addressed the lower software operations revenue with a reorganization of its salesforce and territories along with the replacement of lower performing sales employees with new staff. The Company has also adjusted its commission plans to focus staff on selling software to new customers to increase software license revenue. The Company is unable to predict the timing and impact of these changes on its software operations bookings and revenue in 2016.\nStock based compensation expenses decreased by $0.4 million due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for grants under the 2015 LTIP.

Payroll and related expenses decreased by $0.4 million reflecting headcount reductions of eleven FTEs to 121 FTEs at December 31, 2015 from 132 FTEs at December 31, 2014 partially off-set by higher average salaries. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with RSUs, common stock awarded to certain eligible employees and amortization of compensation expense for restricted stock awarded to non-executive members of our Board of Directors under the 2012 Equity Incentive Award Plan (\"Equity Plan\"). Stock based compensation expenses decreased by $1.3 million due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for grants under the 2015 LTIP. (See Note 5) \n \u2022 Bad debt - Bad debt expense remained consistent for the year ended December 31, 2015 as we were able to maintain our collection efforts associated with our software revenue. \n \u2022 Outside services - Outside service expenses consisted primarily of professional services fees associated with compliance reporting, taxes and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\") and the printing and mailing of invoices. The $0.2 million increase in outside service expenses was primarily due to higher professional services fees for external accounting and tax support services. \n \u2022 Repairs and maintenance - The decrease of $0.3 million in repairs and maintenance expenses reflects a lower need for third party support by our sales and customer services teams. \n \u2022 Other - The decrease of $1.4 million in other expenses was due primarily to a non-recurring charge of $0.8 million related to future billing credits, and higher relocation expenses and refunds of $0.5 million and net other changes of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which were not incurred during the current year.  Severance and restructuring. Severance and restructuring expenses increased to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2014. Approximately $1.8 million was due to charges related to the departure of two executives during the year ended December 31, 2015. Charges recorded for other planned staffing reductions remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. We accrued post-employment benefits if certain specified criteria are met. Post-employment benefits include salary continuation, severance benefits and continuation of health insurance benefits. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our severance and restructuring policies.)\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses were $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $16.7 million for the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to $1.6 million in lower depreciation expense for the period for non-paging device assets and $1.0 million in lower amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the change in the useful life of Amcom related intangibles due to our rebranding in 2014, net of $0.1 million in other changes. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our depreciation expense policies.)\nInterest expense, net, Other income, net and Income tax expense\nInterest expense, net. There was no interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, which represents a decrease of $0.5 million for the same period in 2014. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to recognition of the remaining deferred financing costs associated with the revolving credit facility, which was terminated on December 15, 2014. (See Note 4).\nOther income, net. Net other income was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net other expense of $0.4 million for the same period in 2014. The other income, net consisted primarily of income related to the sale of two land parcels of $0.8 million and $0.3 million related to dividend income.\nIncome tax expense (benefit). The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $57.9 million as compared to a net income tax expense of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The income tax benefit in 2015 was the result of a $68.4 million reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the period (See Note 6 for further discussion on our income taxes). The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was (220.3%), which was a decrease of 244.4% from the December 31, 2014 effective tax rate of 24.1%.\nThe following is the effective tax rate reconciliation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

$132.4 million and $149.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in wireless revenue reflected the decrease in demand for our wireless services. Wireless revenue includes paging revenue, product revenue and other revenue. Paging revenue consists primarily of recurring fees associated with the provision of messaging services and rental of leased units and is net of a provision for service credits. Product and other revenue reflects system sales, the sale of devices and charges for leased devices that are not returned and are net of anticipated credits.

In addition, ARPU continues to decline as more customers move to fixed rate plans and new subscribers receive lower monthly rates. Price increases could mitigate, but not completely offset, the declines in ARPU and revenue.\nRevenue - Software\nOur software revenue was $67.9 million and $60.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which consisted of operations revenue (from licenses, subscriptions, professional services and equipment sales) and maintenance revenue.

Stock based compensation expenses increased by $0.1 million due primarily to higher amortization of compensation expense for awards under the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\").

The reduction in transmitters has, in turn, reduced the number of lease locations. The number of active transmitters declined 4.4% from 2013 to 2014. \n \u2022 Telecommunications - The decrease of $0.9 million in telecommunication expenses was due to the consolidation of our networks. We believe continued reductions in these expenses will occur as our networks continue to be consolidated as anticipated, throughout 2015, and as we reduce our telephone circuit inventory. \n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred largely for field technicians, their managers, and in-house repair personnel and product development, product strategy and quality assurance personnel. The decrease in payroll and related expenses of $0.5 million was due to a reduction of 7 FTEs as compared to the comparable period. \n \u2022 Other - The increase of $0.4 million in other expenses was due primarily to higher outside services expense associated with temporary help.  Selling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consisted of the following items:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Between 2014 and 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll and related\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions\n</td> <td>8,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock based compensation\n</td> <td>544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>4,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total selling and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FTEs\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs indicated in the table above, selling and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $3.4 million, or 12.8%, from the same period in 2013. Selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of payroll and related expenses, which increased $0.6 million due to higher average payroll and related expenses for sales staff selling software solutions.\nThe sales and marketing staff are involved in selling our communication solutions domestically and internationally. These\nexpenses support our efforts to maintain gross placements of units in service, which mitigated the impact of disconnects on our wireless revenue base, and to identify business opportunities for additional or future software sales. We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our products and vertical sales efforts by strengthening our brand, generating sales leads and facilitating the sales process. These marketing functions are accomplished through targeted email campaigns, webinars, regional and national user conferences, monthly newsletters and participation at industry trade shows.\nCommission expenses increased by $2.1 million due primarily to an increase in software sales and the impact of commission plan incentives for increased sales. Commission expense is recognized as the revenue from the underlying sales order is recognized.\nStock based compensation expenses increased by $0.2 million due primarily to higher amortization of compensation expense for grants under the 2011 LTIP.\nOther expenses increased by $0.5 million due primarily to one-time advertising and related expenses of $0.7 million associated with the company re-branding to the name SP\u014cK in 2014, partially offset by reductions in various other expenses, net of $0.2 million.\nGeneral and administrative.

Payroll and related expenses decreased by $1.8 million reflecting headcount reductions of 11 FTEs to 132 FTEs at December 31, 2014 from 143 FTEs at December 31, 2013. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with RSUs and common stock awarded to certain eligible employees and amortization of compensation expense for restricted stock awarded to non-executive members of our Board of Directors under the 2012 Equity Incentive Award Plan (\"Equity Plan\"). Stock based compensation expenses increased by $0.5 million due primarily to higher amortization of compensation expense for grants under 2011 LTIP. \n \u2022 Bad debt - The decrease of $0.6 million in bad debt expenses reflects the decrease of our wireless revenue and the improvement in collection efforts associated with our software revenue. \n \u2022 Outside services - Outside service expenses consisted primarily of professional services fees associated with compliance activities for annual reporting, taxes and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\") and the printing and mailing of invoices. The $0.9 million decrease in outside service expenses was primarily due to lower professional services fees for external accounting and tax support services. \n \u2022 Repairs and maintenance - The increase of $0.6 million in repairs and maintenance expenses reflects the increase of our efforts associated with supporting our sales and customer services. \n \u2022 Other - The increase of $1.5 million in other expenses was due primarily to a non-recurring charge of $0.8 million related to future billing credits, higher recruiting and relocation expenses of $0.5 million and various other expenses net of $0.2 million.  Severance and restructuring. Severance and restructuring expenses increased to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.0 million for the same period in 2013 due primarily to higher severance charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 for post-employment benefits resulting from planned staffing reductions. We accrued post-employment benefits if certain specified criteria are met. Post-employment benefits include salary continuation, severance benefits and continuation of health insurance benefits. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our severance and restructuring policies.)\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses were $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $15.2 million for the same period in 2013. The increase was primarily due to $0.9 million in higher depreciation expense for the period for non-paging device assets and $0.8 million in higher amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the change in the useful life of Amcom related intangibles due to our rebranding, net of $0.2 million in other changes. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our depreciation expense policies.)\nInterest expense, net, Other income, net and Income tax expense\nInterest expense, net. Net interest expense increased to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.3 million for the same period in 2013. This increase was primarily due to recognition of remaining deferred financing costs associated with the revolving credit facility, which was terminated on December 15, 2014. (See Note 4).\nOther expense, net. Net other expense increased to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from net other income of $0.1 million for the same period in 2013. The increase in net other expense in 2014 was primarily due to a settlement for the closure of a facility of $0.3 million, an incentive plan buyout of $0.1 million and higher financial services fees of $0.1 million in 2014.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $6.6 million, a decrease of $11.2 million from the prior year's income tax expense of $17.8 million. The decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate was largely due to a reduction of income before tax of $18.0 million and a release of the deferred tax assets (\"DTA\") Valuation Allowance of $5.1 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 24.1%, which was a decrease of 15.2% from the December 31, 2013 effective tax rate of 39.3%.\nThe following is the effective tax rate reconciliation for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third-party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. Cash held in these accounts is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third-party financial institutions. These funds invest in direct obligations of the government of the United States. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nAt any point in time, we have approximately $7.0 to $12.0 million in our operating accounts that are with third-party financial institutions. While we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts.\nWe intend to use our cash on hand to provide working capital, to support operations, and to return value to stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock. We may also consider using cash to invest in our operations or fund acquisitions of assets of other businesses that we believe will provide a measure of growth or revenue stability while supporting our operating structure.\nOverview\nIn the event that net cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand are not sufficient to meet future cash requirements, we may be required to reduce planned capital expenses, reduce or eliminate our cash dividends to stockholders, reduce or eliminate our common stock repurchase program, and/or sell assets or seek additional financing. We can provide no assurance that reductions in planned capital expenses or proceeds from asset sales would be sufficient to cover shortfalls in available cash or that additional financing would be available on acceptable terms. As of December 31, 2015, our available cash on hand was $111.3 million.\nBased on current and anticipated levels of operations, we anticipate net cash provided by operating activities, together with the available cash on hand at December 31, 2015, should be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table sets forth information on our net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods stated:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Between 2015 and 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(5,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,614\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(28,984\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,312\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,833\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities. As discussed above, we are dependent on cash flows from operating activities to meet our cash requirements. Cash from operations varies depending on changes in various working capital items, including deferred revenues, accounts payable, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and various accrued expenses. The following table includes the cash receipt and expenditure components of our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated, and sets forth the change between the stated periods:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change Between 2015 and 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash received from customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid for\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll and related costs\n</td> <td>81,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Site rent costs\n</td> <td>15,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Telecommunications costs\n</td> <td>6,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,339\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest costs\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating costs\n</td> <td>52,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>575\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>156,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to a decrease in cash received from customers of $0.7 million, an an increase in cash paid for operating expenses of $2.8 million. Cash received from customers consisted of revenue and direct taxes billed to customers adjusted for changes in accounts receivable, deferred revenue and tax withholding amounts. The decrease of $0.7 million was due to lower\nrevenue of $10.6 million off-set by higher collection of accounts receivable of $9.2 million and a net increase of $0.7 million in deferred revenue, customer deposits, and other.\nThe increase in cash paid for operating expenses of $2.8 million was as follows:\n \u2022 Cash payments for payroll and related costs increased by $4.4 million primarily due to high headcount and an additional pay period resulting in high payroll and related payments. \n \u2022 Cash payments for site rent costs decreased $0.7 million. This decrease was due primarily to lower site rent costs for leased locations as we rationalized our network and incurred lower payments than in 2014. \n \u2022 Cash payments for telecommunication costs decreased $1.3 million. This decrease was due primarily to the consolidation of our networks and reflects continued office and staffing reductions to support our smaller customer base for wireless revenue. \n \u2022 Cash payments for other operating costs increased $0.6 million. The increase was due primarily to a decrease in accounts payable of $0.7 million off set by a decrease of $0.4 million in inventory purchases to support software sales and a net $0.3 million increase in payments for other expenses. \nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to lower capital expenses for property and equipment of $1.3 million and an increase in the proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the same period in 2014.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the same period in 2014 due to stock repurchases of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, we paid $3.1 million more in cash dividends to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, which includes $0.6 million in dividends paid on the vested RSUs issued under the 2011 LTIP in 2015.\nCash Dividends to Stockholders. For the year ended on December 31, 2015, we paid a total of $13.3 million (or $0.625 per share of common stock) in quarterly cash dividends and special dividend compared to $10.8 million (or $0.50 per share of common stock) in quarterly cash dividends for the same period in 2014.\nFuture Cash Dividends to Stockholders. On February 24, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock, with a record date of March 18, 2016, and a payment date of March 30, 2016. This cash dividend of approximately $2.6 million will be paid from available cash on hand.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program. On July 31, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase our common stock in the open market. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC administers such purchases. We expect to use available cash on hand and net cash provided by operating activities to fund the common stock repurchase program.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased 897,117 shares of our common stock under the repurchase program for $15.0 million. The Company's stock repurchase program has been extended at various dates between 2009 through 2015 by our Board of Directors. The available repurchase authority is $10.0 million as of January 4, 2016 and expires on December 31, 2016. This repurchase authority allows us, at management's discretion, to selectively repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market depending upon market price and other factors. (See Note 5 for further discussion on our common stock repurchase program.)\nBorrowings. On November 8, 2011 we executed the First Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ( Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC ( Wells Fargo\u201d). The Amended Credit Agreement increased the amount of the revolving credit facility to $40.0 million. The maturity date for the revolving credit facility was September 3, 2015. The Amended Credit Agreement also revised the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) definition to eliminate the LIBOR floor and reduced the interest rate margin to 3.25%. Borrowings under this facility were secured by a lien on substantially all of the existing assets, interests in assets and proceeds owned or acquired by us. We were subject to certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement. These financial covenants consisted of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.\nOn December 15, 2014, we terminated the Amended Credit Agreement and underlying revolving credit facility. At the time the revolving credit facility was terminated, we were in compliance with all the required financial covenants and did not incur any early termination penalties. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding debt. (See Note 4 for further discussion on our long-term debt.)\nCommitments and Contingencies\nContractual Obligations. As of December 31, 2015, our contractual payment obligations under our operating leases for office and transmitter locations are indicated in the table below. For purposes of the table below, purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable pricing provisions; and the approximate timing of transactions. These purchase obligations primarily relate to certain telecommunication and information technology expenses. The amounts are based on our contractual commitments; however, it is possible that we may be able to negotiate lower payments if we choose to exit these contracts before their expiration date. Other obligations as indicated below consisted primarily of expected future payments for asset retirements and cumulative dividends primarily under the 2015 LTIP payable to certain eligible employees.\nThe following table provides the Company's significant commitments and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>12,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other obligations\n</td> <td>9,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Commitments and Contingencies. See Note 7 for further discussion on other commitments and contingencies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\nRelated Parties\nSee Note 15 for further discussion on our related party transactions.\nInflation\nInflation has not had a material effect on our operations to date. System equipment and operating costs have not significantly increased in price, and the price of wireless messaging devices has tended to decline in recent years. This reduction in costs has generally been reflected in lower prices charged to subscribers who purchase their wireless messaging devices. Our general operating expenses, such as salaries, site rent for transmitter locations, employee benefits and occupancy costs, are subject to normal inflationary pressures.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preceding discussion and analysis of financial condition and statement of income is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to those related to the impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization and goodwill, accounts receivable allowances, revenue recognition, asset retirement obligations, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or condition.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Goodwill\nWe are required to evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill. Amortizable intangible assets include customer related intangibles, technology based intangibles, contract based intangibles and\nmarketing intangibles that primarily resulted from our previous acquisitions. Such intangibles are being amortized over periods up to ten years. Quarterly, we assess whether circumstances exist which suggest that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When applicable, we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets and certain amortizable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. In assessing the recoverability of these assets, we forecasted estimated enterprise-level cash flows based on operating assumptions such as revenue forecasted by product line. If the forecast of undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying value of the long-lived assets, we would record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value exceeded the fair value of such assets.\nGoodwill resulting from our acquisitions is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or when events or circumstances suggest a potential impairment has occurred. We performed this annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2015. We evaluate goodwill for impairment between annual tests if indicators of impairment exist. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we compare the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the implied fair value is less than the carrying value of the goodwill, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss. For purposes of the goodwill impairment evaluation, the Company as a whole is considered the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated under a market based approach using the fair value of the Company's common stock. A confirmatory discounted cash flow analysis is also used to assess whether impairment exists. This calculation requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nWe did not record any impairment of long-lived assets, definite lived intangible assets or goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nAccounts Receivable Allowances\nOur two most significant allowance accounts are an allowance for doubtful accounts and an allowance for service credits. Provisions for these allowances are recorded on a monthly basis and are included as a component of general and administrative expenses and a reduction of revenue, respectively.\nEstimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on historical collection experience and current and forecasted trends. In determining these percentages, we review historical write-offs, including comparisons of write-offs to provisions for doubtful accounts and as a percentage of revenues. We compare the ratio of the allowance to gross receivables to historical levels, and monitor amounts collected and related statistics. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.6 million,$0.7 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We write off receivables when they are deemed uncollectible. While write-offs of customer accounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that our future write-off experience will be consistent with historical experience, which could result in material differences in the allowance for doubtful accounts and related provisions.\nThe allowance for service credits and maintenance related provisions is based on historical credit percentages, current credit and aging trends, historical actual payment trends and actual credit experience. We analyze our past credit experience over several time frames. Using this analysis along with current operational data including existing experience of credits issued and the time frames in which credits are issued, we establish an appropriate allowance for service credits. The allowance for service credits was $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This allowance reduces accounts receivable for lost and non-returned pagers to the expected realizable amounts and for free wireless services. In addition, this allowance reduces software maintenance revenue. While credits issued have been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that future credit experience will be consistent with historical experience, which could result in material differences in the allowance for service credits and maintenance related provisions.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when four basic criteria have been met:\n\u2022there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;\n\u2022delivery has occurred or services rendered;\n\u2022the fee is fixed or determinable; and\n\u2022collectability is reasonably assured.\nAmounts billed to customers, but not meeting the above revenue recognition criteria are deferred until all four criteria have been met.\nSigned agreements are used as evidence of an arrangement. If a contract signed by the customer does not exist, we use a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. If both a signed contract and a purchase order exist, we consider the signed contract to be the final persuasive evidence of an arrangement. At the time a contract is executed, we evaluate the contract to assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable. If the fee is assessed as not being fixed or determinable, revenue recognition is delayed until this assessment can be made. Additionally, we review customer creditworthiness and our historical ability to collect payments due.\nOur wireless revenue consists primarily of service, rental and maintenance fees charged to customers on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Revenue also includes the sale of messaging devices directly to customers and other companies that resell our services. With respect to revenue recognition for multiple deliverables, we evaluated these revenue arrangements and determined that two separate units of accounting exist, paging service revenue and product sales. We recognize paging service revenue over the period the service is performed; revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment or installation. We have a variety of billing arrangements with our customers resulting in deferred revenue from advance billings and accounts receivables for billing in-arrears arrangements.\nOur software revenue consists primarily of the sale of software (license fees), professional services (primarily installation and training), equipment (to be used in conjunction with the software) and maintenance support (post-contract support). The software is licensed to end users under an industry standard software license agreement. Our software products are considered to be off-the-shelf software\u201d as the software is marketed as a stock item that customers can use without customization.\nSoftware revenue consists of two primary components: (1) operations revenue consisting of software license revenue, professional services revenue and equipment sales, and (2) maintenance revenue.\nWe generally sell software licenses, professional services, equipment and maintenance in multiple-element arrangements. At inception of the arrangement, we allocate the arrangement consideration to the software deliverables (software licenses, professional services and maintenance) as a group and to the non-software deliverables (equipment and maintenance on equipment, when applicable) using the relative selling price method. When performing this allocation, the estimated selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE\u201d), third party evidence of fair value ( TPE\u201d), or if VSOE and TPE are not available, the best estimated selling price ( BESP\u201d) for selling the element on a stand-alone basis. We have determined that TPE is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.\nOur standard post contract support (maintenance) is allocated using VSOE as an input in the relative selling price allocation. For software licenses, professional services, equipment and premium maintenance we have determined that neither VSOE nor TPE is available and as such, we have used BESP as an input in order to allocate our arrangement fees. We determine BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices take into consideration our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.\nIn multiple-element arrangements, the arrangement consideration allocated to our non-software deliverables (equipment) is generally recognized upon shipment or delivery to the customer depending on delivery method of Free on Board (\"FOB\") shipping or FOB destination, respectively.\nFor our software deliverables, which include software licenses, professional services, and post contract support (maintenance), we further allocate arrangement consideration using the residual method. As noted above, we have not established VSOE for our software licenses, professional services and premium maintenance. However, we have established, and continue to maintain, VSOE for our standard post contract support (maintenance). We recognize contract revenue ratably over the longer of the estimated services delivery period or the maintenance term. If delivery of the software and services is completed before the end of the maintenance period, then the remaining deferred revenue associated with these elements is recognized in full at this time. Any unrecognized revenue related to maintenance continues to be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the maintenance period. If the period of delivery to the customer is not known, license and professional services revenue will be recognized when software and professional services are fully delivered to the customer and the maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining contractual term of the agreement. Prior to January 1, 2014, we did not have a method for reasonably estimating the services period and therefore, license and professional services revenue was primarily recognized at the time of full delivery. In 2014, we developed a methodology for reasonably estimating the services period and have been able to recognize license and professional services revenue ratably on most contracts. Generally, the defined services period for most of our projects is shorter than the maintenance term.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize liabilities and corresponding assets for future obligations associated with the retirement of assets. We have paging equipment assets, principally transmitters, which are located on leased locations. The underlying leases generally require the removal of equipment at the end of the lease term; therefore, a future obligation exists.\nAsset retirement costs are reflected in paging equipment assets with depreciation expense recognized over the estimated lives, which range between one and five years. The asset retirement costs were $3.6 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net increase in asset retirement costs in 2015 is related to the revised deconstruction forecast during the period. Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included benefits of $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, related to depreciation of these asset retirement costs.The benefits in depreciation expense for these years are due to net reductions to the asset retirement costs as a result of changes in the timing and costs of the transmitter deconstructions. The asset retirement costs and the corresponding liabilities that have been recorded to date generally relate to either current plans to consolidate networks or to the removal of assets at a future terminal date.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, accrued other liabilities included $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of asset retirement liabilities related to our efforts to reduce the number of transmitters in operation; other long-term liabilities included $7.5 million and $6.8 million, respectively, related primarily to an estimate of the costs of deconstructing assets through the terminal date. The primary variables associated with these estimates are the number of transmitters and related equipment to be removed, the timing of removal, and a fair value estimate of the outside contractor fees to remove each asset. The fair value estimate of contractor fees to remove each asset is assumed to escalate by 4% each year through the terminal date.\nThe cost associated with the estimated removal costs and timing refinements due to ongoing network rationalization activities will accrete to a total liability of $9.3 million. The accretion was recorded on the interest method utilizing the following discount rates for the specified periods:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period\n</td> <td>Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 - January 1 through December 31 - Additions(1)\n</td> <td>11.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 - December 31 - Incremental Estimates(2)\n</td> <td>10.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014 - January 1 through December 31 - Additions(1)\n</td> <td>10.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014 - December 31 - Incremental Estimates(2)\n</td> <td>12.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013 - December 31 Additions(1) and Incremental Estimates\n</td> <td>10.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013 - January 1 through September 30 - Additions(1)\n</td> <td>10.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Transmitters moved to new sites resulting in additional liability. \n (2) Weighted average credit adjusted risk-free rate used to discount downward revision to estimated future cash flows.  The total estimated liability is based on transmitter locations remaining after we have consolidated the number of networks we operate and assume the underlying leases continue to be renewed to that future date. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $0.7 million, $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for accretion expense on the asset retirement obligation liabilities.\nWe believe these estimates are reasonable at the present time, but we can give no assurance that changes in technology, our financial condition, the economy or other factors would not result in higher or lower asset retirement obligations. Any variations from our estimates would generally result in a change in the assets and liabilities in equal amounts, and operating results would differ in the future by any difference in depreciation expense and accretion expense.\nIncome Taxes - Uncertainties and Deferred Income Tax Assets (\"DTAs\")\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of tax-related assets, liabilities and income tax expense. These estimates and assumptions are based on the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d). The ASC includes provisions relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.\nWe file our income tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are required to evaluate the recoverability of our DTAs. The assessment is to determine whether based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than a 50% probability) that all or some portion of the DTAs will be realized in the future.\nThe DTA valuation allowance reflects management's judgment concerning the ultimate recoverability of the DTAs. As of December 31, 2015, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the net DTAs of $84.0 million will be recoverable. Approximately 85.0% of our net DTAs consist of net operating loss carryforwards. For the three years ended December 31, 2014,\nthe Company has utilized approximately $121.7 million of net operating losses which translates into approximately $48.5 million of DTAs and we expect to utilize $26.4 million of NOLs for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe consider both positive and negative evidence when evaluating the recoverability of our DTAs. During the fourth quarter of each year, we prepare a multi-year forecast of taxable income for our operations. In preparing our analysis of the recoverability of our DTAs, we consider the following possible sources of taxable income:\n1. Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.\nWe consider 100% of our existing taxable temporary differences when estimating the amount of recoverable DTAs. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $5.5 million of taxable temporary differences which we believe will be recoverable over the next 20 year carryforward period. Most of these differences relate to software intangible assets that have a 15 year recovery period.\n2. Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nAs described above, we use a multi-year forecast of taxable income for the Company. DTAs are realizable if future deductible amounts would reduce taxes that would be paid on future taxable income excluding the reversal of existing temporary differences.\n3. Taxable income in carryback years to the extent permitted by tax law.\nWe have exhausted our carryback potential and now only have carryforwards available.\n4. Tax planning strategies.\nSince 2012, we elected to capitalize and amortize over 10 years, software research and development costs. In the near term, this has the effect of increasing taxable income and the amount of net operating losses utilized.\nThe balance of the DTA valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $45.8 million and $114.2 million, respectively. The estimated recoverable DTAs at December 31, 2015 totaled $84.0 million and at December 31, 2014 was $24.1 million. These estimated recoverable amounts represent approximately 64.7% and 17.5%, respectively, of the total DTAs before the valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRecent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Since the ASU was issued, the FASB has issued several changes, most notably in July 2015, which delayed the effective date. Our effective date is January 1, 2018 and while early adoption to the original effective date of January 1, 2017 is permitted, we have elected not to early adopt.\nASU No. 2014-09 creates a five-step model that requires companies to exercise judgment when considering all relevant facts and circumstances in the determination of when and how revenue is recognized. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We have not selected a transition method. We continue to evaluate the potential impact from this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which was issued as part of the FASB's simplification initiative, which has an objective of identifying areas of GAAP that can be simplified for the purpose of reducing an entity's costs while continuing to provide useful information to financial statement users. ASU 2015-17 allows entities to classify deferred tax assets or liabilities as non-current rather than splitting the balance between a current and non-current balance. Entities may apply this new guidance prospectively or retrospectively when adopting this standard.\nThe effective date is January 1, 2017, however, early adoption of the standard is effective immediately. We have decided to early adopt this guidance and have classified our DTA as non-current at December, 31, 2015. Early adoption did not have a material impact on our overall financial statements and does not alter our overall financial results. We applied the guidance retrospectively for the purposes of providing comparable financial statement results. Retrospective application of this standard resulted in a\nreclassification of the current DTAs of $2.2 million, net of the valuation allowance to a non-current asset in our balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 2014. Retrospective application had no other financial statement impact.\nThe FASB is expected to issue an ASU on the accounting for leases in the first quarter of 2016. The new standard is expected to establish a right of use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either financing or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.\nThe new ASU is expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is expected to be required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. While we are still evaluating the impact of the potential new standard on our consolidated financial statements, we expect that upon adoption we will recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities and that the amounts could be material.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use a non-GAAP financial measure as a key element in determining performance for purposes of incentive compensation under our annual Short-Term Incentive Plan (\"STIP\"). That non-GAAP financial measure is operating cash flow ( OCF\u201d), defined as EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment (EBITDA is defined as operating income plus depreciation, amortization, accretion and impairment, each determined in accordance with GAAP). Purchases of property and equipment are also determined in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of STIP performance, OCF was as follows for the periods stated:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Depreciation, amortization, accretion and impairment\n</td> <td>13,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA (as defined by the Company)\n</td> <td>39,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(6,374\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,679\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,408\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OCF (as defined by the Company)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND STATEMENT OF\nINCOME\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the discussion under Application of Critical Accounting Policies\u201d (also under Item 7), which describes key estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements; Item 1. Business,\u201d which describes our operations; and Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d which describes key risks associated with our operations and markets in which we operate. A reference to a Note\u201d in this section refers to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOverview\nWe offer our communication services and products in the United States and abroad primarily to three major market segments: healthcare, government and large enterprise, but with a greater emphasis on the healthcare market segment. For wireless revenue, the government business has been trending downward over the last several years as state and local governments have been struggling with budget constraints. Large enterprise customers have been trending away from paging to cellular/smart phones for a number of years and we expect that trend to continue in the future. At the same time, our wireless services tend to be a reliable and low cost communication alternative when budgets are constrained and therefore paging services can be positioned well against other communication tools. Our software services leverage these trends with more advanced critical messaging offerings such as our Sp\u014dk Mobile offering for smart phones, which enables caregivers and physicians to communicate more effectively. The trend toward more advanced/smart communications devices has been ongoing in large enterprise and is emerging in the healthcare and government sectors.\nThe following tables present wireless and software revenue by key market segments for the periods stated and illustrate the relative significance of these market segments to our operations.\n\n(1) Other includes hospitality, resort and billable travel revenue. \n(1) Other includes hospitality, resort and billable travel revenue.\nWe generate revenue by providing wireless messaging services, as well as developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services. Our most significant expenses are related to employee compensation, cost of sales, site rents, telecommunications and transactional taxes.\nWireless Revenue\nWe provide one-way and advanced two-way wireless messaging services including information services throughout the United States. We provide wireless messaging services to subscribers for a periodic fee. In addition, subscribers either lease a messaging device from us for an additional fixed monthly fee or they own a device, having purchased it either from us or from another vendor (\"direct\"). We also sell devices to resellers who lease or resell devices to their subscribers and then sell messaging services utilizing our networks (\"indirect\"). We also offer ancillary services, such as voice mail and equipment loss and/or maintenance protection to both one-way and two-way messaging subscribers. We market and distribute these wireless messaging and information services through a direct sales force and a small indirect sales channel. (See Item 1. Business\u201d for more details.)\nWireless revenue consists of two primary components: paging revenue and product and other revenue. The breakout of\nwireless revenue by component was as follows for the periods stated:\n\nThe following table summarizes the breakdown of our direct and indirect units in service (that underlies our paging revenue)at specified dates:\n\nAs noted above in Overview,\u201d our key market segments are healthcare, government and large enterprise, but with a greater emphasis on the healthcare market segment. The following table indicates the percentage of our units in service by key market segments for the periods stated and illustrates the relative significance of these market segments to our business.\n\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from fixed monthly or other periodic fees, charged to subscribers for wireless messaging services. Such fees are not generally dependent on usage. As long as a subscriber maintains service, operating results benefit from recurring payment of these fees.\nWireless revenue is generally based upon the number of units in service and the monthly charge per unit. The number of units in service changes based on subscribers added, referred to as gross placements, less subscriber cancellations, or disconnects. The net of gross placements and disconnects is commonly referred to as net gains or losses of units in service or net disconnect rate. The absolute number of gross placements as well as the number of gross placements relative to average units in service in a period, referred to as the gross placement rate, is monitored on a monthly basis. Disconnects are also monitored on a monthly basis. The ratio of units disconnected in a period to average units in service for the same period, called the disconnect rate, is an indicator of our success at retaining subscribers, which is important in order to maintain recurring revenue and to control operating expenses.\nThe following table sets forth our gross placements and disconnects for the periods stated:\n\nThe following table sets forth information on our direct units in service by account size for the periods stated:\n\nThe following table sets forth information on the direct net disconnect rate by account size for our direct customers for the periods stated:\n\nThe other factor that contributes to revenue, in addition to the number of units in service, is the monthly charge per unit. As previously discussed, the monthly charge per unit is dependent on the subscriber's service, extent of geographic coverage, whether the subscriber leases or owns the messaging device, and the number of units the customer has in the account. The ratio of revenue for a period to the average units in service, for the same period, commonly referred to as average revenue per unit (\"ARPU\"), is a key revenue measurement as it indicates whether charges for similar services and distribution channels are increasing or decreasing. ARPU by distribution channel and messaging service are monitored regularly.\nThe following table sets forth ARPU by distribution channel for the periods stated:\n\nWhile ARPU for similar services and distribution channels is indicative of changes in monthly charges and the revenue rate applicable to new subscribers, this measurement on a consolidated basis is affected by several factors, including the mix of units in service and the pricing of the various components of our services. We expect future sequential annual revenues to decline in line with recent trends. The change in ARPU in the direct distribution channel is the most significant indicator of rate-related changes in our revenue. The decrease in consolidated ARPU during the years 2013 through 2015 was due to the change in composition of our customer base as the percentage of units in service attributable to larger customers continues to increase. These larger customers benefit from lower pricing associated with their larger number of units-in-service. We believe that without further price adjustments, ARPU would trend lower for both the direct and indirect distribution channels in 2016. Price increases could mitigate, but not completely offset, the expected declines in both ARPU and revenue.\nThe following table sets forth information on direct ARPU by account size for the periods stated:\n\nSoftware Revenue\nWe enter into agreements whereby our customers purchase products and services including software, professional services (primarily installation and training), equipment (to be used in conjunction with the software), and maintenance support (post-contract support). The software is licensed to end-users under an industry standard software license agreement.\nSoftware revenue consists of two primary components: operations revenue and maintenance revenue.\nOperations revenue consists of subscription services revenue, software license revenue, professional services revenue, and equipment sales. Maintenance revenue is for ongoing support of a software application or equipment (typically for one year). We recognize equipment revenue when it is shipped or delivered to the customer depending on delivery method of Free on Board (\"FOB\") shipping or FOB destination, respectively. As of January 1, 2014, license, professional services and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the longer of the period of professional services delivery to the customer or the contractual term of the maintenance agreement. If the period of delivery to the customer is not known, license and professional services revenue will be recognized when software and professional services are fully delivered to the customer and maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining contractual term of the maintenance agreement. Prior to January 1, 2014, license and professional services revenue was recognized when the services were fully delivered to the customer and maintenance revenue was recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement. After the initial maintenance term, customers typically renew their maintenance support. The maintenance renewal rates for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 99.7%, 99.5% and 99.1%, respectively.\nThe breakout of revenue by component was as follows for the periods stated:\n\nOn a regular basis, we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers to provide software licenses, professional services, and equipment. In addition, we enter into contractual arrangements for maintenance with our customers on new solutions or renewals on existing solutions. These contractual arrangements are reported as bookings and represent future revenue. Bookings decreased by 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease primarily reflects slower growth than planned in our international sales. We currently plan to continue expansion in the European, Middle Eastern, Australian and Asia Pacific markets in 2016.\nThe following table summarizes total bookings for the periods stated:\n\nOperations and new maintenance orders in 2014 reflect $6.7 million of one-time bookings related to a U.S. government entity. We reported a software backlog of $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which represented all purchase orders received from customers not yet recognized as revenue.\n\n (1) Other reflects cancellations and adjustments to backlog. Backlog is reviewed periodically during the year. Adjustments to backlog reflect customer cancellations, changes in customer requirements and Company cancellations due to credit or other payment issues.  The breakout of backlog by source was as follows at each quarter end in 2015:\n\nOperations - Consolidated\nOur operating expenses are presented in functional categories. Certain of our functional categories are especially important to overall expense control and management. These operating expenses are categorized as follows:\n \u2022 Cost of revenue. These are expenses primarily for hardware, third-party software, outside service expenses and payroll and related expenses for our professional services, logistics, customer support and maintenance staff. \n \u2022 Service, rental and maintenance. These are expenses associated with the operation of our paging networks and development of our software. Expenses consist largely of site rent expenses for transmitter locations, telecommunication expenses to deliver messages over our paging networks, and payroll and related expenses for our engineering, pager repair functions and development and maintenance of our software products. \n \u2022 Selling and marketing. These are expenses associated with our direct sales force and indirect sales channel and marketing expenses in support of those sales groups. This classification consists primarily of payroll and related expenses and commission expenses. \n \u2022 General and administrative. These are expenses associated with information technology and administrative functions. This classification consists primarily of payroll and related expenses, outside service expenses, taxes, licenses and permit expenses, and facility rent expenses.  We review the percentages of these operating expenses to revenue on a regular basis. Even though the operating expenses are classified as described above, expense control and management are also performed by expense category. Approximately 75% of the operating expenses referred to above were incurred in payroll and related expenses, cost of sales, site and facility rent expenses and telecommunication expenses for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Payroll and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included an expense of $0.3 million due to a change in the service period under the 2015 LTIP associated with the departure of a former executive.\nOur largest expense, payroll and related expenses, includes wages, commissions, incentives, employee benefits and related\ntaxes. On a monthly basis, we review the number of employees in major functional categories and the design and physical locations of functional groups to continuously improve efficiency, to simplify organizational structures, and to minimize the number of physical locations for the Company. We have 600 full-time equivalent employees ( FTEs\u201d) at December 31, 2015, an increase of 2.2% from 587 FTEs at December 31, 2014. The increase in the number of FTEs reflects the additional headcount associated with our software revenues.\nCost of sales includes distribution costs for equipment and products sold and/or licensed, operating costs related to product implementation, training, and product support services, and costs associated with the delivery of third party implementation services and third party license, and/or maintenance support.\nSite rent expenses for transmitter locations are largely dependent on our paging networks. We operate local, regional, and nationwide one-way and two-way paging networks. These networks each require locations on which to place transmitters, receivers, and antennae. Site rent expenses for transmitter locations are highly dependent on the number of transmitters, which in turn is dependent on the number of networks. In addition, these expenses generally do not vary directly with the number of subscribers or units in service, which is detrimental to our operating margins as revenue declines. In order to reduce these expenses, we have an active program to consolidate the number of paging networks, and thus transmitter locations, which we refer to as network rationalization. We have reduced the number of active transmitters by 2.2% to 4,243 active transmitters at December 31, 2015 from 4,339 active transmitters at December 31, 2014.\nTelecommunication expenses are incurred to interconnect our paging networks and to provide telephone numbers for customer use, points of contact for customer service, and connectivity among our offices. These expenses are dependent on the number of units in service, the number of customers we support and the number of office and network locations that we maintain. However, the number or duration of telephone calls to call centers may vary from period to period based on factors other than the number of units in service or customers, which could cause telecommunication expenses to vary.\nDue to the integration of the management structure and consolidation of our organization effective January 1, 2014, certain prior years' interim revenue and operating expenses were reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. In 2014, we reported wireless and software revenue, and had reclassified the revenue previously reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2013 (the \"2013 Form 10-K\") to conform with the current year's presentation. In 2013, wireless revenue of $149.45 million was reported as $143.63 million in service, rental and maintenance, net of service credits, and $5.82 million in software revenue and other, net. Also in 2013, software revenue of $60.30 million was reported in software revenue and other, net. We reclassified payroll and related expenses among functional departments and eliminated general and administrative overhead expenses previously allocated to cost of revenue, service, rental and maintenance and selling and marketing. The reclassifications resulted in the following increases and (decreases) to the 2013 Form 10-K reported operating expenses: Cost of revenue of $5.79 million; service, rental and maintenance of ($3.17) million; selling and marketing of $0.53 million; and general and administrative of ($3.15) million. The changes had no impact to previously reported total operating expenses and operating income.\nStatements of Income\nComparison of the Statements of Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\n\nRevenue - Wireless\nOur wireless revenue was $119.0 million and $132.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in wireless revenue of $13.4 million or 10.1% reflects the decrease in demand for our wireless services. Wireless revenue includes paging revenue, product revenue and other revenue. Paging revenue consists primarily of recurring fees associated with the provision of messaging services and rental of leased units and is net of a provision for service credits. Product and other revenue reflects system sales, the sale of devices and charges for leased devices that are not returned and are net of anticipated credits. The table below details total wireless revenue for the periods stated:\n\nThe table below sets forth units in service and paging revenue, the changes in each between 2015 and 2014 and the changes in revenue associated with differences in ARPU and the number of units in service:\n\n (1) Amounts shown exclude non-paging revenue. \nAs previously discussed, demand for messaging services has declined over the past several years and we anticipate that it will continue to decline for the foreseeable future, which would result in reductions in wireless revenue due to the lower number of subscribers and related units in service. In addition, ARPU continues to decline as more customers move to fixed rate plans and new subscribers receive lower monthly rates.\nRevenue - Software\nOur software revenue was $70.6 million and $67.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which consisted of operations revenue (from licenses, subscriptions, professional services and equipment sales) and maintenance revenue. The table below details total revenue for software operations for the periods stated:\n\nThe increase in total software revenue primarily reflects an increase in the maintenance revenue for the period ending December 31, 2015 as compared to the period ending December 31, 2014. The decrease in operations revenue of 2.4% primarily reflects lower sales of software to new customers, which was reflected in the decrease of 13.1% in license revenue. The Company has addressed this decrease in software operations revenue by reorganizing its salesforce and territories and replacing lower performing sales employees with new staff. The Company is unable to predict the timing and impact of these changes on its software operations and bookings in 2016.\nThe increase in maintenance revenue reflects our continuing success in renewals of our maintenance support for existing software solutions, the impact of price increases at renewal and in maintenance support for sales of new solutions. The maintenance renewal rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 99.7% and 99.5%, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue consisted primarily of the following items:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $1.3 million or 4.0% from the same period in 2014 due to the following variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - The increase of $1.4 million in payroll and related expenses was due primarily to the additional twelve FTEs in the professional services and maintenance support teams, which supported the increase in service and maintenance revenue. \n \u2022 Cost of sales - The increase of $0.4 million in cost of sales was primarily due to charges related to missing or obsolete inventory in the second quarter of 2015, which was partially off-set by lower third-party professional services related to the implementation of software sales orders. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) granted to certain eligible employees. Stock based compensation expenses decreased by $0.2 million due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for awards under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\"). (See Note 5).  Service, rental and maintenance. Service, rental and maintenance expenses consisted primarily of the following items:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, service, rental and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $1.1 million or 2.4% from the same period in 2014 due to the following variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred largely for field technicians, their managers, and in-house repair personnel and product development, product strategy and quality assurance personnel. The increase in payroll and related expenses of $1.0 million was due to six net additional FTEs in product development as compared to the comparable period. \n \u2022 Site rent - The decrease of $0.8 million in site rent expenses was primarily due to the rationalization of our networks, which has decreased the number of transmitters required to provide service to our customers. The reduction in transmitters has, in turn, reduced the number of lease locations. The number of active transmitters declined 2.2% from 2014 to 2015. \n \u2022 Telecommunications - The decrease of $1.5 million in telecommunication expenses was due to the consolidation of our networks. We believe continued reductions in these expenses will occur as our networks continue to be consolidated as anticipated, throughout 2016, and as we reduce our telephone circuit inventory. \n \u2022 Other - The increase of $0.3 million in other expenses was due primarily to higher outside services expense associated with third party product development support.  Selling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consisted of the following items:\n\nAs indicated in the table above, selling and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $2.6 million, or 8.6%, from the same period in 2014. Selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of payroll and related expenses, which decreased $1.0 million due to lower average payroll and related expenses for sales staff selling software solutions.\nThe sales and marketing staff are involved in selling our communication solutions domestically and internationally. These\nexpenses support our efforts to maintain gross placements of units in service, which mitigated the impact of disconnects on our wireless revenue base, and to identify business opportunities for additional or future software sales. We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our products and vertical sales efforts by strengthening our brand, generating sales leads\nand facilitating the sales process. These marketing functions are accomplished through targeted email campaigns, webinars, regional and national user conferences, monthly newsletters and participation at industry trade shows.\nCommission expenses decreased by $1.2 million due primarily to the impact of a change in the commission plan incentives, which lowered the commission paid on the sale of certain products and a decrease in software operations revenue in 2015. Commission expense is recognized when the underlying revenue from the sales order is recognized.\nAs noted above, the Company has addressed the lower software operations revenue with a reorganization of its salesforce and territories along with the replacement of lower performing sales employees with new staff. The Company has also adjusted its commission plans to focus staff on selling software to new customers to increase software license revenue. The Company is unable to predict the timing and impact of these changes on its software operations bookings and revenue in 2016.\nStock based compensation expenses decreased by $0.4 million due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for grants under the 2015 LTIP. (See Note 5)\nOther expenses remained consistent for the year ending December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year. Other expenses include outside services and other advertising expenses.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consisted of the following items:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $3.7 million, or 8.1%, from the same period in 2014 due to the following variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred for employees in information technology, administrative operations, finance, human resources and executive management. Payroll and related expenses decreased by $0.4 million reflecting headcount reductions of eleven FTEs to 121 FTEs at December 31, 2015 from 132 FTEs at December 31, 2014 partially off-set by higher average salaries. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with RSUs, common stock awarded to certain eligible employees and amortization of compensation expense for restricted stock awarded to non-executive members of our Board of Directors under the 2012 Equity Incentive Award Plan (\"Equity Plan\"). Stock based compensation expenses decreased by $1.3 million due primarily to lower amortization of compensation expense for grants under the 2015 LTIP. (See Note 5) \n \u2022 Bad debt - Bad debt expense remained consistent for the year ended December 31, 2015 as we were able to maintain our collection efforts associated with our software revenue. \n \u2022 Outside services - Outside service expenses consisted primarily of professional services fees associated with compliance reporting, taxes and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\") and the printing and mailing of invoices. The $0.2 million increase in outside service expenses was primarily due to higher professional services fees for external accounting and tax support services. \n \u2022 Repairs and maintenance - The decrease of $0.3 million in repairs and maintenance expenses reflects a lower need for third party support by our sales and customer services teams. \n \u2022 Other - The decrease of $1.4 million in other expenses was due primarily to a non-recurring charge of $0.8 million related to future billing credits, and higher relocation expenses and refunds of $0.5 million and net other changes of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which were not incurred during the current year.  Severance and restructuring. Severance and restructuring expenses increased to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2014. Approximately $1.8 million was due to charges related to the departure of two executives during the year ended December 31, 2015. Charges recorded for other planned staffing reductions remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. We accrued post-employment benefits if certain specified criteria are met. Post-employment benefits include salary continuation, severance benefits and continuation of health insurance benefits. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our severance and restructuring policies.)\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses were $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $16.7 million for the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to $1.6 million in lower depreciation expense for the period for non-paging device assets and $1.0 million in lower amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the change in the useful life of Amcom related intangibles due to our rebranding in 2014, net of $0.1 million in other changes. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our depreciation expense policies.)\nInterest expense, net, Other income, net and Income tax expense\nInterest expense, net. There was no interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, which represents a decrease of $0.5 million for the same period in 2014. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to recognition of the remaining deferred financing costs associated with the revolving credit facility, which was terminated on December 15, 2014. (See Note 4).\nOther income, net. Net other income was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net other expense of $0.4 million for the same period in 2014. The other income, net consisted primarily of income related to the sale of two land parcels of $0.8 million and $0.3 million related to dividend income.\nIncome tax expense (benefit). The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $57.9 million as compared to a net income tax expense of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The income tax benefit in 2015 was the result of a $68.4 million reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the period (See Note 6 for further discussion on our income taxes). The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was (220.3%), which was a decrease of 244.4% from the December 31, 2014 effective tax rate of 24.1%.\nThe following is the effective tax rate reconciliation for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (See Note 6 for further discussion on our income taxes.)\n\nThe pro-forma effective tax rate excludes the effects of the change in the valuation allowance and the change in the deferred income tax rate.\n\nThe decrease in the pro-forma effective tax rate is due primarily to shifts in the allocation of income to lower rate tax jurisdictions within the United States.\nStatements of Income\nComparison of the Statements of Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\n\nRevenue - Wireless\nOur wireless revenue was $132.4 million and $149.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in wireless revenue reflected the decrease in demand for our wireless services. Wireless revenue includes paging revenue, product revenue and other revenue. Paging revenue consists primarily of recurring fees associated with the provision of messaging services and rental of leased units and is net of a provision for service credits. Product and other revenue reflects system sales, the sale of devices and charges for leased devices that are not returned and are net of anticipated credits. The table below details total wireless revenue for the periods stated:\n\nThe table below sets forth units in service and service revenue, the changes in each between 2014 and 2013 and the changes in revenue associated with differences in ARPU and the number of units in service.\n\n (1) Amounts shown exclude non-paging and product and related sales. \nAs previously discussed, demand for messaging services has declined over the past several years and we anticipate that it will continue to decline for the foreseeable future, which would result in reductions in wireless revenue due to the lower number of subscribers and related units in service. In addition, ARPU continues to decline as more customers move to fixed rate plans and new subscribers receive lower monthly rates. Price increases could mitigate, but not completely offset, the declines in ARPU and revenue.\nRevenue - Software\nOur software revenue was $67.9 million and $60.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which consisted of operations revenue (from licenses, subscriptions, professional services and equipment sales) and maintenance revenue. The table below details total software revenue for the periods stated:\n\nThe increase in operations revenue primarily reflects an increase in the average revenue per project compared to the same\nperiod in 2013 reflecting increased professional services for implementations. The increase in maintenance revenue reflects our continuing success in renewals of our maintenance support for existing software solutions, and the impact of price increases at renewal and in maintenance support for sales of new solutions. The maintenance renewal rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 99.5% and 99.1%, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue consisted primarily of the following items:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $4.6 million or 16.6% from the same period in 2013 due to the following variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - The increase of $0.9 million in payroll and related expenses was due primarily to higher average payroll and related expenses for professional services and maintenance support personnel. \n \u2022 Cost of sales - The increase of $3.7 million in cost of sales was primarily due to higher third-party professional services expenses and third-party software and equipment costs associated with the increase in implementation of software sales orders. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) or common stock granted to certain eligible employees. Stock based compensation expenses increased by $0.1 million due primarily to higher amortization of compensation expense for awards under the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\"). (See Note 5). \nService, rental and maintenance. Service, rental and maintenance expenses consisted primarily of the following items:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, service, rental and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $2.0 million or 4.2% from the same period in 2013 due to the following variances:\n \u2022 Site rent - The decrease of $0.8 million in site rent expenses was primarily due to the rationalization of our networks, which has decreased the number of transmitters required to provide service to our customers. The reduction in transmitters has, in turn, reduced the number of lease locations. The number of active transmitters declined 4.4% from 2013 to 2014. \n \u2022 Telecommunications - The decrease of $0.9 million in telecommunication expenses was due to the consolidation of our networks. We believe continued reductions in these expenses will occur as our networks continue to be consolidated as anticipated, throughout 2015, and as we reduce our telephone circuit inventory. \n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred largely for field technicians, their managers, and in-house repair personnel and product development, product strategy and quality assurance personnel. The decrease in payroll and related expenses of $0.5 million was due to a reduction of 7 FTEs as compared to the comparable period. \n \u2022 Other - The increase of $0.4 million in other expenses was due primarily to higher outside services expense associated with temporary help.  Selling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses consisted of the following items:\n\nAs indicated in the table above, selling and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $3.4 million, or 12.8%, from the same period in 2013. Selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of payroll and related expenses, which increased $0.6 million due to higher average payroll and related expenses for sales staff selling software solutions.\nThe sales and marketing staff are involved in selling our communication solutions domestically and internationally. These\nexpenses support our efforts to maintain gross placements of units in service, which mitigated the impact of disconnects on our wireless revenue base, and to identify business opportunities for additional or future software sales. We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our products and vertical sales efforts by strengthening our brand, generating sales leads and facilitating the sales process. These marketing functions are accomplished through targeted email campaigns, webinars, regional and national user conferences, monthly newsletters and participation at industry trade shows.\nCommission expenses increased by $2.1 million due primarily to an increase in software sales and the impact of commission plan incentives for increased sales. Commission expense is recognized as the revenue from the underlying sales order is recognized.\nStock based compensation expenses increased by $0.2 million due primarily to higher amortization of compensation expense for grants under the 2011 LTIP.\nOther expenses increased by $0.5 million due primarily to one-time advertising and related expenses of $0.7 million associated with the company re-branding to the name SP\u014cK in 2014, partially offset by reductions in various other expenses, net of $0.2 million.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consisted of the following items:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $0.2 million, or 0.5%, from the same period in 2013 due to the following variances:\n \u2022 Payroll and related - Payroll and related expenses were incurred for employees in information technology, administrative operations, finance, human resources and executive management. Payroll and related expenses decreased by $1.8 million reflecting headcount reductions of 11 FTEs to 132 FTEs at December 31, 2014 from 143 FTEs at December 31, 2013. \n \u2022 Stock based compensation - Stock based compensation expenses consisted primarily of amortization of compensation expense associated with RSUs and common stock awarded to certain eligible employees and amortization of compensation expense for restricted stock awarded to non-executive members of our Board of Directors under the 2012 Equity Incentive Award Plan (\"Equity Plan\"). Stock based compensation expenses increased by $0.5 million due primarily to higher amortization of compensation expense for grants under 2011 LTIP. \n \u2022 Bad debt - The decrease of $0.6 million in bad debt expenses reflects the decrease of our wireless revenue and the improvement in collection efforts associated with our software revenue. \n \u2022 Outside services - Outside service expenses consisted primarily of professional services fees associated with compliance activities for annual reporting, taxes and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\") and the printing and mailing of invoices. The $0.9 million decrease in outside service expenses was primarily due to lower professional services fees for external accounting and tax support services. \n \u2022 Repairs and maintenance - The increase of $0.6 million in repairs and maintenance expenses reflects the increase of our efforts associated with supporting our sales and customer services. \n \u2022 Other - The increase of $1.5 million in other expenses was due primarily to a non-recurring charge of $0.8 million related to future billing credits, higher recruiting and relocation expenses of $0.5 million and various other expenses net of $0.2 million.  Severance and restructuring. Severance and restructuring expenses increased to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.0 million for the same period in 2013 due primarily to higher severance charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 for post-employment benefits resulting from planned staffing reductions. We accrued post-employment benefits if certain specified criteria are met. Post-employment benefits include salary continuation, severance benefits and continuation of health insurance benefits. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our severance and restructuring policies.)\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses were $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $15.2 million for the same period in 2013. The increase was primarily due to $0.9 million in higher depreciation expense for the period for non-paging device assets and $0.8 million in higher amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the change in the useful life of Amcom related intangibles due to our rebranding, net of $0.2 million in other changes. (See Note 1 for further discussion on our depreciation expense policies.)\nInterest expense, net, Other income, net and Income tax expense\nInterest expense, net. Net interest expense increased to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.3 million for the same period in 2013. This increase was primarily due to recognition of remaining deferred financing costs associated with the revolving credit facility, which was terminated on December 15, 2014. (See Note 4).\nOther expense, net. Net other expense increased to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from net other income of $0.1 million for the same period in 2013. The increase in net other expense in 2014 was primarily due to a settlement for the closure of a facility of $0.3 million, an incentive plan buyout of $0.1 million and higher financial services fees of $0.1 million in 2014.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $6.6 million, a decrease of $11.2 million from the prior year's income tax expense of $17.8 million. The decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate was largely due to a reduction of income before tax of $18.0 million and a release of the deferred tax assets (\"DTA\") Valuation Allowance of $5.1 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 24.1%, which was a decrease of 15.2% from the December 31, 2013 effective tax rate of 39.3%.\nThe following is the effective tax rate reconciliation for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. (See Note 6 for further discussion on our income taxes.)\n\nThe pro-forma effective tax rate excludes the effects of the change in the valuation allowance and the change in the deferred income tax rate. The increase from 2013 primarily reflects changes in the state and local income tax rates applicable to our operations.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $111.3 million. The available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third-party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. Cash held in these accounts is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third-party financial institutions. These funds invest in direct obligations of the government of the United States. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nAt any point in time, we have approximately $7.0 to $12.0 million in our operating accounts that are with third-party financial institutions. While we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts.\nWe intend to use our cash on hand to provide working capital, to support operations, and to return value to stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock. We may also consider using cash to invest in our operations or fund acquisitions of assets of other businesses that we believe will provide a measure of growth or revenue stability while supporting our operating structure.\nOverview\nIn the event that net cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand are not sufficient to meet future cash requirements, we may be required to reduce planned capital expenses, reduce or eliminate our cash dividends to stockholders, reduce or eliminate our common stock repurchase program, and/or sell assets or seek additional financing. We can provide no assurance that reductions in planned capital expenses or proceeds from asset sales would be sufficient to cover shortfalls in available cash or that additional financing would be available on acceptable terms. As of December 31, 2015, our available cash on hand was $111.3 million.\nBased on current and anticipated levels of operations, we anticipate net cash provided by operating activities, together with the available cash on hand at December 31, 2015, should be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table sets forth information on our net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods stated:\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities. As discussed above, we are dependent on cash flows from operating activities to meet our cash requirements. Cash from operations varies depending on changes in various working capital items, including deferred revenues, accounts payable, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and various accrued expenses. The following table includes the cash receipt and expenditure components of our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated, and sets forth the change between the stated periods:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to a decrease in cash received from customers of $0.7 million, an an increase in cash paid for operating expenses of $2.8 million. Cash received from customers consisted of revenue and direct taxes billed to customers adjusted for changes in accounts receivable, deferred revenue and tax withholding amounts. The decrease of $0.7 million was due to lower\nrevenue of $10.6 million off-set by higher collection of accounts receivable of $9.2 million and a net increase of $0.7 million in deferred revenue, customer deposits, and other.\nThe increase in cash paid for operating expenses of $2.8 million was as follows:\n \u2022 Cash payments for payroll and related costs increased by $4.4 million primarily due to high headcount and an additional pay period resulting in high payroll and related payments. \n \u2022 Cash payments for site rent costs decreased $0.7 million. This decrease was due primarily to lower site rent costs for leased locations as we rationalized our network and incurred lower payments than in 2014. \n \u2022 Cash payments for telecommunication costs decreased $1.3 million. This decrease was due primarily to the consolidation of our networks and reflects continued office and staffing reductions to support our smaller customer base for wireless revenue. \n \u2022 Cash payments for other operating costs increased $0.6 million. The increase was due primarily to a decrease in accounts payable of $0.7 million off set by a decrease of $0.4 million in inventory purchases to support software sales and a net $0.3 million increase in payments for other expenses. \nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to lower capital expenses for property and equipment of $1.3 million and an increase in the proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the same period in 2014.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the same period in 2014 due to stock repurchases of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, we paid $3.1 million more in cash dividends to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, which includes $0.6 million in dividends paid on the vested RSUs issued under the 2011 LTIP in 2015.\nCash Dividends to Stockholders. For the year ended on December 31, 2015, we paid a total of $13.3 million (or $0.625 per share of common stock) in quarterly cash dividends and special dividend compared to $10.8 million (or $0.50 per share of common stock) in quarterly cash dividends for the same period in 2014.\nFuture Cash Dividends to Stockholders. On February 24, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock, with a record date of March 18, 2016, and a payment date of March 30, 2016. This cash dividend of approximately $2.6 million will be paid from available cash on hand.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program. On July 31, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase our common stock in the open market. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC administers such purchases. We expect to use available cash on hand and net cash provided by operating activities to fund the common stock repurchase program.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased 897,117 shares of our common stock under the repurchase program for $15.0 million. The Company's stock repurchase program has been extended at various dates between 2009 through 2015 by our Board of Directors. The available repurchase authority is $10.0 million as of January 4, 2016 and expires on December 31, 2016. This repurchase authority allows us, at management's discretion, to selectively repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market depending upon market price and other factors. (See Note 5 for further discussion on our common stock repurchase program.)\nBorrowings. On November 8, 2011 we executed the First Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ( Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC ( Wells Fargo\u201d). The Amended Credit Agreement increased the amount of the revolving credit facility to $40.0 million. The maturity date for the revolving credit facility was September 3, 2015. The Amended Credit Agreement also revised the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) definition to eliminate the LIBOR floor and reduced the interest rate margin to 3.25%. Borrowings under this facility were secured by a lien on substantially all of the existing assets, interests in assets and proceeds owned or acquired by us. We were subject to certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement. These financial covenants consisted of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.\nOn December 15, 2014, we terminated the Amended Credit Agreement and underlying revolving credit facility. At the time the revolving credit facility was terminated, we were in compliance with all the required financial covenants and did not incur any early termination penalties. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding debt. (See Note 4 for further discussion on our long-term debt.)\nCommitments and Contingencies\nContractual Obligations. As of December 31, 2015, our contractual payment obligations under our operating leases for office and transmitter locations are indicated in the table below. For purposes of the table below, purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable pricing provisions; and the approximate timing of transactions. These purchase obligations primarily relate to certain telecommunication and information technology expenses. The amounts are based on our contractual commitments; however, it is possible that we may be able to negotiate lower payments if we choose to exit these contracts before their expiration date. Other obligations as indicated below consisted primarily of expected future payments for asset retirements and cumulative dividends primarily under the 2015 LTIP payable to certain eligible employees.\nThe following table provides the Company's significant commitments and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\n\nOther Commitments and Contingencies. See Note 7 for further discussion on other commitments and contingencies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\nRelated Parties\nSee Note 15 for further discussion on our related party transactions.\nInflation\nInflation has not had a material effect on our operations to date. System equipment and operating costs have not significantly increased in price, and the price of wireless messaging devices has tended to decline in recent years. This reduction in costs has generally been reflected in lower prices charged to subscribers who purchase their wireless messaging devices. Our general operating expenses, such as salaries, site rent for transmitter locations, employee benefits and occupancy costs, are subject to normal inflationary pressures.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preceding discussion and analysis of financial condition and statement of income is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to those related to the impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization and goodwill, accounts receivable allowances, revenue recognition, asset retirement obligations, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or condition.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Goodwill\nWe are required to evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, amortizable intangible assets and goodwill. Amortizable intangible assets include customer related intangibles, technology based intangibles, contract based intangibles and\nmarketing intangibles that primarily resulted from our previous acquisitions. Such intangibles are being amortized over periods up to ten years. Quarterly, we assess whether circumstances exist which suggest that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When applicable, we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets and certain amortizable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. In assessing the recoverability of these assets, we forecasted estimated enterprise-level cash flows based on operating assumptions such as revenue forecasted by product line. If the forecast of undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying value of the long-lived assets, we would record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value exceeded the fair value of such assets.\nGoodwill resulting from our acquisitions is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or when events or circumstances suggest a potential impairment has occurred. We performed this annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2015. We evaluate goodwill for impairment between annual tests if indicators of impairment exist. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we compare the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the implied fair value is less than the carrying value of the goodwill, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss. For purposes of the goodwill impairment evaluation, the Company as a whole is considered the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated under a market based approach using the fair value of the Company's common stock. A confirmatory discounted cash flow analysis is also used to assess whether impairment exists. This calculation requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nWe did not record any impairment of long-lived assets, definite lived intangible assets or goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nAccounts Receivable Allowances\nOur two most significant allowance accounts are an allowance for doubtful accounts and an allowance for service credits. Provisions for these allowances are recorded on a monthly basis and are included as a component of general and administrative expenses and a reduction of revenue, respectively.\nEstimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on historical collection experience and current and forecasted trends. In determining these percentages, we review historical write-offs, including comparisons of write-offs to provisions for doubtful accounts and as a percentage of revenues. We compare the ratio of the allowance to gross receivables to historical levels, and monitor amounts collected and related statistics. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.6 million,$0.7 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We write off receivables when they are deemed uncollectible. While write-offs of customer accounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that our future write-off experience will be consistent with historical experience, which could result in material differences in the allowance for doubtful accounts and related provisions.\nThe allowance for service credits and maintenance related provisions is based on historical credit percentages, current credit and aging trends, historical actual payment trends and actual credit experience. We analyze our past credit experience over several time frames. Using this analysis along with current operational data including existing experience of credits issued and the time frames in which credits are issued, we establish an appropriate allowance for service credits. The allowance for service credits was $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This allowance reduces accounts receivable for lost and non-returned pagers to the expected realizable amounts and for free wireless services. In addition, this allowance reduces software maintenance revenue. While credits issued have been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that future credit experience will be consistent with historical experience, which could result in material differences in the allowance for service credits and maintenance related provisions.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when four basic criteria have been met:\n\u2022there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;\n\u2022delivery has occurred or services rendered;\n\u2022the fee is fixed or determinable; and\n\u2022collectability is reasonably assured.\nAmounts billed to customers, but not meeting the above revenue recognition criteria are deferred until all four criteria have been met.\nSigned agreements are used as evidence of an arrangement. If a contract signed by the customer does not exist, we use a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. If both a signed contract and a purchase order exist, we consider the signed contract to be the final persuasive evidence of an arrangement. At the time a contract is executed, we evaluate the contract to assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable. If the fee is assessed as not being fixed or determinable, revenue recognition is delayed until this assessment can be made. Additionally, we review customer creditworthiness and our historical ability to collect payments due.\nOur wireless revenue consists primarily of service, rental and maintenance fees charged to customers on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Revenue also includes the sale of messaging devices directly to customers and other companies that resell our services. With respect to revenue recognition for multiple deliverables, we evaluated these revenue arrangements and determined that two separate units of accounting exist, paging service revenue and product sales. We recognize paging service revenue over the period the service is performed; revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment or installation. We have a variety of billing arrangements with our customers resulting in deferred revenue from advance billings and accounts receivables for billing in-arrears arrangements.\nOur software revenue consists primarily of the sale of software (license fees), professional services (primarily installation and training), equipment (to be used in conjunction with the software) and maintenance support (post-contract support). The software is licensed to end users under an industry standard software license agreement. Our software products are considered to be off-the-shelf software\u201d as the software is marketed as a stock item that customers can use without customization.\nSoftware revenue consists of two primary components: (1) operations revenue consisting of software license revenue, professional services revenue and equipment sales, and (2) maintenance revenue.\nWe generally sell software licenses, professional services, equipment and maintenance in multiple-element arrangements. At inception of the arrangement, we allocate the arrangement consideration to the software deliverables (software licenses, professional services and maintenance) as a group and to the non-software deliverables (equipment and maintenance on equipment, when applicable) using the relative selling price method. When performing this allocation, the estimated selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE\u201d), third party evidence of fair value ( TPE\u201d), or if VSOE and TPE are not available, the best estimated selling price ( BESP\u201d) for selling the element on a stand-alone basis. We have determined that TPE is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.\nOur standard post contract support (maintenance) is allocated using VSOE as an input in the relative selling price allocation. For software licenses, professional services, equipment and premium maintenance we have determined that neither VSOE nor TPE is available and as such, we have used BESP as an input in order to allocate our arrangement fees. We determine BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices take into consideration our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.\nIn multiple-element arrangements, the arrangement consideration allocated to our non-software deliverables (equipment) is generally recognized upon shipment or delivery to the customer depending on delivery method of Free on Board (\"FOB\") shipping or FOB destination, respectively.\nFor our software deliverables, which include software licenses, professional services, and post contract support (maintenance), we further allocate arrangement consideration using the residual method. As noted above, we have not established VSOE for our software licenses, professional services and premium maintenance. However, we have established, and continue to maintain, VSOE for our standard post contract support (maintenance). We recognize contract revenue ratably over the longer of the estimated services delivery period or the maintenance term. If delivery of the software and services is completed before the end of the maintenance period, then the remaining deferred revenue associated with these elements is recognized in full at this time. Any unrecognized revenue related to maintenance continues to be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the maintenance period. If the period of delivery to the customer is not known, license and professional services revenue will be recognized when software and professional services are fully delivered to the customer and the maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining contractual term of the agreement. Prior to January 1, 2014, we did not have a method for reasonably estimating the services period and therefore, license and professional services revenue was primarily recognized at the time of full delivery. In 2014, we developed a methodology for reasonably estimating the services period and have been able to recognize license and professional services revenue ratably on most contracts. Generally, the defined services period for most of our projects is shorter than the maintenance term.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize liabilities and corresponding assets for future obligations associated with the retirement of assets. We have paging equipment assets, principally transmitters, which are located on leased locations. The underlying leases generally require the removal of equipment at the end of the lease term; therefore, a future obligation exists.\nAsset retirement costs are reflected in paging equipment assets with depreciation expense recognized over the estimated lives, which range between one and five years. The asset retirement costs were $3.6 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net increase in asset retirement costs in 2015 is related to the revised deconstruction forecast during the period. Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included benefits of $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, related to depreciation of these asset retirement costs.The benefits in depreciation expense for these years are due to net reductions to the asset retirement costs as a result of changes in the timing and costs of the transmitter deconstructions. The asset retirement costs and the corresponding liabilities that have been recorded to date generally relate to either current plans to consolidate networks or to the removal of assets at a future terminal date.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, accrued other liabilities included $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of asset retirement liabilities related to our efforts to reduce the number of transmitters in operation; other long-term liabilities included $7.5 million and $6.8 million, respectively, related primarily to an estimate of the costs of deconstructing assets through the terminal date. The primary variables associated with these estimates are the number of transmitters and related equipment to be removed, the timing of removal, and a fair value estimate of the outside contractor fees to remove each asset. The fair value estimate of contractor fees to remove each asset is assumed to escalate by 4% each year through the terminal date.\nThe cost associated with the estimated removal costs and timing refinements due to ongoing network rationalization activities will accrete to a total liability of $9.3 million. The accretion was recorded on the interest method utilizing the following discount rates for the specified periods:\n\n (1) Transmitters moved to new sites resulting in additional liability. \n (2) Weighted average credit adjusted risk-free rate used to discount downward revision to estimated future cash flows.  The total estimated liability is based on transmitter locations remaining after we have consolidated the number of networks we operate and assume the underlying leases continue to be renewed to that future date. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $0.7 million, $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for accretion expense on the asset retirement obligation liabilities.\nWe believe these estimates are reasonable at the present time, but we can give no assurance that changes in technology, our financial condition, the economy or other factors would not result in higher or lower asset retirement obligations. Any variations from our estimates would generally result in a change in the assets and liabilities in equal amounts, and operating results would differ in the future by any difference in depreciation expense and accretion expense.\nIncome Taxes - Uncertainties and Deferred Income Tax Assets (\"DTAs\")\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of tax-related assets, liabilities and income tax expense. These estimates and assumptions are based on the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d). The ASC includes provisions relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.\nWe file our income tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are required to evaluate the recoverability of our DTAs. The assessment is to determine whether based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than a 50% probability) that all or some portion of the DTAs will be realized in the future.\nThe DTA valuation allowance reflects management's judgment concerning the ultimate recoverability of the DTAs. As of December 31, 2015, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the net DTAs of $84.0 million will be recoverable. Approximately 85.0% of our net DTAs consist of net operating loss carryforwards. For the three years ended December 31, 2014,\nthe Company has utilized approximately $121.7 million of net operating losses which translates into approximately $48.5 million of DTAs and we expect to utilize $26.4 million of NOLs for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe consider both positive and negative evidence when evaluating the recoverability of our DTAs. During the fourth quarter of each year, we prepare a multi-year forecast of taxable income for our operations. In preparing our analysis of the recoverability of our DTAs, we consider the following possible sources of taxable income:\n1. Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.\nWe consider 100% of our existing taxable temporary differences when estimating the amount of recoverable DTAs. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $5.5 million of taxable temporary differences which we believe will be recoverable over the next 20 year carryforward period. Most of these differences relate to software intangible assets that have a 15 year recovery period.\n2. Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nAs described above, we use a multi-year forecast of taxable income for the Company. DTAs are realizable if future deductible amounts would reduce taxes that would be paid on future taxable income excluding the reversal of existing temporary differences.\n3. Taxable income in carryback years to the extent permitted by tax law.\nWe have exhausted our carryback potential and now only have carryforwards available.\n4. Tax planning strategies.\nSince 2012, we elected to capitalize and amortize over 10 years, software research and development costs. In the near term, this has the effect of increasing taxable income and the amount of net operating losses utilized.\nThe balance of the DTA valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $45.8 million and $114.2 million, respectively. The estimated recoverable DTAs at December 31, 2015 totaled $84.0 million and at December 31, 2014 was $24.1 million. These estimated recoverable amounts represent approximately 64.7% and 17.5%, respectively, of the total DTAs before the valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRecent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Since the ASU was issued, the FASB has issued several changes, most notably in July 2015, which delayed the effective date. Our effective date is January 1, 2018 and while early adoption to the original effective date of January 1, 2017 is permitted, we have elected not to early adopt.\nASU No. 2014-09 creates a five-step model that requires companies to exercise judgment when considering all relevant facts and circumstances in the determination of when and how revenue is recognized. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We have not selected a transition method. We continue to evaluate the potential impact from this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which was issued as part of the FASB's simplification initiative, which has an objective of identifying areas of GAAP that can be simplified for the purpose of reducing an entity's costs while continuing to provide useful information to financial statement users. ASU 2015-17 allows entities to classify deferred tax assets or liabilities as non-current rather than splitting the balance between a current and non-current balance. Entities may apply this new guidance prospectively or retrospectively when adopting this standard.\nThe effective date is January 1, 2017, however, early adoption of the standard is effective immediately. We have decided to early adopt this guidance and have classified our DTA as non-current at December, 31, 2015. Early adoption did not have a material impact on our overall financial statements and does not alter our overall financial results. We applied the guidance retrospectively for the purposes of providing comparable financial statement results. Retrospective application of this standard resulted in a\nreclassification of the current DTAs of $2.2 million, net of the valuation allowance to a non-current asset in our balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 2014. Retrospective application had no other financial statement impact.\nThe FASB is expected to issue an ASU on the accounting for leases in the first quarter of 2016. The new standard is expected to establish a right of use ( ROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either financing or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.\nThe new ASU is expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is expected to be required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. While we are still evaluating the impact of the potential new standard on our consolidated financial statements, we expect that upon adoption we will recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities and that the amounts could be material.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use a non-GAAP financial measure as a key element in determining performance for purposes of incentive compensation under our annual Short-Term Incentive Plan (\"STIP\"). That non-GAAP financial measure is operating cash flow ( OCF\u201d), defined as EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment (EBITDA is defined as operating income plus depreciation, amortization, accretion and impairment, each determined in accordance with GAAP). Purchases of property and equipment are also determined in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of STIP performance, OCF was as follows for the periods stated:\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

decreases in demand for paging services. Software revenue increased 4.0% in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by higher maintenance revenue. \n\n- Operating expenses decreased 3.1% in 2015 compared to 2014. This was largely due to decreased selling and marketing expenses from lower wireless revenue.\n\n- Net cash provided by operating activities was $38 million in 2015, down from $41.6 million in 2014. The company paid $15 million for stock repurchases and $13.3 million in dividends in 2015.  \n\n- At December 31, 2015, the company had $111.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. \n\n- The company released $68.4 million of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2015, resulting in an income tax benefit of $57.9 million for the year.\n\n- The company expects wireless revenue to continue declining but plans to mitigate this through growth in software revenue.
